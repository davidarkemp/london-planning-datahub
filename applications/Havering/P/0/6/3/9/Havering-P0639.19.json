  "decision_conditions": [
    "The physical changes to the building and site arising from the change of use proposed, would materially change the rural character of the site and associated land and would contribute to the development conflicting with the purposes of the Green Belt, thereby comprising of inappropriate development and irrevocably harming openness. In the absence of very special circumstances that clearly outweigh the harm identified to the Green Belt, by reason of inappropriateness and other harm, the proposal is considered to be contrary to the Green Belt policy contained in the National Planning Policy Framework and Policies DC45 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 19-06-2019.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£4,220. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
