  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until the developer has submitted a remediation strategy to the local planning authority detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with and obtained written approval from the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved to a programme approved as part of the approved remediation strategy.",
    "Reasons:-",
    "To ensure that any contamination identified during works which has not previously identified is disposed of appropriately.",
    "The submitted landscaping scheme, received by the Council on 28th February, 2013 and referenced  \"JC0057A1/UC/ARCH/PL/GA/100 Rev 01\", and any necessary changes associated with the proposed amendments shall be implemented in the first available planting season following the commencement of the relevant phase of the development, and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next available planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The development shall be undertaken in accordance with the submitted details relating to the use of building materials and site boundary treatment, in accordance to the following drawings;",
    "Block/Site Plan as Proposed (JC0057A1/UC/ARCH/PL/GA/002 Rev 2) -",
    "Pump House Section and Elevations (JC0057A1/UC/ARCH/PL/GA/102 Rev 2)",
    "Toilet Block Section and Elevations (JC0057A1/UC/ARCH/PL/GA/202 Rev 2)",
    "Proposed Foul Water Drainage and Potable Water Supply (JC0057A1/UC/UTL/PL/GA/001 Rev 2)",
    "Proposed Surface Water Drainage (JC0057A1 /UC/LD/PL/GA/OOI Rev 2)",

    "Stockpiled materials shall not exceed 3m in height.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the visual amenities of the Green Belt and visual amenity generally, in accordance with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Apart from preparatory works, no construction work shall commence until the details of flood lighting and its likely impact upon the wildlife has be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The floodlighting shall be provided and operated in strict accordance with the approved details.",

Submission of this detail would ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC58.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018."
