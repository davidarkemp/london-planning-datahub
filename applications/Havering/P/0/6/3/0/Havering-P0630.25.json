    "The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space of approximately 62.35 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres contrary to Policy 9 (ii) of the Havering Local Plan but also, Policy 9 (vi) in respect to providing on-site parking. The proposal would therefore result in the loss of family housing within the Borough for which there is a significant identified need. The proposal fails to comply Policy 9 of Havering's Local Plan 2016-2031 for the subdivision of existing residential properties to self contained homes.",
    "In the absence of a swept path analysis/tracking plans, the creation, siting and proximity of the car parking spaces for the development to the front and rear of the site would result in inadequate access and egress arrangements that would be harmful to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies 9 vi, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Stephenson (Agent) by e-mail on 15th July 2025."
