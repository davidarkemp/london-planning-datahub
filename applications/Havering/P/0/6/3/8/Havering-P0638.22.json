    "The proposed first floor side/rear extensions and loft conversion to include crown roof/roof slope alteration would, by reason of the cumulative impact of their bulk, mass, height and proximity to neighbouring boundaries, appear over-dominant in the rear garden scene and be an intrusive and overbearing form of development, particularly in relation to nos. 10 and 12 Wykeham Avenue, resulting in an adverse impact on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process, the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £2,700 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £816,200 (x £125 per sqm)",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal involving setting the first floor side/rear extension away from the common boundary with nos. 10 and 12 Wykeham Avenue by 2m and that ensuring that the first-floor rear windows to master bedroom 2, ensuite and bethoom would be obscure glazed and non-opening unless 1.70m above finished floor level were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application. However, the resultant bulk, mass and height of the  proposed extensions were considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
