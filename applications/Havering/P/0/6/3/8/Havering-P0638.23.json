    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing open character of the area so allocated and that the new buildings will only be permitted in certain circumstances. The proposed development would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and mass, result in disproportionate additions to the property over and above its original form and would also by way of the overall bulk and amount of development, including the cumulative impact of increasing the height and size of the annexe/outhouse, cause harm to the openness of the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case. The development proposals are therefore contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and mass, lack subservience to the existing dwelling, constitute an incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive form of development in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Parkers Design via email on 7th November 2023.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £48,150 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £8,025 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 321 square metres.",
