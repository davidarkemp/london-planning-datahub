  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of the approval of P0935.24 (10 April 2027).",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to first occupation cycle storage as agreed under application Q0231.24 shall be provided unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority. Those measures as agreed and installed must then be maintained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Prior to first occupation waste/refuse storage as agreed under application Q0231.24 shall be provided unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority. Those measures as agreed and installed must then be maintained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be fitted with Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with these details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "Should the use of the premises be E(a) (retail) then it shall operate only between the hours of 7:00AM and 21:00PM Monday to Saturday and 08:00 and 21:00 Sunday, Bank and Public Holidays. If the premises are to be used for any other purpose within Class E, other than E(a) then the hours of use shall be restricted to 8.00AM and 18:00PM on Monday to Saturday and not at all on Sunday or Bank and Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
