  "decision_conditions": [
    "It is considered that the proposed two storey rear and side extensions would by virtue of their excessive scale, poor design and mass, lack subservience to the existing dwelling fail to maintain the characteristic separation of the site and would appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and front street scene contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and the Sector 3 of the Emerson Park Policy Area. Further, the proposal is inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph 124 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, which states that good design is a key aspect of sustainable development.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it will be given to Mr T.A. Harris on 13-11-18"
