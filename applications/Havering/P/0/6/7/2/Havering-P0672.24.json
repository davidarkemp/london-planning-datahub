    "The dwelling would, by reason of its excessive bulk, mass and scale on a constrained plot with an awkward footprint and poor design, appear as an incongruous and cramped development in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and inconsistent with the prevailing character of development in the local area.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers. The design approach adopted would provide poor outlook and a sense of enclosure from the main ground floor habitable room resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of this proposed 1-bed dwelling.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
