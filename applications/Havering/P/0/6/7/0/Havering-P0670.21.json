    "The unauthorised development by reason of the loss of significant number of existing car parking spaces, has given rise to an inadequate on site car parking provision, resulting in an unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policy DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
