The proposed dormer would, by reason of its height, position and bulk appear out of scale and character whilst compromising the architectural integrity and composition of the recently conceived building which would be materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary in conflict with the design aims of the Framework, London Plan, LP Policy 26 and the guidance in the SPD.",
