    "The development presents negatively from the street and has a detrimental impact on the character of the street-scene. The use and extent of non-porous surfacing is readily visible from the street and exacerbated by the loss of planting and mature trees which might otherwise have lessened the visual impacts.  The position of the site forward of adjacent front gardens, means that it is especially prominent and the extent of and appearance of the hard surfaced area, is of a low quality visually, at odds with surrounding patterns of development and detrimental to the street-scene and local character thereby contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 26 and 27, in addition to objectives of the NPPF specifically Para 135.",
    "The retention of the development as sought would create conditions likely to necessitate access being taken over the footway and raised kerb. Travelling over the footway and negotiating other street-furniture in this location would be detrimental to the safety of pedestrians and the free flow of traffic. In the absence of any evidence otherwise such an arrangement would be Para 115 of the NPPF which accepts that development might be refused where it would have an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.",
    "The use of non-porous materials and extent of hard-surfacing in conjunction with the failure of the applicant to demonstrate how the development would satisfactorily address surface water run off and prevent risk to people and property is contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 27 and 32.",
