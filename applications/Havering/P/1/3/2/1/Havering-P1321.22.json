    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Local Plan policy 26.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with the Local Plan policy 24 and London Plan Policy T6.1.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, a scheme of hard and soft landscaping to include details of boundary treatment, which shall include indications of all existing trees/hedges and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping proposed",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with Local Plan policy 34.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Construction Method statement shall include details of:",

    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, other than porches erected in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Local Plan policies 7 and 26.",
    "The hard surface hereby approved (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding (Local Plan Policy 32 and London Plan Policy SI 13).",
    "Prior to the commencement of any works pursuant to this permission the developer shall submit for the written approval of the Local Planning Authority;",

    "b)\tA Phase II (Site Investigation) Report if the Phase I Report confirms the possibility of a significant risk to any sensitive receptors.  This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the sites ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",
    "c)\tA Phase III (Remediation Strategy) Report if the Phase II Report confirms the presence of a significant pollutant linkage requiring remediation.  A detailed remediation scheme to bring the site to",
    "If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b)\tFollowing completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development, an assessment shall be undertaken of the impact of:",
    "a)\trailways noise (in accordance with Technical memorandum, \"Calculation of Railway Noise\", 1995)",
    "b)\tvibration from the use of the railway lines",
    "Upon the site.  Following this, a scheme detailing the measures to protect residents from railway noise and vibration is to be submitted to, approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, implemented prior to occupancy taking place.",
    "Reason:",
    "To protect residents from transportation noise and vibration.",
    "The building(s) shall be so constructed as to provide sound insulation of 45 DnT,w + Ctr dB (minimum value) against airborne noise to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties.",
    "The proposed development shall be implemented in accordance with the Tree Protection Plan on Drawing No. OS 2525-22.1 and the Arboricultural Impact Assessment prepared by OpenSpaces Landscape Architecture, Ref OS 2529-22-Doc 1, dated November 2022, including any recommendations.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the development accords with Policy 27 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy G7 of the London Plan. It will also ensure accordance with Section 197 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason:",
    "In order to comply with Policy SI 5 of the London Plan.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with the London Plan Policy T5. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
