  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would have a detrimental impact upon the significance of a non-designated heritage asset and fail to make a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy DC67 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Heritage Supplementary Planning Document Adopted April 2011. Further, the proposal is considered contrary to guidance contained within paragraph 197 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its servicing, loading and access arrangements, potential conflict between customer and residential parking as well as increased vehicle movements in the vicinity of the junction, cause harm to the safe and convenient operation of the highway in the vicinity of the site and therefore be contrary to Policies DC32, DC34 and DC36 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, which seek to ensure that new development does not have an adverse impact on the functioning of the road hierarchy.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Intelliarch Ltd via email on 2nd December 2020."
