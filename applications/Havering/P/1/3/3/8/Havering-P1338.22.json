    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and would be harmful to the appearance of the host building, surrounding area and would fail to preserve and enhance the Conservation Area contrary to Policy 26 and 28 of the Local Plan and Policy HC1 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development is considered to represent a substantial impact to the amenity of the occupiers of the neighbouring flats located on the second floor. The development would represent a significant loss of light, outlook and increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers on the second floor and in particular, the middle flat, whose only source of light is the two rooflights contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development fails to meet the required minimum overall floor space standards and the minimum floorspace required for double bedrooms of at least 11.5sqm resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the provision of adequate and accessible cycle storage can be achieved within the site and thus would discourage the use of sustainable modes of transport contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent via email on 30th November 2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1478.00 based on the calculation of Ã?????????£25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £7390.00 based on calculation of Ã?????????£125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
