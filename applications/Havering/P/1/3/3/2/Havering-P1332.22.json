    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans and documents (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to the commencement of the development hereby approved, details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until full details of doors and windows and samples of all materials including rainwater goods to be used in the construction of the extension(s) hereby permitted are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the doors, windows, materials and rainwater goods to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will safeguard the appearance of the building and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The proposed flank window at no.9 Bridge Avenue to the staircase shall be  obscure-glazed, and  non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7m above the floor / staircase where the window is installed.",
    "Reason - In the interest of privacy and to protect the amenity of the adjacent neighbours",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, car parking provision in accordance with the approved plans, including the provision of electrical vehicle charging points for each house shall be provided and thereafter such provision shall be made permanently available for use, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
