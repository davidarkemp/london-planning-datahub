    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019,  consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons were given to the applicant and discussed in some detail before the formal issuing of the Decision Notice.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £2,697.50.",
    "The development would also be liable for the Havering CIL of £13,487.50.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its detailed design and relationship to the existing dwellinghouse at number 60 Halesworth Road would represent an incongruous element in the rear garden areas and would be out of character with the surrounding area and harmful to the appearance of the streetscene contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and position, result in significant harm to the amenity of future and existing occupiers of 60 Halesworth Road contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD."
