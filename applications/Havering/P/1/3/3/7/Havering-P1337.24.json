    "The cumulative impact of the proposed three storey extension which forms part of loft alteration and the extended rear dormer window would be out of scale, be disproportionately large, overly prominent and relate unacceptably to the existing dwelling with a top heavy appearance which would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden harmful to the appearance of the Hall Lane Policy Area, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations and Hall Lane Policy Area Supplementary Planning Documents, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area.",
    "The continuation of the first floor rear extension up into the loft, to create a three storey extension would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development which would overbear and dominate the outlook and amenity of the adjacent neighbours at No.2 Engayne Gardens, Upminster when viewed from their garden contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "In case of an appeal informative",
    "The applicant should note, in the case the application is allowed on appeal, that they should engage with UK Power Network prior to commencing on site, due to the close proximity to the neighbouring substation and to take into consideration any party wall issues.",
