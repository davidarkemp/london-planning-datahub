  "description": "The Proposal is to increase the single storey rear extension, convert the side elevation lean-to into side extension with addition of first-floor level to include front and rear dormers.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extensions and alterations would, in particular with respect to the roof alterations by significantly converting to half hipped roof and incorporating bulky dormer windows to the front as well as the rear would appear an incongruous feature which would be visually intrusive, would not be in keeping with the character of the street scene, would be harmful to the appearance of the host dwelling and detrimental to rear garden environment of the adjoining neighbours in contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extensions would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and proximity to the boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, loss of sunlight and be harmful to neighbouring properties contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Malcolm Clarke via email on 04th November 2020."
