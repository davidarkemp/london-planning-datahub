    "The proposed development by reason of its cramped appearance, excessive width, scale, bulk, mass and design would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed two storey side extension would result in an uncharacteristic confined relationship with the detached neighbour. It has not been demonstrated that this relationship combined with the depth, height and position to the boundary would not be detrimental to the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The applicant should note that the application under consideration is in respect of a two storey side extension as described to a residential dwelling, and not for a new dwelling. Separate planning consent would be required for a new dwelling or any change of use to a House of Multiple Occupancy (HMO).",
