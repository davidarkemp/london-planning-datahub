    "The proposed side extension would, by reason of its design and mass, appear unacceptably dominant, visually intrusive and representing an over-development of the subject dwelling resulting in an extension which appears bulky and awkward while detracting from the existing features to the front elevation harming the character of the host dwelling and its contribution to the wider street scene contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity along the common boundary to No. 23 Berwick Road significant reduce the availability of light into a habitable room (bedroom) window along the adjacent flank wall which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers of this property contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate off-street car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
