  "decision_conditions": [
    "This site is located within an area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt. The LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF states that inappropriate development should only be approved in very special circumstances.  The proposed development would be materially larger than the buildings to which it is seeking to replace, would impact on openness and accordingly is considered to be represent inappropriate development. Inappropriate development is by definition harmful to the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been advanced that clearly outweigh this and other identified harms.  Accordingly, the proposal is considered contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development, which would function as a self-contained residential unit in the garden, would result in an unprecedented and unacceptable impact to amenity, including overlooking and loss of privacy for future occupants of the property contrary to DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 1/12/20.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £18375 for Havering CIL and £3675 for Mayoral CIL. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
