    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design, height and full site coverage and depth appear as a contrived development and as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, failing to reflect the prevailing pattern of development in the locality to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development, due to its excessive site coverage and the proximity of the ground floor main habitable room windows to the rear boundary of the site and the provision of a rear bedroom with obscure glazing would result in poor outlook and aspect to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers resulting in substandard residential accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Local plan.",
    "The proposal by reason of its height, bulk and massing and proximity to the site's rear and side boundaries would constitute an unneighbourly development resulting in an overbearing impact to the detriment of the amenity enjoyed by these occupiers in their private amenity space. This is contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposal by reason of inadequate access arrangements from the garage would result in cars entering and exiting the site needing to drive over the footway to the detriment of the safety of pedestrians.  Furthermore, the proposal would result in conflict with the use of the existing turning head, which would exacerbate the existing issue of overspill on-street parking to the detriment of the safety of other road users and pedestrian, contrary to Policy 24 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent via email on 31st October 2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £3325.50 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £16762.50 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
