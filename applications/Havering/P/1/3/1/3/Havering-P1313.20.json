  "description": "Variation of Condition No. 18 of planning permission ref: P2031.16 to alter requirement for M4(2) compliance of upper level self-contained flats.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No dwelling unit shall be occupied until the car/vehicle parking area shown on approved drawing 1427_PL_101 Rev F has been completed to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority, and thereafter, the area shall be kept free of obstruction and permanently made available for the parking of vehicles associated with the development and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety and in order that the development accords with the LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC33.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be constructed of the materials agreed under reference Q0221.19 unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Prior to first occupation the landscaping works agreed under reference Q0025.20 shall be implemented. Any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.  It will also ensure accordance with Section 197 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",

    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied until cycle storage as agreed under reference Q0165.20 has been implemented to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Prior to first occupation boundary treatment, the details of which were agreed under reference Q0221.19, shall be installed in accordance with those details submitted to the Local Planning Authority unless otherwise agreed in writing.

    "Within 6 months of the date of this decision, details confirming full accreditation, or failing that the best result achievable for the site negotiated with the Metropolitan Police Designing Out Crime Officers, shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and approved in writing. Those measures as agreed shall then be maintained in perpetuity unless otherwise agreed in writing with the LPA.",
    "Reason:-",
    "At the time of writing it has not been evidenced that the development meets with Secured by Design standards as there had only been a part discharge of the original SBD condition, in the interest of creating safer, sustainable communities and to reflect guidance in Policies CP17 and DC63 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the NPPF.",
    "The vehicle parking serving the dwellings hereby permitted shall be allocated in accordance with the details submitted and agreed under reference Q0358.19 and the measures indicated within that submission to manage and maintain the service road free from obstruction by parked vehicles shall be maintained in perpetuity. All agreed details/facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter for the lifetime of the development.",

    "The development shall not be occupied until the approved scheme of works to the public highway agreed under reference Q0256.19 have been completed by or on behalf of the applicant in full in accordance with the Local Planning Authority's written approval.",

The works shall be carried out strictly in accordance with those details unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority. The area of play shall be retained thereafter permanently.",
    "Reason:",
    "To meet identified needs for additional playspace for the new development and to provide secure facilities for children within the existing residential units. The implementation of an approved scheme prior to occupation is considered necessary in order that the development complies with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies CP7, DC18 and DC20, and London Plan policy 3.6 and the Shaping neighbourhoods: play and informal recreation SPG.",
    "At least two of the dwellings hereby approved shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(3)(2)(a) of the Building Regulations - Wheelchair Adaptable Dwellings.

    "Prior to first occupation the measures agreed under reference Q0240.19 for Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) shall be implemented. The scheme as agreed shall be retained permanently thereafter for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that drainage and discharge from the site is managed and maintained, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC48 and DC51 and the SuDs Developer Guide.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 Article 3, Schedule 2, Part 1, (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no development shall take place under Classes A, B, C, D or E, excepting sheds up to 10 m3 in size, unless permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to first occupation the external lighting scheme agreed under reference Q0207.20 shall be implemented to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority, unless otherwise agreed in writing. The lighting shall be provided and operated in strict accordance with the approved scheme and thereafter maintained permanently.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",

    "(a)\tNecessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms;",
    "(b)\tDirectly related to the development; and",
    "(c)\tFairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.",

    "Before occupation of the residential/ commercial unit(s) hereby approved, it is a requirement to have the property/properties officially Street Named and Numbered by our Street Naming and Numbering Team.
