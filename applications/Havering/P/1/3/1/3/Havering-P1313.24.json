    "The pat single, part two storey side extension, due to its projection forward of the recess wall of the host dwelling, its cropped roof design and lack of visual break from the main ridge of the host dwelling, is not considered to be subservient to the roof of the property and instead is deemed to be a visually intrusive and unrelated addition to the subject property that amplifies the unbalancing of the semi-detached pair at roof level, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The part single, part two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its projection beyond and proximity to the shared boundaries with no. 76 Squirrels Heath Road at ground floor level and with no. 80 Squirrels Heath Road at ground and first floor level, is an intrusive and unneighbourly development that has an adverse effect on the amenity of both neighbouring occupiers through the creation of an overbearing form of development which gives rise to a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook and light, to contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agents via email on 27/06/2025."
