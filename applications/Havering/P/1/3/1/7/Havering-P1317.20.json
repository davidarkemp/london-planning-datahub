  "description": "Erection of a two storey residential building comprising 1x3-bed and 1x2-bed self contained residential unit with associated parking and amenity space.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The bulk, scale and mass of the proposed development in close proximity to the boundaries would appear as an unneighbourly cramped overdevelopment of the site, incongruous with the local pattern of development and out of character with the surrounding built form, therefore harmful to local character and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to London Plan Policy 7.4 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal fails to provide ample quality outdoor amenity spaces and poor quality outlook from habitable rooms to the detriment of the future occupiers, contrary to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Th proposed development would by reason of its excessive bulk, mass and scale on a constrained site within close proximity of the boundaries result in an visually intrusive form of development that would compromise the amenity and enjoyment of the neighbours private outdoor space due to the increased sense of enclosure created by the proposal, contrary to the objectives of DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to agent via email.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£21,450. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
