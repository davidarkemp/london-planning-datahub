    "The proposed first floor rear loft extension would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment harmful to the established character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
