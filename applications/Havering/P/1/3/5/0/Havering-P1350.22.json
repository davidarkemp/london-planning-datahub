    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "If during development works any contamination should be encountered which was not previously identified in the Site Investigation then works should halt immediately and the Local Planning Authority consulted to agree appropriate further action.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The development is situated on or within 250 metres of a current or historic landfill site or gravel pit. Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gas.  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect those redeveloping this site and any future occupants from potential landfill gas.",
    "All building operations in connection with the site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
