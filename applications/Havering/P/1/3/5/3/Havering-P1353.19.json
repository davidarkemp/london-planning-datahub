    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its excessive height, bulk and mass,  would appear unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment and street scene, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the Adopted London Borough of Havering Supplementary Planning Document for Residential Extensions and Alterations 2011, and Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008.",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its combined height, bulk, mass and position close to the boundaries of the site in conjunction with the sloping ground level within the site line is considered to be an unneighbourly development which is out of scale with its surroundings and creates a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, that is harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers, contrary to the London Borough of Havering  Residential Extensions and Alteration SPD 2011, and Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Development Control Policies Plan Document 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Hume (Agent) by phone.
