It would represent a materially intrusive and unneighbourly form of development which results in a loss of outlook, creates a sense of enclosure and overbearing impact, therefore being materially harmful to the amenity of No. 23 Hawthorn Avenue contrary to Policies 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD."
