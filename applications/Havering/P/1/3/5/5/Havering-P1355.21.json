    "The application has failed to demonstrate that there is an identified need for the proposed GP surgery and that the proposed use could not be provided in within a purpose built facility which is easily accessible by public transport within the surrounding area. Therefore the proposed development fails to comply with Development Control Policies Development Plan policy DC1, Draft Local Plan policy 3 and London Plan policy S2.",
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Draft Local Plan policy 7.",
    "In the absence of a parking design and management plan for the GP surgery and absence of a parking survey it has not been demonstrated that the proposals would not adversely impact on nearby residents amenity or increase parking stress on the surrounding highway network contrary to Development Control Policies Development Plan policies DC32 and DC33, Draft Local Plan policies 23 and 24 and London Plan policy T6 and T6.5.",
    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight assessment to demonstrate otherwise the proposed extension above the building would reduce the levels of daylight received within the ground floor rooms of the adjoining properties of No. 96 and 88 Chase Cross Road detrimental to their residential amenity contrary to Development Control Policies Development Plan policy DC61 and Draft Local Plan policy 7.",

Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £3,275 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £16,375 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
