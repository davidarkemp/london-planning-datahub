All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",

    "Insufficient information",
    "Prior to the first occupation, the scheme shall be completed  in accordance to the approved detailed (Ref; Q0150.20) . and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of highway safety, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC32.",
    "The proposed windows on the flank elevations shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than obscurity level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut and thereafter maintained, with the exception of any top hung fanlight(s).",
