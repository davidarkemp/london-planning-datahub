  "description": "Demolition of the existing structure on site and construction of a pair of dwellings with communal amenity space, associated car parking, cycle and refuse storage.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwellings would by reason of their overall height, bulk and mass, narrow plan form and design approach including materials and concept appear as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive features harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area inconsistent with surrounding local character contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character and the design principles set out within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing.  The revisions involved a more traditional roof form for the rear projection and scaling back of roof accommodation. The final set of revisions provided 30/10/20 are not judged to overcome earlier concerns raised.",
    "The proposals if granted planning permission on appeal would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £2,475 at a rate of £25 per sqm (99m² x 25).",
    "Additionally the proposals would also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £12,375",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
