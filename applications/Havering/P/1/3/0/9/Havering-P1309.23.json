    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align with any of the relevant exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore comprise of inappropriate development. The proposed backland redevelopment of this  site would have a demonstrable impact on the open character of the Green Belt over that of the existing arrangement of built form and would represent an unwelcome urbanisation of the site. In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF including the purposes of including land within the Green Belt and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) for the whole site, the proposals would be considered to have an unacceptable adverse impact on the protected species on site and surrounding area, contrary to the NPPF 2023 and Policy 30 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Details within the submitted Arboricultural report is deficient with reference to the preserved Oak trees and Hawthorn plant on site, including the woodland adjacent to the boundary of the site, without which the proposals would be considered to be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to the NPPF 2023 and Policy 27 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be  £17,885 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £89,3750 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
