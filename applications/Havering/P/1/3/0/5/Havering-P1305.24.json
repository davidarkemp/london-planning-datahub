    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its height, positioning, scale, bulk and proximity to the nearby properties at no.3 Palm Road and no.67 Mildmay Road, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting an increased sense of enclosure with an overbearing impact contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, positioning close to the side boundaries, bulk and mass and poor spacing appear as a dominant and visually intrusive development, which would unduly enclose the street scene at this prominent location and would also give rise to a form of development which is at odds with the prevailing character of development in the locality, thereby materially harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to  Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The layout of the development due to its proximity to site boundaries would provide inadequate outlook and aspect from ground floor habitable rooms and through insufficient ceiling heights creating substandard accommodation for residents of the proposed dwelling and create poor quality private amenity space to the detriment of the amenity of the occupiers of the host dwelling. As a result, the development would provide substandard residential accommodation contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal would provide no parking for the host dwelling and lack of evidence that parking can be adequately provided for the new dwelling leading to an increased demand for on-road parking in the area to the detriment of the safety of pedestrians and other road users contrary to Policy 24 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1925 based on £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £9625 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
