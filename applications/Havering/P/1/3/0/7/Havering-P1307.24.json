    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used solely for the purposes of a stock room ancillary to the operation of the  business within the building known as No. 15 The Parade, Colchester Road, Romford and shall not be used as a separate unit at any other time, including provision of sales direct to members of public or visiting by the public  and shall not be open to the public at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The use of the building should be restricted to ancillary stock room connected with the building at no.15 The Parade to accord with the terms of the application and to ensure that use of this building does not give rise to undue noise and disturbance to occupiers of neighbouring residential property.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed storage outbuilding shall be used during the operational hours of the premises at No.15 The Parade, Colchester Road, Romford as described on application form for P1308.24 and restricted by condition 4 of planning permission P1308.24 to be between the hours of 0900h and 1700h on Mondays to Fridays and not at all on Saturdays, Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.   There shall be no deliveries to the storage outbuilding or visiting by members of the public outside of these approved hours.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr W Newland (Agent) by phone and e-mail. The revisions involved reducing the size of proposed storage outbuilding. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 12/12/24, 19/02/25 & 24/02/25."
