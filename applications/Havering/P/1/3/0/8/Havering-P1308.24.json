    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, the premises shall only be used for the purposes specified in the application and shall be solely for purposes falling within Class E c) or Class E g) i) and for no other purpose (including any other purpose in Class E of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) (or any provision equivalent to that Class in any Statutory Instrument revoking and/or re-enacting that Order).",
    "Reason:-",
    "This use only is permitted and other uses, either within the same Use Class, or permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 are not acceptable to the Local Planning Authority in this location because of the close proximity to neighbouring residential property and the potential harm to amenity arising through noise and disturbance.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 0900h and 1700h on Mondays to Fridays and not at all on Saturdays, Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity.",
    "The proposed office within the loft extension hereby permitted shall be used only in conjunction with the use of the ground and first floor of the building and shall not be used as a separate unit of commercial use at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority consider that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity.",
    "Use of Building Informative",
    "The applicant should not that the proposal has been assessed in line with plans submitted and confirmation from the agent's e-mail of the 5th & 6th December 2024 in that no change of use is proposed and that the trade counter is no longer part of the scheme. The stock room / storage area to the rear of the building is in conjunction with the office space and day to day running of the business. A change of use may require planning consent and it is suggested that the applicant seek clarity prior to any change should this arise.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is £25/m² and is chargeable for each additional square metre of residential gross internal [floor] (GIA).  Based upon the information supplied with the application, £350 would be payable due to result in a new floor area with 14m² of GIA, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website. You are also advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the appropriate document templates at http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howto"
