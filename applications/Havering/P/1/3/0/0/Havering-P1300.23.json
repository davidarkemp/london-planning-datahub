The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",

The revisions involved providing a 1m set back to the first floor side and hipping the first floor rear extension roof. Depth of the single storey rear extension reduced to 5m and stepped in from the boundary in part. Neighbours were re-consulted for a further 21 days due to revised plans and increase in width of the first floor side extension. A revised block plan was sought for clarity. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 23/11/23 & 18/12/23."
