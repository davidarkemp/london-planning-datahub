    "The proposed part hip to gable roof extension and rear dormer would, by reason of its design, mass and excessive bulk appear out of scale and character with the existing dwelling, appearing incongrous and out of keeping with the streetscene, as well as appearing as a visually intrusive form of development from the perspective of neighbours' rear gardens materially harmful to the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area and harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity along the common boundary to No. 4 Ardleigh Close significantly reduce the availability of light into a habitable room window along the adjacent flank wall which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers of this property contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD."
