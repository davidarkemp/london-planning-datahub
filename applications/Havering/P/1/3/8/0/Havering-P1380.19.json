    "The proposed first floor rear extension, balcony and loft conversion at 51 Parkland Avenue would, by reason of its height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupants of No. 53 Parkland Avenue, Upminster contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development would by virtue of their excessive protrusion, poor design, scale and mass lack subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and front street scene contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Wrench by e-mail on 28/10/2019."
