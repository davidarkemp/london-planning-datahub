    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to any excavation works associated with the installation of the monopole an archaeological \"watching brief\" to monitor development groundworks and to record any archaeological evidence revealed.  These arrangements are to be submitted to, and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, in accordance with the \"watching brief\" proposals agreed pursuant to this condition and shall be carried out by a suitably qualified investigating body acceptable to the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Important archaeological remains may exist on this site.  The Local Planning Authority wishes to ensure that an \"archaeological watching brief\" is carried out during the development's groundworks so that archaeological remains not protected by other measures are investigated and recorded, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC70, Draft Local Plan policy 28 and London Plan (2021) policy HC1.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions within Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), no other antennae or apparatus other than that permitted within the development of this application shall be carried out or installed on the monopole/mast hereby approved without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC61 and D64, Policies 25 and 26 of the draft Local Plan and London Plan (2021) policy D4 and Paragraph 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "Prior to the works to install the 3 no. replacement antennas and monopole, the existing wall mounted mast and antennas to be replaced shall be removed from the site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the character and appearance and the visual amenity of the area and to ensure that visual clutter within the streetscene is kept to a minimum (Policy DC61 and DC64 of the Local Development Framework Development Control, Policies 25, 26 and 34, of the Havering Draft Local Plan, policies D4 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), paragraph 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "Highway legislation",
    "- The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004. Formal",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
