    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed in the Materials Section of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
