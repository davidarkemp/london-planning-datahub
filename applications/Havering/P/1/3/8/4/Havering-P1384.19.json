    "The proposal, by reason of the cramped internal layout resulting from the addition required to facilitate the new unit would diminish outlook would fail to create a high quality living environment for existing/future occupiers and would instead represent a limited and poor quality standard of accommodation. As a result, the proposal would not provide acceptable living conditions for all of the future occupants, to the detriment of residential amenity and contrary to Policies DC4 and  DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed rear extension at first floor level would, by reason of its design and appearance, proportions and detailing, read as an incongruous, visually intrusive and unneighbourly development and would fail to complement or improve the amenity and character of the surrounding area as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
