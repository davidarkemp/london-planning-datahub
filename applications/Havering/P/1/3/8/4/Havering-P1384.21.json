    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until samples of all materials to be used in the external construction of the building(s) are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Prior to their use on site details of all windows, doors, fascia, sills and eaves shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:- Insufficient information has been supplied to judge the appropriateness of the above. Submission of furhter details will ensure the appearance of the proposed development will align with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policiy DC61 of the development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "No above ground works in connection with the approved scheme shall take place until there has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping,  All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping proposed as well as methods of protecting existing species on site and in surrounding sites.  Submission of a scheme prior to commencement will ensure that the development accords with the Development Control P",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "The development shall be carried out in strict accordance with the Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan (TPP) dated 29 April 2021.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC60 and DC61.  It will also ensure accordance with Section 197 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990",
    "Prior to first occupation of the building hereby permitted an action plan to achieve bronze level TfL Sustainable Travel Active Responsible Safe (STARS) shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with TfL. The plan as submitted shall seek to promote and encourage sustainable travel to and from school, to improve road safety, air quality and pupils' ability to travel independently. The plan as approved shall be monitored and reviewed annually and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval via the TfL STARS online website with a view to achieve bronze level accreditation within one year of completion of works and thereafter maintain an active and TfL accredited travel plan for at least three years.",
    "Reason:-  In the interests of sustainability.",
    "Prior to the development being brought into use, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained. Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the Local Planning Authority to verify boiler emissions.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until a scheme for any new plant or machinery is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to achieve the following standard - Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive property shall not exceed LA90 -10dB. Plant and machinery shall be maintained thereafter in accordance with the approved scheme.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to assess the noise levels of the plant or machinery to be used on site. Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use, will prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties in accordance with Policies DC55 and DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing. The revisions involved alterations to the design concept. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 18-10-2021."
