    "The cumulative impact of the hip to gable roof alteration, rear dormer window and the first floor rear extension would be out of scale, be disproportionately large, overly prominent and relate unacceptably to the existing dwelling with a top heavy appearance which would unbalance the appearance of this semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Preparation for Re-submission Informative",
    "There are variances between the proposed side elevations and proposed floor plans in respect to the steps going into garden. Greater clarity is needed on the re-submission and any potential mitigation to prevent a loss of privacy due to their position close of the boundaries of the site and projection forward of the neighbouring rear extensions.",
