    "The proposed development would by reason of its site coverage and proximity to shared boundaries, create a cramped form of development that would result in a dominant and visually intrusive feature to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal would also create inadequate aspect and outlook from habitable rooms, amenity space would be of poor quality and not private due to lack of separation between units, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of prospective future occupants contrary to Policy DC 61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies, Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 and 26 of the  Emerging Havering Local Plan (2016-2031).",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,925  based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of  £14,625 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
