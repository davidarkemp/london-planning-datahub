    "The proposed development would by virtue of their design, scale and mass lack subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and front street scene contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extensions would, by reason of its excessive scale, height and bulk and location on the boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and loss of sunlight and be harmful to the amenity of No. 7 Benhurst Avenue contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Ian Coward via email on 29/10/19."
