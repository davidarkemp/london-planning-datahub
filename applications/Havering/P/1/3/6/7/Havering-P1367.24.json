    "The application does not provide sufficient information to satisfy the Council, that the development has not significantly, adversely affected and damaged the biodiversity of the habitat of the site and it is considered that the provision of the proposed car parking spaces on the back garden as well as the land covered by the trees until recently and the area where the proposed detached garage is to be located would have the potential of having a significant impact upon the ecological and biodiversity of the site. In these regards the proposal is contrary to policies 26 (Urban design), Policy 27 (Landscaping), Policy 30 (Biodiversity and geodiversity), and the advice in National Planning Policy Framework 2024, which seek minimising impacts on and providing net gains for biodiversity.",
    "It would appear from the drawings that due to the boundary constraints, there would not be sufficient space for a car to manoeuvre in and out of the proposed garage. The proposal would therefore be likely to disrupt the manoeuvring of the cars in the accessway, resulting in adverse impact upon safe and free flow of traffic in the service road, contrary to policy 23 of the Local Plan (2021) and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework 2024.",
