  "decision_conditions": [
    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed development would due to the constraints of the site, the layout and design approach result in habitable rooms having inadequate light, poor outlook,",
    "aspect and ventilation which would give rise to substandard levels of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the prospective occupiers, in direct contrast to the aims and objectives of the London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards restriction on ability to obtain parking permits the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, the proposal would be contrary to the provisions of Policy 24 of the Local Plan 2021 and Policy T6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for both the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering Council's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) . Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be a total Â£35,100.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking further amendments after various amendments have been made at various stage of the application, but given conflict with the adopted planning policy, and the reasons for refusal have already been highlighted as concerns at the initial stage of the application. As application was submitted with no pre-application consultation with officers, it was necessary to issue a decision to avoid further delay."
