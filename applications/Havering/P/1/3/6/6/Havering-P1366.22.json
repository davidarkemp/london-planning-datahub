    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of the previous additions to the host dwelling, cumulatively is considered excessive and unsympathetic and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and fail to conserve or enhance the surrounding Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposals are contrary to Local Plan policies 26 and 28; London Plan (2021) policy HC1 and paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed front boundary wall, by reason of its overall expanse and materials would be detrimental to the open and verdant character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area.  It would also unacceptably enclose the front garden and appear dominant and visually intrusive in the streetscene. As such the development would fail to preserve the character or appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The development would conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 26 and 28 and the objectives of the NPPF. The development also fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Gidea Park Conservation Area, therefore contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",

    "In case of a re submission, the applicant is informed to provide details of materials to be utilised for the re-configuration of the front garden. Also, trees were not indicated in the application form nor shown on plan. These should be identified on the application form and also on plan."
