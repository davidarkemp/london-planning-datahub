  "status": "Approved",
  "decision_target_date": "09/12/2019",
  "site_name": "270 Hornchurch Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC33.",
    "The development shall be constructed strictly in accordance with those details approved under application Q0236.19 unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Prior to the occupation of the building the applicant shall provide, to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority 8No. cycle parking spaces (one of which shall be long-stay cycle parking).  Short-stay cycle parking spaces should have step-free access and be located within 15m of the main store entrance.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Cycle parking spaces are to be provided in accordance with Policy 6.9 of the London Plan (Table 6.3) to promote sustainable travel by customers and staff.",
    "Landscaping shall be implemented in accordance with details submitted and approved under application Q0225.19. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised of the approved scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, the premises shall only be used for the sale of bulky goods (i.e. goods of a large physical nature that usually require large areas for storage and display) which are furniture, carpets, DIY, electrical goods and garden items and for no other purpose or use, including the sale of food or groceries, or any other purpose within Class (A1) of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) or any provision equivalent to that Class in any Statutory Instrument revoking and/or re-enacting that Order.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure that the development does not adversely affect the vitality and viability of existing town centres and to accord with the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "a) If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b) Following completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the A1 unit hereby permitted a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to achieve the following standard - Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive property shall not exceed LA90 -10dB. Plant and machinery shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to assess the noise levels of any plant or machinery to be used on site. Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use, will prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties in accordance with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC55 and DC61.",
    "Commercial vehicle deliveries to and collections from the retail unit hereby approved shall not occur outside the following times:",
    "08.00-18.00 Monday to Saturday",
    "09.00-17.00 Sundays, Bank and Public Holidays",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the amenity of nearby residents and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraphs 186-187 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £8,625",
    "As of September 1st 2019 the proposals would also be liable for Havering CIL. This would translate to a payment of £60,375 at a rate of £175 per square metre."
