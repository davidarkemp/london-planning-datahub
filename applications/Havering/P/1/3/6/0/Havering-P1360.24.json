    "The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space of 70.5 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan. The proposal has an adverse impact on the supply of family housing within the Borough, the loss of which is not adequately justified and which could set an undesirable precedent for similar development in the locality.",
    "The poor layout of the site creates conditions that result in undue overlooking and loss of privacy to Bedroom 1 on the ground floor of the HMO, which provides a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of existing occupiers contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The HMO for five occupants results in an intensification of the site and results in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity, contrary to Policies 7, 8 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to MEK Town Planning and Design via email on 10th January 2025."
