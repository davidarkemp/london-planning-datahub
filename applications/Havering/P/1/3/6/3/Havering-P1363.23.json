    "The proposed development would, by reason of a combination of the quantum of development, design, bulk and mass of the extensions, the lack of and inadequacy of the amenity areas, overprovision of car parking spaces, absence of acceptable access, cycle parking and refuse storage arrangements, give rise to an unacceptable overdevelopment of the site, harmful to the character of the surrounding area and the amenity of future occupiers of the development, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and the Local Plan Policy 26.",
    "The proposed side extension to Block A would, by reason of its bulk, mass, excessive width and design, together with the roof alterations, appear as an incongruous and disproportionate addition to the existing building, harmful to the existing characater and appearance of the existing buildings and the pattern of development in the wider streetscene, as well as intrusive and overbearing in relation to no. 2 Douglas Avenue owing to the height of the side extension and proximity to the shared boundary, contrary to the aims of the Local Plan Policy 7 and 26.",
    "The proposed development would due to the constraints of the site in conjunction with the quantum of development and the design approach result in habitable rooms immediately adjacent to the proposed rear car park having inadequate outlook and poor aspect,  in particular units within Blocks B and D of the development, as well as the development resulting in significant reduction in the existing communal amenity space. The proposal would also fail to make adequate provision of quality private amenity space for future occupiers of the development.  The proposal would therefore give rise to substandard levels of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the existing and prospective occupiers, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the lack of adequate provision of family sized homes within the development, and the failure to robustly demonstrate justification for this lack of provision and departure from the Council's housing mix requirements, is contrary to the requirements of Policy 5 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be  £14,150 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £70,750 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
