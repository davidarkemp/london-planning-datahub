    "The proposed development fails to justify the demolition of the existing building on the site and would, by reason of its design, scale, bulk, mass and position close to the boundaries of the site, with particular reference to its excessive width and detailed design, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and Policy D4 (delivering good design) of adopted London Plan 2021 and the National Planning Policy Framework, which  aim to achieve high standards of design.",
    "The proposed development, due to the provision of poor private quality private amenity space for the ground floor units and the poor quality outlook and balcony provision for flat 6, result in the provision of substandard residential accommodation detrimental to the amenity of prospective occupiers of the flats. Accordingly, there would be conflict with Policy 7  of the Local Plan and the Residential Design Guide SPD which seek, amongst other things, to ensure development achieves a high standard of amenity. There would also be conflict with paragraph 130 of the Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "The proposed housing mix is contrary to the requirements of Policy 5 of the Havering Local Plan, particularly with regard to the shortfall of 3 bed units within the development.  In the absence of any reasoned justification of the housing mix proposed the proposal fails to demonstrate an acceptable provision of family sized homes, contrary to Policy 5 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal may have detrimental impacts on trees adjoining the application site, which have a contribution to the visual amenity of the locality.  In the absence of an arboricultural report or of measures demonstrating how the developer will prevent an adverse impact on the trees, the Local Planning Authority cannot be satisfied that the development will not result in significant harm to or loss of the trees, contrary to Policy  27 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and the policy advice in National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant on 17/11/2023.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £6,752 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £33,750 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
