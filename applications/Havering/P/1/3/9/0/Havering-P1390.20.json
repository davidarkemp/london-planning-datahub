It would also reduce the characteristic visual gap between the dwellings which would be an unacceptable visually intrusive feature in the street scene, harmful to the appearance and character of the host property and surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the to advice set out in the Residential Extension and Alteration Supplementary Design Guidance adopted 2011.",
