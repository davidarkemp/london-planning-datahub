    "The proposed extraction flue fails to discharge 1m above the eaves of the main building and insufficient information has been provided with the current submission to judge the appropriateness of the extraction flue proposed to serve the kitchen within in the proposed extension. Given the lack of technical information and in view of the close proximity of the site to neighbouring residential development, it cannot be concluded that the proposals would not result in harm to amenity and the proposal is therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7, 26 and 34 as well as the Framework which at Para 130f requires, amongst other considerations, that development ensures a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
