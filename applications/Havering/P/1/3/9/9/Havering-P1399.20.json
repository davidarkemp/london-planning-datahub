  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear/side extension, change to front porch, extension of first floor involving conversion of roof from hip to gable, front dormer window and front roof light, garage conversion to a habitable space",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, bulk and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of the attached neighbour at no. 149 Warren Drive, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposed development of the hip to gable loft conversion and large front dormer would result in the unbalancing of the semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene that would be out of character and harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development of the two storey rear extension would by reason of it having an excessive depth and width with a flat roof, appear as an unacceptably dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden scene that would be out of character and harmful to the appearance of the semi-detached pair and the surrounding area contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to Mr Steve Walker (agent), via email on 23 December 2020."
