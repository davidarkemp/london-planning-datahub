    "The window and door arrangement within the unauthorised garage conversion due to its lack of uniformity and symmetry with the main dwelling and the attached neighbour would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive which would unbalance the appearance of the semi-detached pair and therefore be harmful to the street scene and the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 26, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area and maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "The development (unauthorised garage conversion), by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision or demonstration to indicate otherwise, would result in an unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads and in the absence of a swept path analysis/tracking plans, the siting and proximity of the car parking space but also the extension to the existing crossover would result in inadequate access and egress arrangements to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
