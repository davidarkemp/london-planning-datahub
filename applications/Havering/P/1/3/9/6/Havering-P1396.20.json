  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear dormer would, by reason of its position, design, bulk and mass appear out of scale and character with the existing nature of the host property, terraced dwellings and neighbouring properties within the development. Also the proposal would be materially harmful to the visual amenity of nearby residents due to the close proximity of the dormer to adjoining rear gardens which would have an overbearing impact on their amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
