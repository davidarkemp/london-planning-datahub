    "The existing development by reason of its scale, length, height, non-permeable walls and fencing material",
    "and position close to the boundary form an unacceptably  dominant and visually intrusive feature, harmful to the appearance of the street scene and detracting from the open character of the surrounding area, contrary to the Landscape and Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Documents and Policy DC61 of LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Plan Document.",
    "The proposals fail to demonstrate adequate screening to be maintained on the site, given that the existing shrubs planted are not within the redline area of the site, therefore the retention of the plants is reliant on the availability of the adjoining parcel of land which is currently under the ownership of the London Borough of Havering. Accordingly the proposal is unacceptable in terms of its visual impact and impact on openness which is in conflict with the provisions of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, London Plan policy G2 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "The proposed change of use of the agricultural land is required given that the red line area of the prior approval proposals allowed on appeal under ref: APP/B5480/W/14/3001465 does not include the current application site, therefore a separate planning application for a change of use is required.",
