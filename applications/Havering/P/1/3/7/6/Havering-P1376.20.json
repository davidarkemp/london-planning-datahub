  "description": "Erection of two storey detached dwelling with associated parking and amenity space to rear of existing property.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, and its cramped setting within the plot, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and owing to its scale, siting and arrangement of amenity space provision be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in the locality, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties be intrusive and overbearing within the adjacent rear garden environment as well as causing overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the siting of the development in such close proximity to the rear boundary of the site, would appear overly cramped and would result in the ground floor habitable room windows to the rear of the property sited less than 1.5m from the rear fenceline, giving rise to a poor level of light and outlook to the ground floor of the proposed dwelling, which is to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers, contrary to the provisions of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 25 November 2020.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,200 and the Havering CIL payable would be £11,000. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
