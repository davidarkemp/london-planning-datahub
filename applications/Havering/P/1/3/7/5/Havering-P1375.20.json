  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, in particular the two storey side extension would by virtue of its scale and the incompatible and insubordinate design of the flat roof element appear as an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development, which is harmful to the character and appearance of the streetscene, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, siting, position and its relationship close to the neighbouring boundary of the site, be unneighbourly which would give rise to loss of light; loss of outlook resulting in an uncomfortable overbearing effect and an increased sense of enclosure; harmful to the amenity of No. 18 Bowden Drive contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent Mr Andrei Nazarov by e-mail on 19/11/2020."
