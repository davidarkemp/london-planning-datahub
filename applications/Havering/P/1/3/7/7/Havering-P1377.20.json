    "The second floor side extension would, by reason of its crown roof form, mass and siting, combined with the existing extensions to the property, would not satisfactorily integrate with host building, thereby it would compromise the architectural composition of the building and hence it is considered to be harmful to the character and appearance of the streetscene contrary to Policies CP18, DC61 and DC68 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
