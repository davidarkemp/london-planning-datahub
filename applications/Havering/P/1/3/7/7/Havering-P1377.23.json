    "The proposed development would, by reasons of its scale, mass, roof design and external appearance appear as an unacceptably dominant, overbearing, incongruous and visually intrusive feature within the streetscene and the area, more generally be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the surrounding area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £ 1,400.00 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £7,000.00 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
