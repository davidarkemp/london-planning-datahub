    "The proposal results in the loss of a family house, for which there is a significant need in the Borough. The original dwelling has a gross internal floor space of approximately 84 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The communal outdoor amenity space is insufficient and poor quality given its limited depth and size for an HMO of up to nine occupants, which would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Bedroom 4 has a gross internal area of 8.36 square metres, which fails to meet the gross internal floor space of 8.5 square metres for one occupier and Bedroom 5 has a gross internal area of 11.68 square metres, which fails to meet the gross internal floor space of 13 square metres for two occupiers, which would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 8 of the Havering Local Plan and the HMO East London Guidance.",
    "The proposal would result in an intensification of the site and result in significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity, contrary to Policies 7 and 8 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed layout and the siting and proximity of the two car parking spaces to the residents parking bay in front of this property and to the boundaries of the frontage of the site, is likely to impede pedestrian access to this property, result in a cramped layout with inadequate and impractical access and egress arrangements and is likely to result in the encroachment of the public highway harmful to highway and pedestrian safety and the amenity of future occupiers. In addition, two parking spaces for up to nine occupants of the proposed HMO is likely to result in increased parking congestion in Queens Park Road and in surrounding streets. The proposal is contrary to Policies 8, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies T4 and T6.1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Alpha Studios via email on 17th November 2023."
