    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Plan, as well as the London Plan and the Guidance Given in the National Planning Policy Framework emphasise that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The special circumstances which have been submitted in this case are not considered to outweigh the harm of the inappropriate development. The proposal is therefore contrary to the Local Plan (2021), London Plan (2021) and the advice given in the NPPF (2021) .",
    "The proposed development would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the green belt by adding  a permanent structure of substantial footprint and bulk, which is generally open introducing forms of development which would be detrimental to the openness. The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk and massing, result in unsympathetic development which would not preserve the open character of the area. The proposal is therefore would be contrary to the Guidance Given in Charpter 16 of the NPPF, Policies 26, 27 and 28 of the Local Plan, and the provisions of the London Plan",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent on 20th October 2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £6300, based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
