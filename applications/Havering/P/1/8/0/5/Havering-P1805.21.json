However, the building has been built without complying with the pre-commencement condition (2) being discharged and the building has been built contrary to the detailed approved for the conversion of the existing building under the prior approval scheme J0008.20.  As such, the development is considered unlawful by virtue of Article 3(5)a of the General Permitted Development Order. Hence, the application is considered invalid and the amendments sought cannot be considered further."
