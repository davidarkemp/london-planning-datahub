  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt and the North Ockendon Conservation Area.  The proposals by reasons of its scale, mass, height and location resulting in full width extension across the site closing the only existing gap to the rear view of site, would be detrimental to the character and appearance  of the host property which is a semi-detached dwelling set within spacious plots. The proposals would add to the extensive extensions on site, which would be significantly harmful to the  character and appearance of the Green Belt and Conservation Area. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case, the proposal is therefore considered to be an inappropriate development in Green Belt area, contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, as well as t",
    "The proposed side extension including the front and side extensions to the existing garage would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached dwellings and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene harmful to the appearance of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
