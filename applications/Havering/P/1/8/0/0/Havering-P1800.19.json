    "The proposal development would by reason of the overall bulk, mass, scale and design on the boundary with the public highway, would appear overbearing in the street-scene and it would also result in unbalancing of the symmetrical aspect of the semi-detached pair, thereby causing visual harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were sought with the agent Brendon Robins (agent). However, the agent and applicant were not inclined to make any changes."
