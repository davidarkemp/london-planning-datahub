    "The proposed development would through the limited size of the site result in a cramped plot, at odds with prevailing plot sizes and cramped form of development which would failt to reflect existing patterns of development. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which amongst other considerations requires development add to the overall quality of an area and be sympathetic to local character.",
    "The proposals would fail to make adquate provision for off-street  parking and would result in the loss of off-street parking for the donor property. This would in the asbence of any evidence otherwise contribute to existing demand for on-street parking where there are levels of existing parking stress. It has not therefore been demonstrated that there would not be a material impact on the functioning of the highway or that the cumulative impacts would not be severe. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 23 and 24 which seek amongst other things to ensure adequate parking provision is made and that no unacceptable impacts on highway safety would occur. Further to this there would be conflict with Para 115 of the NPPF in the absence of any evidence otherwise.",
    "The limited plot depth, separation from shared boundaries would mean that outlook to the rear from inside and outside spaces at ground floor level and within the amenity space would be poor. As such the proposals do not comply with the objectives of London Plan Policy D6, Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7 and the Framework, specifically Para 135 which requires that development provide a high standard of amenity for future users.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 08-02-2024.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1,750  based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £8,750 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
