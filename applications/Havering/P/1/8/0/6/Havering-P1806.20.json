  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey side extension, first floor rear extension and addition of front porch",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear and side extension would, by reason of its unrelated roof form and design respectively, and failing to incorporate a set back from the main building line and a set down at roof level, would unacceptably unbalance this pair of semi-detached properties and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden and street scene, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its position close to the shared boundary, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and have an adverse effect on the amenity of adjacent occupiers at No. 89 Heath Park Road, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and  Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Zaavia Design by e-mail on 22/02/21.",
    "It should be noted that there is a discrepancy between the proposed drawings submitted for this application. Specifically, a small flat roof area shown on the proposed roof drawing is not illustrated on the proposed side elevation drawings."
