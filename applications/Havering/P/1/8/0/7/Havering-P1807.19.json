    "The proposed development by reason of the additional scale, bulk and mass of the additions proposed, the proximity to the plot boundary and the prominent corner location would result in a cramped form of development on the site, out of character with the locality and to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the number of units proposed, internal arrangement and provision of amenity space would contribute to an environment which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupants in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed car parking layout is deigned in such a manor which would not allow the cars to manoeuvre within the site in order to enter and egress the site in a forward gear fashion. The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate sightline and insufficient on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and the free flow of traffic contrary to Policy DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The development would create an uplift in occupancy which would be out of keeping with the surrounding suburban context. This would present in increased comings and goings to the site which would be over and above what could be regarded as acceptable and would be detrimental to local character and the amenity of adjoining and nearby occupiers. This is evident in particular in the arrangement of vehicle parking to the site frontage and the close proximity to habitable rooms of the adjoining premises. The development would then be both detrimental to local character and the amenity of nearby occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Amendments were sought by staff which addressed issues with parking, however it was not considered that the above reasons for refusal were capable of being overcome. Consideration was given to seeking fruther amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 17-02-2020.",
    "Please note also that should permission be granted, from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £32,800 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development. Based upon calculations undertaken by the case officer and information supplied with the application your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £5,475 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 2"
