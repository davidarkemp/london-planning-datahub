    "Non-compliance with SBD principles in the absence of any evidence otherwise would present a risk to future occupiers which would outweigh the benefits of providing the accommodation. The proposals are therefore in conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 6 which amongst other considerations requires that specialist accommodation is suitable for the intended occupants. Furthermore there would be conflict with the objectives of London Plan Policy  H12 and the NPPF which specifically at Para 135 requires that development create places that are safe, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users and where crime and disorder, and the fear of crime, do not undermine the quality of life or community cohesion and resilience.",
