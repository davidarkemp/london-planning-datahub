    "In the absence of details to demonstrate otherwise, the proposals would result in the loss of ability to service the site from the rear and the loss of ancillary external refuse and outdoor storage space detrimental to the future function of this commercial unit within the Local Centre. The proposals would also result in the introduction of a noise sensitive use at ground floor level that fails to reflect the Agent of Change principle and would impact on the adjoining commercial uses to the detriment of the future viability and function of the Local Centre contrary to London Plan policies E9, SD7 and D13 and Local Plan policy 13.",
    "The proposals would provide substandard residential accommodation which would be to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. This is due to inadequate floor to ceiling heights, poor levels of outlook and daylight within and failure to demonstrate provision of dual aspect accommodation and to mitigate the impacts from existing noise and other nuisance-generating activities on the proposed new noise-sensitive residential development contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D6 and D13 Local Plan policy 7.",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or a section 106 agreement to secure appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the controlled parking zone, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surround highway network contrary to Local Plan Policy 24.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 26/11/21.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the proposed development will create 1 new residential unit with 37sqm of new gross internal floorspace. The proposal is liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £4,625 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £925 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
