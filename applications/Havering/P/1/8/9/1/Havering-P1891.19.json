  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwellings would appear as an incongruous form of development within the rear garden environment, entirely out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of development therefore harmful to local character and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation including amenity space would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure with poor outlook and access to sunlight, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would compromise the scheme at No 307 St Mary's Lane under reference P0911.19 such that the scheme could not be completed in line with the approved plans. The amenity space for this development would be harmfully constrained through these proposals  to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers contrary to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via telephone.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £10,065. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Mayoral CIL is charged at a rate of £25.00 per square metre which would would incur a liability of £1,677.50 based on a gross internal area of 67.1sqm.",
    "Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) is charged at an approved rate of £125/sqm of gross internal area (GIA), therefore would generate a liability of £8,387.50."
