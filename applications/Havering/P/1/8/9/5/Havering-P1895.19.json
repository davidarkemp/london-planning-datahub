  "description": "Subdivision of the site and construction of a single storey, 2-bed, detached dwelling.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of it being sunken below ground level, having an internal gross floor area less than the minimum space standards for new residential dwellings, lack of adequate outlook, lack of adequate access to sunlight/daylight and close proximity to the boundaries, would result in a poor living environment and a cramped overdevelopment of the site at the detriment of future occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed new dwelling goes against the prevailing pattern of development of the surrounding area and would result in an out of character feature within the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of occupiers of neighbouring residential properties, contrary to policy DC61.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the poorly designed amenity space, not constitute a sustainable development and would be at the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the total CIL payable would be Â£7950. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Ray Reilly (agent) via email on 25 March 2020."
