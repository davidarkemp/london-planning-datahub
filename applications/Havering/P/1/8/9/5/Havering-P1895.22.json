    "The cumulative impact of the first floor side extension and hip to gable roof alteration would be out of scale, disproportionately large, overly prominent and relate unacceptably to the existing dwelling, resulting in a top heavy appearance that would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk and mass, would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden scene, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension, would by reason of its height, scale, bulk and proximity to the neighbouring property no. 118 Beauly Way, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £17,550 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposals are subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £17,550 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 117 square metres.",
    "You are advised to visit the planning port",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via e-mail on 17-01-23."
