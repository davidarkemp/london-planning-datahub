    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of amenity space and insufficient unit size, result in a cramped over-development of the site and fail to provide high quality private amenity space to the detriment of future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan (2021) policy D6.",
    "The proposed mansard and its associated dormers would, by reason of its detailed design, scale, bulk, mass and height appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and particularly harmful to the character and appearance of the Romford Conservation Area, contrary to Local Plan Policies 26 and 28, London Plan (2021) policies D4 and HC1 and paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "In the absence of a Unilateral Undertaking or a section 106 agreement to secure appropriate mitigation by restricting future occupiers of the development from obtaining parking permits within the controlled parking zone, the proposed development would likely exacerbate existing parking stress and congestion on the surround highway network contrary to Local Plan Policy 24.",
    "In the absence of robust evidence to demonstrate otherwise; the proposals would fail to provide the Councils recommended housing mix including family-sized accommodation, contrary to Local Plan policy 5.",
    "The proposed cycle storage and its access arrangements fail to demonstrate the provision of adequate and accessible cycle storage which is of a design that would meets the needs of future occupiers and would discourage the use of sustainable modes of transport contrary to Local Plan policy 23 and London Plan (2021) policy T5.",
    "In the absence of plans showing the flats below and a daylight and sunlight assessment to demonstrate that the existing flats beneath the proposed mansard level would still receive acceptable levels of daylight within their internal rooms as a result of their existing rooflights being removed to accommodate the development, the proposal would have an adverse impact on the amenity of existing occupiers. The proposals are therefore contrary to Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application,the proposed development will create 2 new residential units with 89sqm of new gross internal floorspace. The proposal is liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £11,125 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.00 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £2,225 (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
