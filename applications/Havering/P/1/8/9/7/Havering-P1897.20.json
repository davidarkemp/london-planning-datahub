  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its site constraints and design approach including the site coverage and quantum of development, resulting in an overdevelopment, cramped layout, compromised outlook, loss of privacy to the shallow north-facing front amenity spaces, creation of poor non-functional and enclosed private amenity spaces for units 2, 4,5 and 6, and proximity of units with some habitable room windows to the boundaries of the site, give rise to an unsatisfactory relationship between the proposed block and the site boundaries and leading to a substandard and poor quality of living accommodation environment, as well as a harmful relationship with the adjacent servicing road, to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its failure to provide a safe dedicated pedestrian and cyclist access to the site, coupled with the poor quality of visibility from Carlton Road to the site and poor layout, would result in an overly cramped development to the detriment of highway safety and the residential amenity of future occupiers. The development would be contrary to Policies DC32, DC34 & DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal, having regard to the narrow in/out access roads, is able to make adequate provision for the servicing of the site, including adequate provision for refuse collection and access arrangements for emergency and rescue vehicles,  resulting in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Policy DC36 of the LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its scale and sitting would result in an overdominant, discordant and unduly prominent form of development that fails to respect the established pattern of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area contrary to Policies Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Development Plan Document and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for both the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering Council's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) . Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be a total £79,350.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, and the reasons for refusal have already been highlighted as concerns at pre-application stage,  it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
