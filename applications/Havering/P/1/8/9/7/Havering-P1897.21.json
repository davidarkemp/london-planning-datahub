    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until samples of all materials to be used in the external construction of the building(s) are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "No above ground works in connection with the approved scheme shall take place until there has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping,  All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping proposed as well as methods of protecting existing species on site and in surrounding sites.  Submission of a scheme prior to commencement will ensure that the development accords with Polices 7, 26 and 27 of t",

    "b)  storage of plant and materials;",
    "c)  dust management controls;",
    "d)  measures for minimising the impact of noise and ,if appropriate, vibration arising from construction activities;",
    "e)  predicted noise and, if appropriate, vibration levels for construction using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authority;",
    "f)  scheme for monitoring noise and if appropriate, vibration levels using methodologies and at points agreed with the Local Planning Authorities;",
    "g)  siting and design of temporary buildings;",
    "h)  scheme for security fencing/hoardings, depicting a readily vis",
    "Before the building hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for parking for the dwellings hereby permitted shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority as indicated on drawing no. 002(A) and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose. Furthermore the access must remain free from obstruction at all times.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with Policy 24 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",

This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the sites ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",
    "c) A Phase III (Remediation Strategy) Report if the Phase II Report confirms the presence of a significant pollutant linkage requiring remediation.  A detailed remediation scheme to bring the site to",
    "a) If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b) Following completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained. Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the Local Planning Authority to verify boiler emissions.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details set out on the Arboricultural Report and Impact Assessment and as per drawing no. RS/FAR/01, hereby approved. These measures shall be implemented before development commences and kept in place until the approved development is completed.",
    "Reason:-  In order that the preserved trees on site and in the vicinity of the site will be adequately protected during construction.",
    "The proposed development would create a new floor area equivalent to  110sqm new gross internal floor space. The proposal is therefore liable for Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) and would incur a charge of £2,750 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
    "In addition the development would be liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) which was adopted on September 1st 2019. In this location it translates to a charge of £125 per sqm of new floor space. This equates to a charge of £13,750.",
    "Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing and on phone. The revisions involved reduction in depth at the first floor level, reduction in the overall width of the proposal; internal layout alterations to provide at least one double bedroom and the submission of a full Tree Survey. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 20-12-2021 and 21/12/2021.",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during construction works then they will need to apply for a license from the Council. If the developer requires scaffolding, hoarding or mobile cranes to be used on the highway, a license is required and Streetcare should be contacted on 01708434343 to make the necessary arrangements.",
    "Please note that unauthorised works on the highway is an offence.",
    "The granting of planning permission does not discharge the applicant from responsibilities under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 the contravention of which is a criminal offence.",
    "Precautionary advice for birds",
    "Birds are legally protected during the breeding season and need to be considered in respect of any impact from the proposed work. Work involving vegetation clearance must take place outside the optimum breeding season (March to August inclusive), unless it can be confirmed there are no breeding birds in the proposed work area. Note that birds frequently nest outside of the optimum period, particularly during spells of milder weather. It should never be assumed work can always take place without prior investigation.",
    "Birds generally tend to nest in dense shrub beds and mature trees. Where such vegetation may be affected by the proposed work it will require inspection for nesting birds. For example, but not exclusively, blackbird, dunnock, robin, blue and great tit, pigeons, magpies and crows.",
    "When reinstating vegetation and hardstand following building, install permeable surfaces, water butts and rain gardens. Plant a diverse mix of trees, shrubs and her",
    "The proposal involves works which affect the highway and/or its verge.  Before commencing such works you must obtain separate consent of the Highway Authority.  Please contact the Streetcare on 01708 432563."
