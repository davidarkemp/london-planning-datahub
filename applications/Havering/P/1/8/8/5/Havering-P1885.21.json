    "The proposed extensions would, by reason of its detailed design, excessive scale, bulk, height, massing and position close to the boundaries of the site, would overwhelm and unacceptably dominate the host dwelling, its semi-detached pair of No. 89 and the adjoining row of semi-detached properties. It would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and would result in an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the visual amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Local Plan policies 7 and 26.",
