    "The proposed flats would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation, due to inadequate internal floorspace provision, poor level of outlook for the occupiers at flat 1, noise impacts and no provision of private or communal space and would in the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise receive unacceptable levels of daylight within flat 1, which would significantly impact on the living conditions of future occupiers. The proposals are contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and London Plan policy D6. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
    "The location of the entrance to the upper floor flats would be shared with the servicing and delivering area of the commercial use at the ground floor level, creating conflict between the two uses and may result in noise impacts to these flats which may place unreasonable restrictions on the use and impact on the future viability of the commercial unit and the town centre. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated that the scheme has been designed in a sensitive way to protect new residential occupiers from noise and other nuisances contrary to Local Plan Policy 7, 13 and London Plan policies D6, D13 and D14.",
    "In the absence of sufficient information it has not been demonstrated that the proposed dwellings would be served by an adequate and safe, inclusive access to meet the needs of future occupiers or achieve a minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of their Gross Internal Area and would therefore fail to provide a good standard of accommodation for future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policies 7, 10 and 26, London Plan policies D5, D6 and D11 and paragraph 110(b) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to restrict the eligibility of future occupiers of the flats for on-street residential parking permits. The development would fail to reduce car dominance and fail to promote sustainable development contrary to Local Plan policies 23 and 24 and London Plan (2021) policies T2, T6 and T6.1.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that adequate refuse and recycling provision and cycle storage could feasibly be accommodated on-site and has not clearly identified or explained how servicing the proposed flats would integrate with the existing servicing arrangements for the ground floor commercial units. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Local Plan policies 23 and 35 and London Plan (2021) policies T2, T4 and T5.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
