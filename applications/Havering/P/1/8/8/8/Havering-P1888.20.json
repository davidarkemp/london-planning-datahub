    "The proposed dwelling through the incongruous arrangement of fenestration would appear visually at odds with the existing terraced row and appear harmful to local character. In conjunction with the intrusive impact of boundary treatment to frame the site, which is inconsistent with that to be found in the vicinity of the site, would materially change the appearance of the scheme previously considered. These departures are considered to translate to material harm to the street-scene and local character and the development is thereby contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character.",
