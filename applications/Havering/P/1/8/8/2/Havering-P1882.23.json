    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under materials section of the application form and as stated on the approved plans unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The slatted design fence which would be fully solid without gaps shall be provided on either side in accordance with drawing numbers 01012022_28ST_9_5 REV_MAR 2024 & 01012022_28ST_11_5 REV_MAR 2024 within the rear garden. The fencing shall be permanently retained and maintained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed ground floor flank windows as shown on drawings 01012022_28ST_9_5 REV_MAR 2024 and  01012022_28ST_11_5 REV_MAR 2024 shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and  permanently fixed shut and thereafter maintained, with the exception of any top hung fanlight(s). Any open-able part of these windows shall be 1.7m above the finished floor level in the room which they are installed, as indicated on the proposed plans.",
