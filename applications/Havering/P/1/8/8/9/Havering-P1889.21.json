    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",

    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 8 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The roof-lights hereby approved shall not project more than 15cm beyond the plane of the existing roof.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure the proposal would have an acceptable impact upon the visual appearance of the building",

    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
