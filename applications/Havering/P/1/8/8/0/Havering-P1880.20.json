    "Prior to the first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emission less than 40 mg/kwh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without he fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained. Following the installation emission certificate will need to be provided to the local planning authority to verify boiler emission.",
