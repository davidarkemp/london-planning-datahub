    "The proposed development would, by reason of its positioning, bulk and mass, appear cramped on the site, not be in keeping with the character and pattern of the development in area and is considered to form as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design and layout, including the tightly restricted parking arrangements and on site vehicle manoeuvring space, gives rise to poor quality development which would result in inadequate and inconvenient on site car parking provision for future residents and overspill on to the adjoining roads to the detriment of residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 6.13 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent via email on 29 January 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,075 and the Havering CIL payable would be £10,375.",
