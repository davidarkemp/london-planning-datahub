    "The proposed development would, by reason additional scale, bulk and mass of the additions appear as a cramped form of development and unacceptably dominant, oppressive and visually intrusive feature when viewed from the front streetscene, nearby gardens and dwellings and be detrimental to visual amenity and to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policy 26.",
    "The proposed development would result unacceptable overlooking (particularly to No.s 3 and 5 Prestwood Drive), loss of outlook (particularly from No. 6 Clitheroe Road and No.s 3 and 5 Prestwood Drive) and overshadowing the rear gardens of No's 3 and 5 Prestwood Drive to the detriment of the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the minimum gross internal floor area and storage requirement, resulting in poor standard of accommodation. Further in the absence of sufficient information it has not been demonstrated that the proposed dwelling would achieve the minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of their Gross Internal Area and therefore the proposal would provide substandard accommodation detrimental to amenities of the future occupiers of the site contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 16/02/23.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for LB Havering CIL and will incur a charge of £8,789  (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £125.76 per square metre. The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £1,747  (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
