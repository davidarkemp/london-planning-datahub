    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 11:00 and 20:00 Mondays to Fridays, 10:00 and 17:00 on Saturdays and 11:00 and 17:00 Sundays and Bank/Public Holidays, without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "An active window display shall be provided at maintained all times in the shop window fronting Brentwood Road.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of visual amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Within three months of the date of this decision notice details of a waste management scheme must be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how waste will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises, and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Developme",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraphs 186-187 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012."
