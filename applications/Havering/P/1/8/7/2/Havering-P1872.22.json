    "The proposed dwelling through its design, mass and site layout would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character and which, by reason of the height of the building on a cramped site and resuitant proximity to the dwelling at no. 202 Pettits Lane North appear intrusive and overbearing and result in harm to the amenity of the adjoining occupier.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7,10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the guidance within the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation resulting in poor aspect and outlook with the habitable room windows in close proximity of the neighbouring boundary with No.202 Pettits Lane North, would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure, in direct contrast to the aims of Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan and with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Amin by e-mail on 19-01-23.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
