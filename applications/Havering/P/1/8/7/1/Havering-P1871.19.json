  "description": "Erection of a 3 storey building to include 8 x 2-bed and 1 x 1-bed self-contained flats with associated parking and amenity space.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass and profile and lack of articulation appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character.",
    "The proposed development would fail to demonstrate an acceptable living environment for future occupants, through a combination of the lack of permeability and legibility of the development for future occupants and low quality amenity areas, factors which are conducive to a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 05-02-2020",
    "Accommodation in the roof would be reliant on windows in the flank wall. It is not good practice to obscurely glaze a primary room and this would be regarded as contributing to a poor quality of the living environment. As it is shown the proposals would increase overlooking and contribute to an unacceptable loss of privacy and perception of being overlooked contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL2). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £19,900. In addition the proposals would be liable for Havering CIL (HCIL) and the HCIL payable would be £99,500.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
