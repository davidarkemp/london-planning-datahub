    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, height and mass, and close proximity to neighbouring boundaries appear as an unacceptably dominant, oppressive and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, and in the rear gaden environment, resulting in harm to the amenity of adjoining occupiers as well as the  wider area and be harmful to visual amenity and detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policies 26 and 28.",
    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed development is judged likely to have an unacceptable impact on the daylight received within the rear rooms of No. 14 Nelmes Way and due to the close proximity to the boundary with this would overshadow its rear garden contrary to Local Plan Policy 7.",
    "In the absence of an arboricultural report to demonstrate otherwise, it has not been demonstrated if existing trees of value would be lost within the rear garden or that adequate replacement trees would be provided based on the existing value of the benefits of the trees to be removed to accommodate the development contrary to Local Plan policy 27 and London Plan policy G7.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 16/12/21.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £15,525 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £77,625 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
