    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and massing, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and rear garden envrionment detrimental to local character and prevailing patterns of development neither appropriating existing character or introducing positive new character. The proposed development would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan and the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, scale, siting and proximity to neighbouring properties result in a significant loss of outlook, an increased sense of enclosure and have an overbearing impact, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the NPPF, in particular Paragraph 130(f) which requires a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants.",
    "The proposed development would fail to demonstrate an acceptable living environment for future occupants, through shortfalls in prescribed standards for amenity space, factors which are conducive to a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and London Plan 2021 Policy D6. There would also be conflict with paragraph 130(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated satisfactorily that the car parking layout is sufficiently well arranged to be safe and convenient for existing and future occupants of the development and wider site. The reliance on an undercroft arrangment and cramped layout may be detrimental to the safety of other road users and pedestrians. As such the proposals do not make adequate provision for off-street parking and would be contrary to Policies 7, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and London Plan 2021 Policy T6.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 20-12-2021",
    "Contributions would be required under CIL regulations. The proposals, disregarding existing floor-space would result in a net increase of 271m².  In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "This proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £6,775 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £33,875.",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation."
