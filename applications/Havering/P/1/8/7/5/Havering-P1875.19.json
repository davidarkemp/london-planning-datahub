    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The first floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and relationship to the neighbouring dwelling be a dominant and overbearing feature which is an oppressive and unneighbourly form of development that would have an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.107 Laburnum Walk, Elm Park.  The development is therefore contrary to the Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Stubbles (Agent) by phone.  The revisions involved reducing the depth from 3.65m to 3m. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
