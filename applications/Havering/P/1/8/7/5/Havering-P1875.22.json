    "The proposed buildings through their design and mass, in particular roof form and relationship to shared boundaries would be visually dominant and overbearing when viewed from the street and surrounding sites. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation in all of the units proposed through lack of private amenity space, adequate natural light and outlook from inside and outside spaces which contributes to the development not being of sufficiently high quality contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7, London Plan Policy D6. There would also be conflict with Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The building fronting Heath Park Road in the absence of evidence otherwise would have an unacceptable impact on outlook and light received by the ground floor accommodation of the adjoining site. The building to the rear through its scale, bulk and mass and proximity to shared boundaries would present as an overbearing feature detrimental to outlook and in the absence of evidence otherwise would result in levels of overshadowing which would be harmful to amenity and enjoyment of this property. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7, 26 and 34. There would also be conflict with Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The units in the building fronting Heath Park Road fail to align with the requirements of Policy D7 of the London Plan and in the absence of justification otherwise through their prospective occupancy and scale would be required to do so. No justification has been given which amounts to grounds for refusal. The requirements of London Plan Policy D7 are reflected in Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 13-01-2023.",
