    "The proposed dwelling through its poor design, mass and site layout would form an isolated, incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character in an environment more familiar with subordinate outbuildings. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed dwelling would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature from the rear garden of 178 Suttons Avenue which would be detrimental to neighbouring amenity and therefore contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. There would also be conflict with paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 20-01-2023",
