  "description": "Retrospective application for conversion of first and second stories to 4 x 1 bed self-contained flats involving alterations to front and rear, including 2no. rear dormers and 4no. front roof lights.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development fails to meet the overall minimum floorspace standards and therefore gives rise to a sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers, as well as providing poor quality light and outlook to habitable rooms within the development. The development is therefore contrary to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of amenity space, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC4 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "The  rear dormer windows, by reason of their bulk and massing would occupy an unacceptably large area of the rear roof slope,  forming a dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature, detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "This is a retrospective application and whilst the application makes reference to an area for cycle and refuse stores to the rear of the site it is not clear that these would be practicable and workable for the future occupiers of the proposed development and for future servicing.  As the application fails to demonstrate suitable provision would be made for cycle storage or for the storage of refuse awaiting collection the development is judged to be unacceptable in this respect and contrary to the provisions of Policy DC35 and DC 36 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mark (agent) by email on 16/02/21."
