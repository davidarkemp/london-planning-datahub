    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its height, form, scale and mass, combined with the existing substantial extensions and the currently proposed single storey rear extension with its unsympathetic materials, lack subservience and appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive, with loss of original bay feature and detailing, harmful to the character and appearance of this non-designated heritage asset and the  streetscene and would fail to  preserve or enhance the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to Policies CP18, DC61 and DC68 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document and the NPPF.",
