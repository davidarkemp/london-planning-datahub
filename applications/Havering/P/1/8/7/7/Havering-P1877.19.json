    "The proposed extension by reason of its design would unacceptably compromise the original architectural composition of the building. In particular the proposed two storey rear extension would dominate the existing two storey bay to the rear which form the main feature in the rear elevation contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011, Hall Lane Policy Area SPD 2009 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
