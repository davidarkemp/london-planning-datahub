    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",

    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) the building hereby permitted shall be limited to an office use class E(g)(i) and shall be used for no other purpose(s) whatsoever including any other use in Class E of the Order, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application.",
    "The use of the building hereby permitted shall be limited to 8:30am to 9pm Mondays to Saturdays, and 9am to 7pm on Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To minimise the impact of the development on the surrounding area in the interests of amenity.",
    "This permission shall be for a limited period only expiring on 1st  January 2027 on or before which date the temporary building carried out under this permission shall be removed and the site reinstated to its former condition to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The temporary nature of the building(s) is such that permanent permission would not be appropriate in the interests of amenity.  This permission is therefore granted on a temporary basis to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control.",
    "The car parking spaces as shown on the drawings hereby approved shall only be used ancillary to and in connection with the existing use of the site for commercial purposes within Class E.",
    "Reason",
    "In the interest of highways safety and the amenities of adjoining premises.",
    "The portable cabin shall not be occupied until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "There shall be no floodlighting except in accordance with any details submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason",
    "In the interest of amenity",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
