  "decision_target_date": "13/03/2020",
  "site_name": "Land to rear of 4 Torrance Close",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal is an incongruous form of development within the rear garden environment, out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of development, therefore harmful to local character and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate access from a public road and does not have a legal vehicle access arrangement and would therefore result in a disorderly, unfunctional and unacceptable arrangement, contrary to Policy.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its siting in close proximity to an industrial use, result in a poor level of acoustic amenity for future occupiers contrary to Policy.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in email on 10/03/20.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £1930 and £9650. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
