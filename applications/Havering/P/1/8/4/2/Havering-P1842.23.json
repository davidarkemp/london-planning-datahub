    "The proposed dropped kerb would, by reason of its positioning result in the loss of a section of a pedestrian crossing along Straight Road. Given the close proximity in which the pedestrian crossing is located near the St Ursula's Catholic Primary School it would unacceptably increase the risk of hazards to highways safety that is to say the proposal would be likely to make the public highway a more dangerous environment than the existing highway arrangement contrary to Policies 7 and 23 of the Havering Local Plan.",
