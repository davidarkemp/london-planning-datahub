    "The proposed development through the arrangement of built form at the extremities and their massing would present as visually cramped through the limited separation from the shared boundaries of the site. This would be exacerbated by the two storey form of the buildings and in doing so the proposals would neither reflect existing local character and patterns of development, nor introduce positive new character. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which amongst other considerations requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposals through the cramped nature of the development and limited separation from shared boundaries would provide confined and enclosed private amenity areas within which outlook from internal and external spaces would be poor. Outlook from first floor windows would be directed at the flank walls of adjoining premises in some instances. These factors would would contribute to the development resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers and therefore contrary to the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7 and London Plan Policy D6. There would also be conflict with Paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The terraced row sited along the southern boundary of the site through lack of separation from shared boundaries to the side and rear in conjnunction with the massing proposed would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature from the adjoining sites. This would result in levels of overlooking and overshadowing which would be harmful to amenity and enjoyment of these properties. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7, 26 and 34. There would also be conflict with Paragraph 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 16-02-2024",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1950 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £9,750 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
