    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive width, depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers of the neighbouring resident at No.1 Garland Way, Hornchurch contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",

In addition, it would be beneficial for a proposed block plan being provided showing that two parking spaces, each dimensioned 4.8m long by 2.4m wide can be provided within the site, mindful of the loss of the garage as part of the proposal.",
