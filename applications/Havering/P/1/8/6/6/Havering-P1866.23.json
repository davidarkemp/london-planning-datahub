    "The two storey side extension would, by reason of its  height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities including outlook of adjacent neighbours at No.31 Park Drive, Romford contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed juliette balcony would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring property at No.31 Park Drive, Romford cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
