    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "The proposed glazing within the flank door of the utility room as shown on the submitted drawings RUD-1-001 REV C1 & RUD-1-002 REV C1 shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "The proposed ground floor flank window to the utility room and the first floor flank window serving the wet room as shown on drawings RUD-1-001 REV C1 & RUD-1-002 REV C1 shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and  permanently fixed shut and thereafter maintained, with the exception of any top hung fanlight(s).",
    "Reason:-",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Udennis (Agent) by e-mail. The revisions involved changing design of the first floor flank window to the wet room to incorporate a fanlight design. This was requested to protect the privacy of the adjacent neighbours. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 15/02/24."
