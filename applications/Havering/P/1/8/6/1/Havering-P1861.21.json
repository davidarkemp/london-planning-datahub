    "The proposed development would, by reason of its site coverage, quantum of development, layout, scale, bulk and massing result in a cramped and incongruous form of development, be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the surrounding area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and Policies 3, 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed units 1, 2 & 4 would fail to provide the required internal floor space, and the ground floor flats (Units 1 & 2) would have very poor outlook/aspect and would in the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise receive unacceptable levels of daylight. These units would fail to have adequate privacy buffer with the courtyard and future occupiers would rely on blinds/curtains to maintain privacy within, resulting in a dark oppressive living environment within these units, including all north facing balconies providing very poor private external amenity areas. The proposals would provide substandard level of accommodation that would adversely impact on the living conditions of future occupiers and would be contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan Policies D6.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide any family sized units and the proposed dwelling mix would therefore not comply with the Councils recommended dwelling mix. The proposals are therefore contrary to Local Plan Policy 5 and London Plan Policy H10.",
    "In the absence of detailed contextual elevations and a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise the proposed site coverage, scale, bulk and massing along the boundaries of nearby properties would be an unneighbourly, overbearing and an oppressive development which would adversely impact on the residential amenity of adjacent occupiers in terms of outlook and loss of daylight and sunlight to the upper floor windows and overshadowing of the rear gardens of adjoining neighbours, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policies D3 and D4.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 18-11-2021.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £3,400 at a rate of £25 per sqm (368m² x 25).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £17,000.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
