  "description": "New pitched roof to existing single storey side extension, single and two storey rear extensions and alterations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single and two storey rear extensions would, by reason of their excessive depth, scale, mass and form, lack subservience and appear overbearing to the principal building adversely effecting its architectural and archaeological interests by altering its overall form, the historic roofscape and losing all original windows to the rear and combined with a smooth finish render, would appear out of keeping, incongruous to its aesthetic value, dominant and visually intrusive, harmful to the character and appearance of this 1911 Exhibition property and would fail to  preserve or enhance the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to Policies CP18, DC61 and DC68 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document and the NPPF.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, scale, siting and position close to the boundaries of the site, be unneighbourly, appear overbearing and result in a significant loss of amenity to No. 28 Squirrels Heath Avenue, including loss of light, contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Architectural Design & Plan via email on 4th February 2021."
