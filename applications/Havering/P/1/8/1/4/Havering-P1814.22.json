    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to any above ground works samples of all materials to be used in the external construction of the building shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area..",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability and to ensure compliance with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 24",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Provision shall be made for the storage of commercial waste and general waste within the premises ahead of collection and at no time shall any waste in association with the business use hereby permitted be stored outside of the premises.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with Policies 26 and 35 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until there has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping proposed.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and in accordance with Policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The premises hereby permitted shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00 hours on Monday to Friday, 08:30 and 17:00 Saturday and not at all on Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "No deliveries or collections shall be dispatched or received from the site other than between the hours of 08:00 to 18:00 Monday to Saturday, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "No storage of plant, materials or any paraphernalia associated with the business uses hereby permitted shall take place in the open air and access to and from the site must be kept clear at all times.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to accord with Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Prior to the uses hereby permitted first commencing a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority to achieve the following standard: Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Subsequently should any use cease and change to any other specified within Condition 5, a further submission shall be made to the Local Planning Authority to address the provision of any new plant or machinery to facilitate the proposed use to meet the above standard, or whatever equivalent exists at that time, and thereafter shall be retained permanently and maintained to the Council's satisfaction. This process shall be replicated for any subsequent change of use occurring.",

The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b)         Following completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason:   To ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "No power tools or machinery shall be used on the premises other than portable hand tools unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
