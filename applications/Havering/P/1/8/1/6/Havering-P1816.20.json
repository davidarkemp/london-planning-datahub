  "description": "Part two storey, part single storey rear extension, and addition of basement to include internal alterations.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed basement and ground floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, bulk, mass, height and proximity to shared boundaries result in an overbearing effect and increased sense of enclosure especially to the occupiers of no. 95 detrimental to the amenity enjoyed by adjoining neighbours contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed roof terraces at ground and first floor, as well as the Juliet balcony at roof level would, by reason of their position and proximity to the shared boundary with no. 91 in particular, result in significant levels of overlooking and an increased perception of overlooking which would have a serious and adverse effect on the privacy of adjacent occupiers. In addition, the screening of the two rear terraces would add significantly to the appearance of the bulk and massing of the rear extensions resulting in an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the neighbours amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed loft conversion including the hip to gable roof alteration and rear dormer, would unbalance the symmetry of this pair of semi-detached properties and appear as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive features to the detriment of the character of the host property and both the garden and street scene, as well as to the visual amenity enjoyed from adjoining properties and in their rear gardens, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan."
