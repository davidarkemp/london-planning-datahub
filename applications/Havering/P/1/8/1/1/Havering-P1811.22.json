    "The proposed outbuilding through its combined footprint and the visual impacts associated would increase the overall volume, bulk and amount of development on the site reducing, and therefore causing harm to, the openness of the Green Belt. The development would fail to align fully with any of the exceptions given within the NPPF and no Very Special Circumstance case has been made which overcomes the in principle and other harm identified.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its scale, bulk and mass and lack of subservience appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature within the landscape and to the area more generally. It would be contrary to the objectives of the NPPF, specifically Para 130 which requires development add to the overall quality of the area, Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2008.",
