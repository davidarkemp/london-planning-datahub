It would further give rise to an uncharacteristically narrow plot, which is at odds with the more spacious width of dwellings locally, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality and the street scene and rear garden environment contrary to Policies 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
