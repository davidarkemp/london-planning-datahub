    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design, scale and proximity to the site boundaries, appear as a dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature within the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of internal and external amenity space, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate internal space, result in cramped living conditions which will provide a poor level of amenity for future occupiers, contrary to the objectives of LDF and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1,687.5 and the Havering CIL payable would be £8,437.5. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
