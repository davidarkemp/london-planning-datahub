    "The site is located within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The proposals by reasons of its scale, mass and unsympathetic roof design with dormer windows on the front and across its width to the rear roof slopes, would alter the inherent rural character of the site. 'Very special circumstances' have not been submitted in this case, the proposal is therefore considered to be inappropriate development which would be harmful to the character and openness of the Green Belt, contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008,  Policy G2 of the London Plan as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed development, in particular, the gabling and front dormer windows, by reason of its width, massing and design would occupy an unacceptably large area of the front roof slope, forming a dominant and visually intrusive feature and unbalance this pair of semi-detached bungalow, detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the emerging Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
