  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The equipment hereby permitted, which at the time of submission had already been installed, shall be operated and maintained in accordance with details set out in Noise Impact Assessment dated 25 February 2021 including those mitigation methods set out in Section 5 which shall, if not already, be installed within 1 month of the date of approval. Thereafter, the equipment shall be properly maintained and operated within design specifications during normal working hours.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises and ensure that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of  06:30am to 18:00pm Monday through Saturday and 07:30am and 16:30pm Sundays, Bank and Public Holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Provision shall be made for the storage of food waste and general waste within the premises ahead of collection and at no time shall any waste in association with the business use hereby permitted be stored outside of the premises.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the applicant/their agent in writing. The revisions involved details of extract equipment including methods of odour dispersion and noise mitigation. Appropriate measures were agreed with the Council's Public Protection team and submitted to the Council on 26-02-2021.",
    "The applicant is reminded that any works or maintenance to nay of the development hereby permitted must be carried out without adversely affecting the safety of/or encroaching upon, Network Rail's adjacent land and airspace and access should not be required to the operational railway environment.",
    "Access to Network Rail's land may not always be granted and if granted may be subject to railway site safety requirements and special provisions with all associated railway costs charged to the applicant. Any works within Network Rail's land would need approval from the Network Rail Asset Protection Engineer. This request should be submitted at least 20 weeks before any works are due to commence on site and the applicant is liable for all associated costs (e.g. all possession, site safety, asset protection presence costs). However, Network Rail is not required to grant permission for any third party access to its land."
