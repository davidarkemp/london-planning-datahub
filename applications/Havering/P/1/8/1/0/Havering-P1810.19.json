    "The proposed development would - through unacceptably small floor areas and inappropriate design and layout of the scheme - provide sub-standard units of accommodation and result in cramped living conditions for future occupants. The proposed development would be unacceptable when assessed against policy 3.5 (and Table 3.3) of the London Plan (MALP 2016), policy D6 (and Table 3.1) of the Draft London Plan (Intend to Publish December 2019), the Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard (March 2015), and policies CP17, DC3, DC4 and DC61 of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Residential Design SPD.",
