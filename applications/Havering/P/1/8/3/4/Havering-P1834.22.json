    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The railings and decorative signage hereby permitted shall be painted Green RAL 6005 and 'TBS London Weathered' stock bricks shall be used in the construction of the piers as confirmed in writing by the agent in writing 14-03-2023 unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure the appropriateness of the finished development and to esure that it would harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development shall be carried out only in strict accordance with the Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Preliminary Aboricultural Method Statement & Tree Protection Plan dated 22/12/2022 and the details shown on drawing no. 9959-D-AIA hereby approved including any tree protection measures set out which shall be maintained throughout the course of the development. In the event that it is not possible to undertake the works in accordance with these documents no works shall take place until alternative measures have been submitted to and agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development accords with the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 26 and 30.  It will also ensure accordance with Section 197 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Whilst the assessment undertaken as part of this submission finds the area of the site to which the permission relates to be of low ecological value, this does not discharge the applicant from responsibilities under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 the contravention of which is a criminal offence.",
    "Precautionary advice for birds",
    "Birds are legally protected during the breeding season and need to be considered in respect of any impact from the proposed work. Work involving vegetation clearance must take place outside the optimum breeding season (March to August inclusive), unless it can be confirmed there are no breeding birds in the proposed work area. Note that birds frequently nest outside of the optimum period, particularly during spells of milder weather. It should never be assumed work can always take place without prior investigation.",
    "Birds generally tend to nest in dense shrub beds and mature trees. Where such vegetation may be affected by the proposed work it will require inspection for nesting birds. For example, but not exclusively, blackbird, dunnock, robin, blue and great tit, pigeons, magpies and crows.",
    "When reinstating vegetation and hardstand following building, install permeable surfaces, water butts and rain gardens. Plant a diverse mix of trees, shrubs and her"
