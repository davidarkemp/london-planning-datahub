  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling, by reason of its detached nature, its proximity to the boundaries of the site and the gabled roof form and rear dormer appear as an incongruous, unduly cramped and unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, which is materially out of character with the prevailing pattern of development, detrimental  contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The submitted Flood Risk Assessment does not comply with the requirements for site-specific flood risk assessments, as set out in paragraphs 30 to 32 of the Flood Risk and Coastal Change section of the Planning Practice Guidance. More specifically, an assessment of the 1% annual probability (1 in 100 year) plus an allowance for climate change flood event has not been undertaken. In addition, the proposed development potentially involves works within 8 metres of the Ravensbourne Culvert and could therefore adversely affect the construction and stability of the Ravensbourne culvert, which will compromise its function. The application fails to demonstrate that there are no more sequentially preferable sites for residential development.  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC48 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy SI 12 of the London Plan 2021 and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Fr",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to PIL Planning via email on 9th March 2021.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £16,500 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of  £2,750 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of ???£25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of ??£125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 110 square metres.",
