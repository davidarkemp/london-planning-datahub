    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 14 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to commencement of the development the applicant shall provide a scheme to the Local Planning Authority for its written approval detailing sound transmission reduction measures to be installed within the proposed new lift shafts separating its component and the existing dwellings  to limit airborne/structure Bourne sound transmission.",
    "The scheme shall be designed in accordance with Approved Document E (2003 Edition incorporating 2004 and 2010 amendments) of the Building Regulations (Table 0.1a, page 12). Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the first use and retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to assess the impact of airborne/structure Bourne sound transmission. Submission of this detail prior to the commencement of any development in the case of new building works will protect the amenity of the existing occupants from noise ingress from the new lifts in",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "A fee is required when submitting details pursuant to the discharge of conditions.  In order to comply with the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012, (as amended), a fee of £116 per request or £34 where the related permission was for extending or altering a dwellinghouse, is needed."
