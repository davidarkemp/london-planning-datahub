    "The outbuilding, by reason of its severing from the main dwelling and independent use, would be an incongruous feature at the rear of the garden. As such it would appear as an uncharacteristic intrusion into the rear garden, against the pattern of the development in the local area. The associated activity of an independent dwelling would be detrimental to residential amenity. In this respect the development is  contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions SPD.",
