  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwellings would, by reason of their location, height, bulk and mass, appear as incongruous and unacceptably dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive features in the rear garden setting which would be harmful to the outlook of neighbouring residents, and therefore have a detrimental impact on their amenity contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the dwellings siting, proportions and proximity to the boundaries of the plot, give rise to a cramped appearance and overdevelopment of the site, which would be harmful to the rear garden scene character of the surrounding area. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email and phone in February 2021.",
    "The potential revisions discussed included:",
    "o\tReducing the number of dwellings",
    "o\tRevising the layout",
    "o\tIncreasing the spacing between buildings",
    "o\tIncreasing the setbacks from boundaries",
    "o\tIncorporating hipped roofs instead of gable ends",
    "The agent submitted a slightly revised site plan on 25 February 2021, however did not submit any further drawings and did not return any emails or phone calls to confirm further. The agent was advised of the intended refusal on 24 March 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £2,420. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
