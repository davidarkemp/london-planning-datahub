    "Precautionary advice for birds",
    "Birds are legally protected during the breeding season and need to be considered in respect of any impact from the proposed work. Work involving vegetation clearance must take place outside the optimum breeding season (March to August inclusive), unless it can be confirmed there are no breeding birds in the proposed work area. Note that birds frequently nest outside of the optimum period, particularly during spells of milder weather. It should never be assumed work can always take place without prior investigation.",
    "Birds generally tend to nest in dense shrub beds and mature trees. Where such vegetation may be affected by the proposed work it will require inspection for nesting birds. For example, but not exclusively, blackbird, dunnock, robin, blue and great tit, pigeons, magpies and crows.",
    "When reinstating vegetation and hardstand following building, install permeable surfaces, water butts and rain gardens. Plant a diverse mix of trees, shrubs and her"
