    "The proposed dwelling due to its site layout would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7,10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the guidance within the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space and internal head height. As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation resulting in poor aspect and outlook with the habitable room windows in close proximity of the boundary with the access road Albyns Farm, would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure, in direct contrast to the aims of Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and NPPF.",
    "The proposed parking for the donor property would by reason of the inadequate depth and manoeuvring space available to the front of the donor property known as No.35 Hayes Drive, Rainham, would be likely to result in a vehicle overhanging the footway to the detriment of highway safety and pedestrian movement contrary to the aims and objectives of Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies T4 and T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "There are two car parking spaces for the proposed two bedroom dwelling, which exceeds the maximum car parking provision of up to one space contrary to the aim of the Mayor to reduce car use and contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Singh by e-mail on 01-03-23.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £10,050 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £10,050 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 67 square metres.",
