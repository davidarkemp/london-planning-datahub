  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed roof alteration would not be subservient to the roof of the property, would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable as it would exacerbate the imbalance between the pair and creates a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by amplifying the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design that would neither preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the subject property or the Gidea Park Conservation Area, contrary to Policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031), Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
