Consequently the proposed dwellings would, by reason of their prominent rear garden location, height, bulk and mass, appear as an incongruous and unacceptably dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive features in the rear garden setting which would be harmful to the appearance and character of the surrounding area and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to the implementation of Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
