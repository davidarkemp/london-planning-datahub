    "The proposed development would, by way of its visual characteristics, unbalanced fenestration and proportions, lack subservience and would materially change the contribution of the dwelling to the detriment of the street-scene and would be thereby harmful to local character contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, siting, position and its relationship close to the neighbouring boundary of the site particularly through its depth, be unneighbourly which would give rise to loss of light; loss of outlook resulting in an uncomfortable overbearing effect and an increased sense of enclosure; harmful to the amenity of No. 18 Bowden Drive contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
