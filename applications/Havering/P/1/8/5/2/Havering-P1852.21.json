    "The development, by reason of the intensity and frequency of use, particularly in the early mornings and evenings and the location of the existing building on a very narrow and congested one way road, would result in unacceptable levels of noise and general disturbance associated with the proposed uses, harmful to the residential amenity of neighbouring properties contrary to London Plan Policy D14, Policies 16 and 34 of the Local Plan 2016- 2031.",
    "In the absence of a Full Parking Survey, the proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision for the proposed facilities/level of activities, result in unacceptable overspill onto the neighbouring roads to the detriment of the free flow of traffic and thereby harmful to highway safety and residential amenity contrary to London Plan Policies D5, T6 and T5, Policies 23 and 24 of the Local Plan 2016- 2031.",
