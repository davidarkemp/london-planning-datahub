    "The proposed part two storey side and single storey rear extensions, by reason of its size, excessive depth, sitting, design and proximity to the boundaries, would be a visually intrusive feature, overbearing and unneighbourly development as well as having adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers in terms of visual impact, cause loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure which would have a significant effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers (especially no. 99).  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
