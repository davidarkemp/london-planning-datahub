Native insects, birds and other animals cannot survive without the food and shelter that these plants provide. Introduced plants usually offer little to our native wildlife. Local plants are the essence of regional identity and preserve the character of the British landscape. Local plants are adapted to local soils and climate, so have low maintenance requirements. In addition, planting locally native plants helps to prevent the spread of invasive plants in the region.",
