    "The proposed side and rear extension by reason of its bulk, scale and design would not integrate well with the existing dwellinghouse and would detract from its character, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the rear garden scene and the wider streetscene resulting in a development that would be considered incongruous. This would be contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed hardstanding to replace the existing soft landscaping is considered to represent a loss in visual amenity and will also increase flood risk due to the lack of permeability offered by the hardstanding. As such, this would be contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
