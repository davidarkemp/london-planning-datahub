    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Breden (Agent) by phone and e-mail. The revisions were sought seeking clarity in respect to the materials being used and also due to an anomaly on the drawing in relation to the overall height of the wall and railings above. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 19-10-22 & 24-11-22."
