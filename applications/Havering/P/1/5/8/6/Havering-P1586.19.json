  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension to the property would by reason of its size and inappropriate design be an unacceptably large and dominant addition to the existing building, and would fail to integrate well into the host building. Consequently the proposed extension would be unacceptable when assessed against policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), draft London Plan policy D4, and policies CP17 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008. Furthermore, as the wording of policy DC61 is unambiguous, planning permission must be refused.",
    "The application would be inconsistent with the previous decision made by the Local Planning Authority; in particular with the need to provide an adequately-sized area on site for the keeping of the hire cars as required under application P0255.13. Consequently, as the resultant space to the rear of the property would not be sufficiently large for the keeping of vehicles, the application must be refused for the purposes of probity and consistency of decision making by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "The proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the safe operation of the highway, the footpath and the area more generally. These concerns are inherent with the application, and as no conditions can be used to overcome these concerns, the application would be unacceptable when assessed against policies DC33, and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008. Furthermore, as the wording of policy DC61 is unambiguous, planning permission must be refused.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, officers contacted the agent for the application prior to the assessment of the application. The application would propose development that would change the use of the property; which is not what was applied for. Officers identified this with the agents prior to the assessment of the application, and the agent did not agree any changes to the description of development.",
    "Officers have seen from aerial photography from 2016 that there is a side extension to the host building; although this is not shown on the submitted drawings. At the time of assessment, officers have been unable to visit the site due to social distancing measures put in place during the Covid-19 global pandemic. Consequently, officers have not been able to validate or verify the submitted plans, and if they accurately reflect the development on site; and instead having to rely on aerial photography available from the London Borough of Havering, and information from third-party providers (Google Streetview©, Apple Maps©, etc.).",
    "The site as existing contains several pieces of development which, and upon review of the planning history of the site, have no planning permissions granted for them. Irrespective of the assessment made in this application, the lawful status of development on site cannot be stated with any degree of certainty (not least from the inability of officers from currently being able to inspect the site), and the assumptions made in this application regarding existing development does not prejudice the ability of the Local Planning Authority from being able to undertake an investigation, or from being to taken planning enforcement action against, any unlawful development.",
    "Whilst acknowledging the limitations of the description of development, the application would propose a change of use of the land; which was not made clear in the submitted application form and the description of development that was sent out to consultees, neighbours and other interested parties. This has prejudiced the ability of interested parties and any other member of the public from making comments on what is being proposed, and the application would be unacceptable in terms of clarity and probity, the avoidance of doubt and the interests of proper planning.",
    "Whilst acknowledging the limitations of the description of development, the application would propose industrial and business uses on the land which fall outside of: the Green Belt; a designated employment area; Romford town centre; or a district or local centre. Consequently the introduction of industrial and business uses on the land would not be supported in principle if assessed under policy DC11 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008."
