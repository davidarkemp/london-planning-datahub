    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive depth, height, bulk and proximity to neighbouring properties be an intrusive and overbearing form of development, giving rise to an undue sense of enclosure, loss of light and outlook, which would have a serious adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
