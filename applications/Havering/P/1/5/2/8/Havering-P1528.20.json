    "The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk, mass, scale, together with lack of subordination and excessive front projection, unbalances the appearance of this pair of semi-detached dwellings and forms an unacceptably dominant, visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden environment, harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area in contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
