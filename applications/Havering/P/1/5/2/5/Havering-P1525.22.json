    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development does not provide the minimum space standards as outlined in table 3.1 of the London Plan and fails to provide the minimum floor to ceiling standard for 75% of the dwelling to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers resulting in substandard residential accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Havering Local plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent via email on 14th December 2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2037.50 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £10187.50 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
