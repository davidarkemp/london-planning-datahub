    "In the absence of a Noise and Vibration Assessment, given the location of site in close proximity of the railway lines, the proposals would result in the creation of a subbstandard level of accommodation with significant level of noise and vibration  which would adversely impact on the living condition of future occupiers, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policies DC55 and  DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on/adjacent site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policies DC60 and DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking additional details which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Council and the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£7,650. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
