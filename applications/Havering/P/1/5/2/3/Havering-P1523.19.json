    "The proposed changes to the host application would - through the introduction of a 24 hour night time use outside of a town centre, and in an area that does not have such uses - be unacceptable in principle, and uncharacteristic for the area. The proposed changes would therefore be unacceptable when assessed against policies 7.4 and 7.15 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), policies GC1, SD6, D14, HC6 of the draft London Plan, and policies DC23, DC55 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed changes to the host application would, through an increase in noise and disturbance, arising from the proposed 24 hour operation of the site, have an unacceptable impact on neighbouring amenity, and would be unacceptable when considered against paragraph 180 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 and 7.15 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), and policies DC23, DC55 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
