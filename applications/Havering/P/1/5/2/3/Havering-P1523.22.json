    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed annexe shall be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as 118 Pettits Lane, Romford, and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",

    "Reason:-  In order that the annex/outbuilding approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015,  Schedule 2, Part 1, Class I and its interpretation of Part 1 no decking or raised platform shall be erected or constructed within 1 metre of the annexe/outbuilding unless permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-   In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwellings.",
    "The garden area shall not be sub-divided at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex/outbuilding approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling.",
    "Any residential occupation of the building hereby approved shall be limited to a close relative of the occupiers of the main dwelling and shall not be occupied by any other persons.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the annex/outbuilding approved remains ancillary to the main dwelling.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with KMDS Designs.
