    "The proposed extensions would, by reason of their cumulative scale, bulk and proximity to no. 12 East Close, give rise to an intrusive and overbearing form of development that is disproportionate to the host dwelling, appearing cramped and out of character in the streetscene, as well as being intrusive and overbearing in relation to no.12 East Close and materially harmful to amenity and contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The arrangement of bedrooms of the ground floor flat below the living area of the first floor flat, combined with poor quality outlook from bedroom 2 of the ground floor flat, loss of privacy of bedroom 2 of the ground floor flat when the occupiers of the first floor flat access the rear garden, inadequate floor area of the first floor flat and the poor access arrangements from the first floor flat to the rear garden would give rise to a poor quality living environment for future occupiers of the flats, contrary to Policy 7 and 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
