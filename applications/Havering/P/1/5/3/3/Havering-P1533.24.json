    "The proposed side extension would, by reason of its scale, bulk and proximity to the neighbouring property no.4 Thurso Close, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed side extension would, by reason of its shape, positioning, bulk and mass close to the boundaries of the site, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area as well as unbalancing the appearance of the pair of semi-detached houses, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would provide no parking leading to an increased demand for on-road parking in the area to the detriment of the safety and functioning of the highway contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
