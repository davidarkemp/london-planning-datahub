All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To preserve visual amenity and biodiversity and to ensure that the development accords with Local Plan policy 27.  It will also ensure accordance with Section 197 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The proposed boundary treatment shall be constructed in accordance to the details hereby approved on drawing no. 1345-C-102 Rev A and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
