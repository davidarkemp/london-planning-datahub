    "The proposed side extension in combination with its roof form would introduce an incongruous feature; appear cramped due to the plot constraint; unacceptably harm the symmetrical aspect of the pair of the semi-detached building and would fail to maintain the open characteristic gap of the streetscene. As a result, it would detract from the character of the original dwelling and immediate surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
