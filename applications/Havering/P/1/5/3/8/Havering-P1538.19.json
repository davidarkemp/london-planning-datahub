  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal is an incongruous form of development within the rear garden environment, out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of development, and unserviceable for fire safety purposes, therefore harmful to local character and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity and public safety, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008. Further, and under the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, priority is given to infill and brownfield development to increase housing supply. However, and as advised within Annex 2 of the NPPF, previously developed land excludes land in built-up areas such as residential gardens. Therefore, and in accordance with paragraph 11 of the NPPF, there is no presumption in favour of development, as the proposal conflicts with the application of policies in the Framework itself.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in email on 3/12/19.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £1587.50 and £7937.50. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
