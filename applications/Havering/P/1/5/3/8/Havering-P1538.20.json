  "description": "Proposed second storey extension to existing annexe.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt. The proposed development would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk, mass, depth and siting, result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building, constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt and result in material harm to the character and openness of the Metropolitan Green Belt  contrary to Policies CP14 and DC45 of the London Borough of Havering's Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy G2 of the London Plan 2017 and the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018. No very special circumstances exist in this case to justify a deviation from policy.",
    "The proposed development would, given its height, pitched roof and fenestration, closely resemble a two storey detached dwelling and combined with its siting located between No.'s 63 and 65 Shepherds Hill, lack subservience to the existing dwelling and appear unduly cramped, incongruous, visually intrusive and out of character in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The first floor window on the rear elevation of the proposed development would, by reason of its width, siting and position close to the eastern boundary of the site, cause overlooking and loss of privacy, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of No. 65 Shepherds Hill contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Angus via email on 21st January 2021."
