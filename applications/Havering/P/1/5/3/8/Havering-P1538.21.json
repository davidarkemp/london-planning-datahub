    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and massing, be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development and would present as a dominant feature, detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to reduce the height and width of the building were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application.  However, the impact of the extended dwelling on the street scene  was considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable.  Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
