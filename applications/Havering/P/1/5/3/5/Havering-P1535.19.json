    "The proposed first floor rear extension would by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, relate unacceptably to the existing dwelling and would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden scene. The development would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Adopted London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The combined depth of the existing single storey rear extension and proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development, which would be most oppressive and give rise to an undue sense of enclosure in the rear garden environment to the detriment of residential amenity contrary to the Adopted London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Asad Durrani by e-mail on 02/12/2019."
