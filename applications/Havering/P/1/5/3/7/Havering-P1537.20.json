  "description": "2 x Two storey semi-detached dwellings with associated parking and amenity space, single storey rear extension to 24 Dunmow Drive.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its positioning, bulk and mass, appear cramped and would fill the characteristic gap at the end of the cul-de-sac, which is seen as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of its siting, layout and positioning of the proposed new dwellings, result in an unsatisfactory relationship between building blocks leading to loss of privacy, light and outlook to the detriment of amenity for future residents of the proposed dwelling at No. 26A Dunmow Drive, which is contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the agent via email and phone message on 16 December 2020.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £4,835 and the Havering CIL payable would be £24,175.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
