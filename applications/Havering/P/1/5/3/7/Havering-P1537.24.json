    "The outbuilding by reason of its size, bulk and mass, and the adverse cumulative impact with the existing outbuilding to the west of the site would appear as an overly dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature not subordinate in scale to the existing dwelling and impair the visual amenity of the site and locality, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2011).",
    "The applicant has failed to adequately demonstrate, given the existing layout of the site and lack of connectivity between the main dwelling and the outbuilding, that the outbuilding is ancillary to the main dwelling and that the outbuilding is not a separate unit of accommodation.  Given this the outbuilding provides very poor aspect and outlook from habitable rooms, very limited amenity space and would be subject to noise and disturbance from the adjacent business, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriement of the amenity of the occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 and Policy 10 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
