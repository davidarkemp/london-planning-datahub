    "The proposed front extension/porch, hip-to-gable roof extension with front and rear dormers would, by reason of their individual and cumulative scale, massing, design and character appear incongruous development to the existing host building, unbalance the appearance of this semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene, rear gardens and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to agent in writing 11-02-2025."
