    "The proposed flats would fail to provide acceptable standard of accommodation, due to inadequate and poor level of private amenity especially for the occupiers at unit 1, noise impacts in absence of Noise Impact Assessment and would in the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise receive unacceptable levels of daylight, which would significantly impact on the living conditions of future occupiers. The proposals are contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and London Plan Policy D6, D13 and D14. The proposal would also fail to accord with the core principle set out in section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings.",
