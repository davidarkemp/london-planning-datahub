    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to the development hereby approved until samples of all materials to be used in the external construction of the buildings are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",

Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",

All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Any landscaping should not project higher than 0.6 metres within the visibility splay detailed on the drawing no. L04 J.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",

    "Prior to first occupation, cycling storage facilities in association with the proposed development shall be implemented in accordance with the details shown on the submitted and approved plans. The cycle storage facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:- In the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "No piling shall take place until a piling method statement (detailing the depth and type of piling to be undertaken and the methodology by which such piling will be carried out, including measures to prevent and minimise the potential for damage to subsurface sewerage infrastructure, and the programme for the works) has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority in consultation with Thames Water.",

The scheme shall detail the acoustic/noise insulation performance of the external building envelope of the residential units (having regard to the building fabric, glazing and ventilation) and other mitigation to reduce the level of noise experienced internally at the proposed residential units as a result of high ambient noise levels in the area.  The approved scheme shall be fully implemented prior to occupation of the residential units.",
    "Reason: To protect the amenity of residential properties",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to the development hereby approved until an assessment has been undertaken of the impact of noise emanating from Ardleigh Green Road upon the development.",
    "Reference should be made to the \"good\" standard to be found in the World Health Organisation Guidelines for Community Noise 1999 and BS8233:2014 Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings.
