    "The proposed development would result in cramming of the site resulting in poor outlook, oppressive environment and a sense of enclosure for future inhabitants, which would result in a cramped overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of future inhabitants, contrary to the London Plan (adopted 2021) and DC61 of the Core Strategy DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposed development would appear out of character and disrupt the established pattern of development, that could create an undesirable precedent in the area that is harmful to the streetscene and rear garden scene, contrary to Policy DC61 of Havering's Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (the Core Strategy), the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, the Design SPD, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal would result in a dominant, intrusive, incongruous and out of character development, with a greater depth and height than would otherwise be permitted in this location and would introduce a higher level of noise, smells and general comings and goings associated with a dwelling house that would not be expected in the rear garden environment, contrary to Policy DC61 of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (the Core Strategy)..",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the loss of car parking and inadequate on site car parking provision for the host dwelling at no. 60 Slewins Lane, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to the London Plan (adopted 2021).",
    "While not reasons for refusal in their own right, the following should be noted if further applications are made. Only 1.5sqm of internal storage space has been shown, when a minimum of 2sqm is required, as outlined in the London Plan (adopted 2021).",
    "No section drawings have been supplied to measure the acceptability of the floor to ceiling heights. The minimum floor to ceiling height must be 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of the Gross Internal Area of each dwelling, in accordance with the London Plan (adopted 2021). Section drawings should be submitted if making another planning application.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £1,186 at a rate of £25 per sqm (71.44m² x 25).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £5,930.",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal for it was given to the agent in writing via email."
