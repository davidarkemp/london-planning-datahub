  "description": "Proposed single storey outbuilding with pitched roof to create games room",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed outbuilding would, by reason of its size, bulk and mass, appear incongruous and be  unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment and street scene, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its combined height, bulk, mass and position close to the boundaries of the site and projection forward of the building line is considered to be an unneighbourly development which is out of scale with its surroundings and creates a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, that is harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alteration SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Development Control Policies Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Gunn (Agent) by e-mail on 22/12/20."
