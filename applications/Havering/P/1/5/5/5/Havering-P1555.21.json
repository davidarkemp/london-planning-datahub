    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive built density, would have an overly intensive and harmful impact on the function of the immediate area by reason of excessive pressure on the local highway network and impact on local amenity.  The exclusion of key parts of the urban blocks fails to give rise to a consolidated and comprehensive scheme, and the inadequate information provided fails to demonstrate that the density of residential accommodation proposed could function sustainably given the density as proposed exceeds the optimum levels of accommodation for the site.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies, GG1, D1 and D3, and T3 of the London Plan, the Havering Residential Design SPD and Policies 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the adopted Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its resultant overall height, scale and bulk and its poor design (blank facades), would give rise to buildings that fail to have regard to the context of the site and would be dominant, unsympathetic and have an unacceptable relationship with nearby properties, resulting in an overbearing and visually dominant development to the detriment of the character and appearance of area. The public realm strategy presents fundamental concerns due to the exclusion of core elements of the urban blocks and the submitted information does not demonstrate that practical implementation of functional public realm and a high levels of design quality can be achieved.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies D4, D5 and D6, D8 D9 of the London Plan and Policies 1, 3, 7 and 26 of the adopted Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, scale and mass creates an unacceptable arrangement within the site and immediate area, which would appear unduly dominant and overbearing when viewed from the rear gardens of neighbouring properties on South Street, Walden Avenue and Queens Gardens presenting a harmful overbearing impact and reduction of outlook and light to the occupiers of these neighbouring dwellings. It is therefore considered that the proposal would not ensure that an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring residential occupiers would be provided, in accordance with the requirements of Policy 7 of the adopted Havering Local Plan.",
    "The excessive density and building heights and illustrative site layout and design typology would fail to provide a high-quality living environment which is sustainable and provides a high standard of accommodation and amenity for future residents due to the number of single aspect units and poor levels of natural light at lower levels. The proposed dwelling mix would fail to provide adequate provision of family accommodation on site.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupants of land and buildings, policies D6 and H10 of the London Plan and policies 5 and 7 of the adopted Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would exclude key elements of the urban blocks and would be an agent of change yet would result in the retention of existing established noise and nuisance-generating uses adjoining the proposed hybrid application site which would unduly prejudice the satisfactory operation of this adjoining land, its viability and capacity to continue or grow without unreasonable restrictions being placed on the site operators contrary to policy D13 of the London Plan.",
    "In the absence of a suitable legal agreement to secure the contributions towards road and bus service improvements securement of affordable housing and a carbon offset payment, child play space and the neighbouring Beam Parkway public realm scheme the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of policies G5, H6, S4, T3, T4, T5, T9 an DF1 of the London Plan and policies 3, 4, 12, 23 and 24 of the adopted Havering Local Plan."
