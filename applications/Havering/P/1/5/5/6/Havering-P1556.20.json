    "The proposed development would, by reason of its depth, height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably incongruous, overbearing dominant feature which is visually intrusive to the character of the host dwelling and rear garden environment contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive depth, combined with the existing two storey rear extension and proximity to neighbouring properties be an intrusive and overbearing form of development, giving rise to an undue sense of enclosure, loss of light and outlook, which would have a serious adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Paul Robinson via email on the 23rd December 2020."
