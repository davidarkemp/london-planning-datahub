  "description": "Erection of second floor for use as 1x 2bed self contained flats, involving alterations to existing roof to replace existing flat roof with a mansard style roof.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of the overall scale and mass of the building and close proximity to site boundaries, would give rise to a cramped, overdevelopment of the site, detrimental to local character and amenity and contrary to the provisions of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers in terms of the level of private amenity space proposed, which would be in direct contrast to the aims and objectives of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the DCLG Technical Housing Standards.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be: Mayoral CIL = £2,575.00 and Havering CIL = £12,875.00. Total CIL = £15,450.00 subject to indexation.  Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
