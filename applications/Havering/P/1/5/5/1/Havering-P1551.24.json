    "The proposed dwelling appears as an incongruous addition to the streetscene with little in common with the donor property or surrounding environment. The scale and design of the proposed dwelling, particularly its conspicuously narrow profile, constrained plot size and uncharacteristic plot layout at odds with the existing urban grain would appear as an incongruous and visually intrusive addition to the streetscene. The layout shown, design concept and massing would be regarded as being at odds with the established urban grain and detrimental to local character. As such there would be conflict with the objectives of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, specifically Policies 7 and 26, as well as the NPPF and London Plan 2021.",
    "Through failure to meet with the minimum prescribed gross internal floor area required the proposed dwelling would fail to comply with the requirements of London Plan Policy D6, Havering  Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7 and in doing so conflict with Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development creates places with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users. The failure to comply with minimum prescribed standards in full is not reflective of this or the broader objectives of the London Plan/Local Plan.",
    "The proposals would remove all available/potential parking for the donor dwelling. The cumulative impact of the lack of dedicated off-street parking for both the proposed and donor property  has not been evidenced not to result in unacceptable overspill parking onto surrounding roads to the detriment of  the convenience and amenity of other residents and highway safety/free flow of movement more generally, particularly close to this busy road junction . The proposals therefore fail to comply with Havering Local Plan 206-2031 Policies 23 and 24, London Plan T6. There would also be conflict with Paragraph 116 of the Framework.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the cramped nature of the amenity space provision, in combination with the enclosed nature of the garden area and the proximity of main habitable room windows to the boundary enclosures would give rise to an oppressive and poor quality residential environment, with poor quality amenity space provision and a restricted and poor quality outlook from the principal ground floor habitable room, to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers of the site, contrary to the Havering  Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 7, London Plan Policy D6 and Paragraph 135 of the NPPF",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 21-01-2025",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £925 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £4625 based on calculation of £125 per square metre (37 gross new). Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
