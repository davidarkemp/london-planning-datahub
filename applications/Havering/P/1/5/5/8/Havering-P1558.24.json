    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed roof light adjacent to No.83 Chestnut Avenue, Hornchurch as windows as shown on drawings nos. MS21803 Sheet 1 of 1 Rev 1 & MS21804 Sheet 1 of 1 Rev 1 shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than level 4 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "Implementation of Proposal Informative",
    "The implementation of both D0479.24 and P1558.24 at the same time may invalidate one or both of these applications and as a result a fresh planning application may be required as the proposal would be contrary to the approved plans and the resultant volume may exceed the 40 cubic metres allowance allowed for the proposed loft extension under permitted development.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Olesea Morozan by phone and e-mail. The revisions involved replacing the parapet detail with a sit on gutter and replacing the gable roof over the existing first floor rear extension to a hip roof with additional annotation of the drawing regarding the side roof light as no cross section was provided. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 10/12/24."
