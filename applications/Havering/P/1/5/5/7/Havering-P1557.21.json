    "The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk, width and prominent siting on its plot boundaries fail to integrate acceptably with the host dwelling and result in a cramped form of development which would appear as an anomaly within the wider street scene and would be visually intrusive, out of scale and character with the established pattern of development in the surrounding environment contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and criteria contained in the Adopted London Borough of Havering  SPD on Residential Design 2010.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its lack of private amenity space provides a constrained and sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers which would adversely impact on their living condition, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its inadequate details on car parking provision and allocation between the existing and proposed uses, inadequate cycle and refuse facilities on site would adversely impact on the living condition of occupiers at no.142 - 144 and prospective occupiers of the proposed development, and would be considered to result in an unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC33 of the LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Council and the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £13,200 subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
