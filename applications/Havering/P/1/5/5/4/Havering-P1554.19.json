  "description": "Change of use of existing outbuilding to D1 (Podiatry Clinic) (retrospective).",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The change of use would appear to be able to be independently used and accessed and by reason of inappropriate location, inadequate transport links, and the impact on residential amenity of the donor property, as well as being a use that is out of character for the area, and having a detrimental impact on parking and highway safety, result in an unacceptable land use on this site; and no conditions or planning obligations can be used to address any concerns. The development is unacceptable in principle, and when assessed against the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, and policies DC26 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The change of use would, by reason of its layout, have an unacceptable impact on parking provision for the donor property (dwellinghouse) and would through parking displacement have an unacceptable impact on parking on the road, as well as highway safety. The change of use would fail to integrate into the existing uses, and is unacceptable when assessed against policy 6.13 and 6.9 of the London Plan MALP 2016, and policies DC33, DC35, DC61 and DC62 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy and principle objection to the land use, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent prior to issuing the decision.",
    "This application resulted from a planning enforcement investigation by the Local Planning Authority. This application sought to assess the planning merits of the change of use as supplied in the application submission. Consideration was given as to whether any impacts could be overcome by way of imposing conditions or planning obligations; or if a refusal would hold up against scrutiny at appeal (as required by the Secretary of State and guidance from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government). In any event this application does not substantively conclude whether enforcement action is expedient or necessary, and the planning enforcement team will be able to advise further on enforcement matters."
