    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans and Technical Detail for canopy (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",

    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All new external finishes shall accord with the details specified on drawing no. BGR/A1/001 Revision 05 hereby approved.",
    "Reason:-",

    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
