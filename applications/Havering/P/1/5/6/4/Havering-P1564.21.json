    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public, students and the school and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "Within 6 months of occupation of the new classroom extension, the existing classroom block to be replaced shall be removed from the site (including all rubble and spoil) and the footprint of the former block shall be landscaped appropriately to maximise the opportunity for greening through the planting of trees and/or other soft landscaping.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the character and appearance and the visual amenity of the area and to ensure that the new extension respects the buildings of the surrounding physical context and does not lead to a cramped layout onsite (Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Development Control Document, Policies 26 and 27 of the Havering Draft Local Plan, policies D4 and G6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "No demolition, construction works or deliveries into the site shall take place other than between the hours of 08.00 to 18.00 on Monday to Friday and 08.00 to 13.00 hours on Saturdays unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority. No construction works or deliveries shall take place on Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.",

    "With regards to surface water drainage it is the responsibility of the developer to make proper provision for drainage to ground, water courses or a suitable sewer.  In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of Ground Water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required.  They can be contacted on 0845 850 2777.",
