    "The proposed development by reason of the resultant scale, bulk and mass of the host property and design concept in a prominent corner location would appear dominant and visually intrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area. The formation of a side extension of the form shown would extend beyond the front building line of premises to the rear exacerbating its visual prominence and would close down the spacious junction thereby contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6.",
