    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",

    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",

The measurement position, assessment and definitions shall be made according to BS4142:2014 + A1:2019 \"Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound.\"",
    "The equipment shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority, and the use hereby permitted must cease during any period that this condition is not complied with.",
