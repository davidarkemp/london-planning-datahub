    "The proposed extension would, by reason of it not appearing as part of the main dwelling, enclosing the gap on the side of a detached house and introducing an excessive height and bulk close to the side boundaries, appear incongruous and out of character for the main dwelling, the streetscape and the rear garden scene, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposed side/rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers resulting in a sense of overbearing development, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011)and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD (adopted 2008).",
