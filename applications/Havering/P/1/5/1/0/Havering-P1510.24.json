    "The proposed dwelling and detached garage, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, prominent siting forward of the building line would appear incongruous, visually intrusive, unduly cramped and out of character with the prevailing pattern of development, detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality and the street scene and rear garden environment contrary to Policies 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through insufficient floor to ceiling height of the dwelling and the development would therefore give rise to a poor quality residential environment, harmful to the amenities of the occupiers. As a result, the development would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would appear intrusive and overbearing and result in harm to the amenity of the adjoining occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7,10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the guidance within the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation resulting in poor aspect and outlook with the habitable room windows in close proximity of the neighbouring boundary and would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure, in direct contrast to the aims of Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan and with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed drop kerb to the front of donor property would not be a minimum of 4.5m in width and that would be within 10m from the nearby junction which would be contrary to the London Borough of Havering Domestic Vehicle Dropped Kerb Policy (April 2023). As such the proposal does not make adequate provision for off-street parking, which is considered would have adverse impact on vehicular movement and pedestrian safety in the vicinity. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and London Plan 2021 Policy T6.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Jaffa (Agent) by phone on 14-03-25.",

    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £17,400 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £17,400 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 116 square metres.",
