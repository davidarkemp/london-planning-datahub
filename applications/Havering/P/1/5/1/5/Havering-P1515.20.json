    "The site is within the area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The footprint and volume of the proposed built form is considered to be excessive, and viewed cumulatively along with the existing buildings added to the site would contribute to urban sprawl and harm the open character of the green belt. Insufficient supporting information has been provided to justify the scale of the proposed built form or demonstrate that the benefits of the proposal would outweigh any harm caused to the green belt, and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the L",
    "The proposed development would, by way of its excessive clearing of vegetation, within a site of nature conservation importance and within the Thames Chase Community Forest area, result in adverse impacts to biodiversity that would be contrary to Policy DC 22, DC 58 and DC 60 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the provisions of the NPPF. Insufficient supporting ecological information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development would not cause harm to biodiversity and alternative sites have not been explored to reduce the harm to biodiversity and limit the clearing of vegetation.",

Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£3800(subject to indexation). Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website",
