    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their excessive width, height, bulk and mass are disproportionate additions to the existing buildings and would appear unacceptably dominant, visually intrusive and represent an over-development of both dwellings at No's 8 and 9 Convent Close. The excessive scale of the extensions would detract from the small scale nature of both existing dwellings harmful to their character and the wider appearance of the surrounding development of which  forms part, and would be unacceptably harmful to the setting of the Grade II listed building contrary to Policies 7, 26 and 28 of the Local Plan, Policy 7.4 of the London Plan and the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr D Brandon (Agent) by e-mail on the 03/01/2024.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £7,110 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £35,716 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Please note this is the total for both dwellings combined.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
