    "The proposed two storey side extension would, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, mass, and cramped appearance would unacceptably unbalance the appearance of these properties, and therefore appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the London Borough of Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height and position close to the boundary of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.2 Church Road, Romford contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the London Borough of Havering's  Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011, and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
