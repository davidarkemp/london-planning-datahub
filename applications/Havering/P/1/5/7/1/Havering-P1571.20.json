  "description": "Erection of an outbuilding north-east of the main dwelling to provide a workshop, home office, storage, open garage and closed garage space.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed outbuilding given its bulk, scale and massing and in the absence of any very special circumstances, is considered to be inappropriate development and as such would be harmful to the openness and character of the Green Belt. The proposals therefore fail to comply with the advice in the NPPF and are also contrary to Policy DC45 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy.",
    "The proposed outbuilding given its bulk, scale, massing and close proximity to the Listed Building, would result in an unsympathetic development that would fail to preserve the setting and open character of the listed building and that of its significance as a heritage asset. Furthermore, the cumulative impact of these proposals and nearby recent development to the north, would further exacerbate the encroachment on the inherent open character of the listed building. In the absence of a Heritage Statement to address the associated significance and impacts of the proposal on the listed building,  the proposals fail to preserve the setting and open character of the listed building, contrary to the advice in the NPPF and Policy DC67 of the Council Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position, proximity, mass, bulk and height would have an overbearing effect and would cause an adverse impact on the visual amenity enjoyed from the neighbouring property and the host property, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr L Nicholson (agent) by email on 23/12/20."
