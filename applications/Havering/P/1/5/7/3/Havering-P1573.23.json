The footprint of the first floor rear extension is shown on the plan to be the same (granted vs built- 2.5m to the side and 3.35m deep) but the elevations show changes in the scale and size.  There is a larger window shown on the 'already built' rear elevation at first floor which is not reflected on the plan. The plans show the height of the first floor rear extension as 6.7m high when the approved height was 6.5m.  No porch shown on the plans or submitted photos.",
