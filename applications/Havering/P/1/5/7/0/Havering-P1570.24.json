    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "The Construction Method statement shall include details of:",
    "a.\tThe site access point(s) of all vehicles to the site during the construction phase",
    "b.\tparking of vehicles of site personnel and visitors;",
    "c.\tstorage of plant and materials;",

    "Notwithstanding the details shown on submitted plans/visuals, prior to any above ground works written specification/and or samples of all materials to be used in the external construction of the building shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be fitted with Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with these details and shall thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "If Air Source Heat Pumps are to be fitted to serve the development hereby permitted, a report under the provisions of the Microgeneration Installation Standard: MCS 020 shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to determine if the equipment would be deemed permitted development, or a full planning application will be required.",
    "Reason:   To protect the amenity of noise sensitive premises from noise from mechanical plant.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on approved plans, prior to any above ground works details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority. This shall extend to a redefined boundary for the ground floor three bedroom four person unit to introduce buffer space from the public realm to St Marys Lane. The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on submitted drawings no building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on submitted drawings  no building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking. Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability",
    "Prior to their installation full details of the PV Panels to be installed to the flat roofed section including their exact specification and appearance shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the visual  impacts of the renewable systems reflect the scheme as approved.",

    "Reason: To protect residential amenity.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the proposed dwellings hereby approved the area set aside for car parking and access shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and any works required to facilitate acess to the building shall be completed. The parking shall then be retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason: To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "All dwellings hereby permitted where achievable shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations - Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D7 of the London Plan.",

    "The equipment shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority, and the use hereby permitted must cease during any period that this condition is not complied with.",

    "The windows on the west facing elevation and the first floor window on the south facing elevation shall be fixed shut (aiside from fan-lights) and fitted with obscure glazing not less than level four on the standard scale of obscurity up to a height of 1.80m above finished floor level and this shall be maintained for the life of the development.",
    "Reason: In the interests of neighbouring amenity and so as not to prejudice the redevelopment of the adjacent site.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on submitted plans prior to any above ground works details of alternative materials and/or screening for the balconies/terraced areas hereby permitted shall be submitted for the approval of the Local Planning Authority. The balconies as agreed shall then be implemented and maintained for the life of the development",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of ensuring that terraced areas offer the appropriate level of privacy and amenity for future residents and to comply with the objectives of Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan",

    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is 25/mÂ² and is chargeable for each additional square metre of residential gross internal [floor] (GIA).
