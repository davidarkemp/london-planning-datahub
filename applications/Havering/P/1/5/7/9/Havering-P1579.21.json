    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No works to construct the first floor extension hereby permitted, as shown on approved drawings 6113-06 A and 6113-05, shall take place in the event that any works to extend the first floor under permission P0365.14 have first been implemented.",
    "Reason:",
    "The grant of this permission  is considered acceptable in terms of Green Belt policy as an alterative to the proposals permitted under P0365.14 and P0616.16.  The implementation of all 3 proposals would have a significant adverse impact on the openness of the Green Belt and would not be acceptable in accordance with the guidance in the NPPF and The Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The proposed windows to the south flank of the proposed day room shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted is first used, at least two off street parking spaces shall be set aside, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agents via telephone and emails. The revisions involved scale down the proposed extension and removal of the proposed boundary fence and gate. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 23.03.22."
