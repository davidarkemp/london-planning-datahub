    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in any wall of the building hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development, a written assessment shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to assess the impact of noise emanating from the local transport network and neighbouring commercial uses upon the development.  The assessment should detail measures to protect occupants from transport noise and such measures shall be implemented and validated prior to occupation.",
    "Reference should be made to the \"good\" standard to be found in the World Health Organisation Guidelines for Community Noise 1999 and BS8233:2014 Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings.  Reference should also be made to the Acoustics Ventilation & Overheating Residential Design Guide 2020.",
    "Reason:  To protect residents against the impact of noise from the local environment.",
    "Prior to commencement of this planning permission, a written assessment and scheme of the sound insulation between the hereby permitted residential units as well as the unit below on the 3rd floor shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. Sound insulation must be provided of 43 DnT,w + Ctr dB (minimum values) against airborne noise and 64 LnTw dB (maximum values) against impact noise to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. The approved details shall be implemented before the subdivided units are occupied.",
    "Reason:  To protect the amenity of the residential premises.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Please note that the Building Regulations (Part E) should be complied with, as the sound insulation between the proposed new flats may not meet current standards."
