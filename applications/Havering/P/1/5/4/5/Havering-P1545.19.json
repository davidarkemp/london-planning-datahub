    "Notwithstanding the provisions of Class A3, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), no additional first floor window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank or rear walls of the building hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The area set aside for car-parking as shown on drawing no. H0A03/A to serve no. 5 Heath Drive shall be made available for vehicle parking and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles attending/visiting that premises",

    "House indicated as \"new\" on submitted drawings is development that was approved under application P1546.09. Implementation of this consent commenced some years ago however the property remains under construction at the time of site inspection and is not presentably habitable. For the avoidance of doubt, the arrangements hereby approved would supersede those of approved plans."
