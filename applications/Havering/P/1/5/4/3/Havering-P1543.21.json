    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass, and height appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the garden scene, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of London Plan, the Residential Extension and Alteration Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed development by reason of their excessive depth, height and position close to the common boundaries of the site, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers in terms of loss of light and visual impact, contrary to the Residential Extension and Alteration Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £26,100. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
