    "The proposed outbuilding would, by reason of its overall bulk, scale, layout and position close to the shared boundaries of the site and in particular with it's independent use would be an incongruous feature at the rear of the garden. As such it would appear as an uncharacteristic intrusion into open garden space, being a visually disruptive addition and against the pattern of the development in the local area as well as having an overbearing impact to the detriment of the amenity neighbouring occupiers contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position, excessive bulk and height and proximity to neighbouring properties, in particular with its independent use would result in loss of amenities to the exiting occupiers of the host dwelling, the neighbours and the future occupiers of the site with respect to feel of enclosure, overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
