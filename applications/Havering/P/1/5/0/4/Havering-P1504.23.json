    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and position close to the boundary with the attached neighbour at No. 31 Beechfield Gardens be an intrusive and unneighbourly form of development. It would unacceptably harm the amenity of this neighbour by contributing to sense of enclosure while reducing the the availability of light and outlook from the rear wall of the neighbour's dwelling contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent on 01/11/2023.  The revisions involved reducing the depth of the rear extension to 3m.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
