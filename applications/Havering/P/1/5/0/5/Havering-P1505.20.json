    "The proposed roof extensions would, by reason of its design, scale, height and bulk be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect which would be harmful to neighbouring properties contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
