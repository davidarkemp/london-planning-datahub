    "The layout and siting of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through poor outlook and level of light from proposed habitable rooms and an overlooked garden area; the development gives rise to a poor quality residential environment, harmful to the amenities of the future occupiers of the site.  As a result, the development would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed dwellings would, by reason of their scale, bulk, height and proximity to the neighbouring properties surrounding the site, be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the garden scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would provide an unsatisfactory arrangement for parking, pedestrian and waste access for the new dwellings, leading to an increase of on-road parking demand thereby having potential impact upon the highways safety and the adverse impact upon the free flow of traffic in the area contrary to Policy 24 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £3280 based on £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £16,400 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
