    "The proposed development would, by reason of its cumulative depth, height and the introduction of an incongruous roof design that would add more bulk to the appearance of the extensions, would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and rear garden scene harmful to the appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011).",
    "The proposed rear extensions would, by reason of the excessive depth, height and overdevelopment, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011).",
