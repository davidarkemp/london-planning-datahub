    "The proposed two storey front/side extension would, by reason of its width and proximity close to the boundary of no. 11A Abbey Wood Lane, appear as a visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, closing down the characteristic gap between properties, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed two storey front/side extension would by reason of its bulk, scale, mass and projection beyond the neighbouring property no. 15 Abbey Wood Lane, appear as an unacceptably dominant and an intrusive unneighbourly development when viewed from this neighbouring property, that would have an adverse impact on these neighbouring occupants, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £3,050 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £15,250 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 14/12/22.",
    "The proposed roof plan as shown on the drawing PL06 B indicates that the roof of the extended dwelling would marginally overhang the common boundary with no. 11A Abbey Wood Lane. Notice has not been served on this neighbour because ownership Certificate B was not signed on the application form. As the proposed developments were considered unacceptable and the application therefore refused, the occupant of no. 11A Abbey Wood Lane was not served notice about this matter. The applicant is advised that notice should be served on this neighbour in the event of a re-submitted application."
