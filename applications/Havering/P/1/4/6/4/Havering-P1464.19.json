    "The proposed radio base station, by reason of its siting, appearance and scale, would appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature on the street scene.  It is considered the development would be out of character to the locality and furthermore harmful to visual amenity.  It is considered that the intended objectives of the development could be achieved via less intrusive means and as such it is considered the proposal is contrary to Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD policies CP17, DC61, DC64 and DC66.",
