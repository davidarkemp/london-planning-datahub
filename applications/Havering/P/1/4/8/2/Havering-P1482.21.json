    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed on the approved plans and under Material Section of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Local Plan policy 26.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with Local Plan policy 34.",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy SI 5 of the London Plan.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability (London Plan (2021) Policy T5).",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally (Local Plan Policy 35).",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the local planning authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained. Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the local planning authority to verify boiler emission.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality in accordance with Policy 33 of the Local Plan.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development, details of screening to the rear inset balcony shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The screens shall not be removed without the permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate how the potential for overlooking of the rear garden areas of adjoining properties would be adequately mitigated. The agreement and implementation of appropriate level of screening prior to occupation is considered necessary in the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted is occupied, arrangements shall be agreed in writing with the local planning authority to not sell, lease, let or otherwise dispose of any dwelling unit or permit any occupation of any dwelling unit without first imposing in the relevant transfer lease, letting or occupation document a term preventing any owner or occupier of any dwelling unit from applying to the Council for a residents parking permit for the area within which the proposed development is situated.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to safeguard the amenities of surrounding residential properties and ensure minimal disruption of traffic in the locality.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "This proposal would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create one additional residential unit and would add a net additional 66sqm of residential floor space.",

    "Before occupation of the residential/commercial unit(s) hereby approved, it is a requirement to have the property/properties officially Street Named and Numbered by our Street Naming and Numbering Team.  Official Street Naming and Numbering will ensure that that Council has record of the property/properties so that future occupants can access our services.
