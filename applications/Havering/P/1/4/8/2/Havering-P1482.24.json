    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the development by virtue of its use and scale including proposed occupancy and overly intense operation would not be at odds with the suburban nature of its surroundings and resulting in undue harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers from noise and disturbance associated with the comings and goings of the use contrary to Policies 6, 7, 16 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies H12, S1 and S2 of the London Plan and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "There would be inadequate access and egress to the site, without the reliance on the adjoining site at 155 Wingletye Lane, which cannot be guaranteed in perpetuity and would result in the loss of adequate car parking and servicing arrangements at the adjacent property at 155 Wingletye Lane. It is considered that the proposed development cannot provide satisfactorily servicing and access arrangements to support the proposed use of the site and would be likely to lead to overspill parking and in the absence of scaled plans or tracking plans to demonstrate how vehicles would access, manoeuvre and exit the site in forward gear, is likely to result in highway and pedestrian safety issues. Thus, the proposal is considered unacceptable, and would not be in accordance with Policies 6, 16 & 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6 of the London Plan, and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Collins & Coward via email on 6th January 2025."
