    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of the combination of its maximum height, gabled roof design and proximity to the attached common boundary of the site, would be a visually intrusive, dominant and overbearing development that would harm the visual amenity of the occupiers of no. 22 Vaughan Avenue, contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to reduce the height of the proposed outbuilding were negotiated with the agent during the course of the application. However, the resultant bulk, scale and massing of the proposal was considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable. Further significant alteration would have been required to bring the development within the realms of acceptability so it was decided to proceed to determine the application."
