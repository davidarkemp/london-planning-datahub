    "The proposed dwelling would, by  reasons of its siting, scale, bulk, mass, height and design give rise to a cramped form of development, resulting in a development which would be materially out of keeping with that prevailing in the locality,  creating an overly intrusive and overbearing form of development when seen from the wider rear garden environment, harmful to local character and contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (adopted 2021) and policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal, having regard to the narrow access road, is able to make adequate provision for the servicing of the site, including adequate provision for refuse collection and access arrangements for emergency and rescue vehicles,  resulting in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to the provisions of Policy 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its failure to provide a safe dedicated pedestrian and cyclist access to the site and poor layout, would result in an overly cramped development to the detriment of highway safety and the residential amenity of future occupiers. The development would be contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development, by reasons of its inadequate level of privacy to the proposed private amenity space and potential increased level of noise emanating from the site to immediate surrounding neighbours, providing a constrained and sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers, which would adversely impact on their living condition, contrary to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on/adjacent site including the wildlife, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policy 27 of the Local Plan and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Council and the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £12,150. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
