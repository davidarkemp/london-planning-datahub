  "decision_conditions": [
    "The fencing, by reason of its overall height, length and prominent position against the footway, is considered to result in a visually intrusive and incongruous form of development, which is harmful to the character and appearance of the streetscene and wider area, as well has having a negative impact on the character and setting of the adjacent listed building.  The fencing fails to enhance or preserve the character of the surrounding area and is thereby contrary to the provisions of the NPPF, as well as Policies 7 and  28 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it was given to the Agent on 20th Jul 2022 who was informed via email."
