  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its narrow width, appear as visually incongruous feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of the elongated and narrow plan form of the proposed dwelling fail to make adequate provision for the amenity of future occupiers and present as a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would be to the detriment of existing and future occupiers in addition to the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive width on the boundaries of the site, unbalance the existing pair of semi-detached properties and create a terracing effect which would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the appearance of the area and amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Ark Design, via email on 07-12-20."
