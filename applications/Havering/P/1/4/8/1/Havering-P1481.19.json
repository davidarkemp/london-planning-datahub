    "The proposed development would fail to demonstrate an acceptable living environment for future occupants, through a combination of poor setting and close relationship to surrounding commercial activities and as such the arrangement would be conducive to a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its additional height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 20-11-2019"
