    "The proposal by reasons of its inadequate internal floor space, has failed to robustly demonstrate its ability to achieve a suitably high quality living environment for future occupants. Further, there is inadequate details of the managing process provided to clearly indicate that the proposal would not unduly harm the amenity of the surrounding residents, by potentially intensifying the use in particular with respect to comings and goings to the site and likelihood of high prospective turnover and occupancy in comparison to the existing use of the site as a single dwelling house. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 6, 7, 26 and 34 as well as Policies D6 and H12 of the London Plan 2021 and the objectives of the NPPF 2023.",
    "In the absence of sufficient information with respect to trip generation and the potential increase in demand for car parking in an unsustainable location together with the absence of mitigating measures to overcome any parking problem or reduction in the demand for mode of travel other than by private motor car the proposed change of use wold be likely to increased competition for on-street parking, to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding neighbouring occupiers and would contribute further to existing parking stress, thereby having adverse impact upon the free flow of traffic and the safety of highway condition,contrary to Havering Local Plan 2021 Policies 6 and 24 which seek to ensure adequate parking provision and such proposals are located in sustainable locations.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
