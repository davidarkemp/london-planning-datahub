  "decision_conditions": [
    "The application is refused as the Local Authority is unable to fully assess the merits of the proposal as the plans submitted with this application show an existing rear dormer which appears to be unlawful and a rear extension which hasn't been built in accordance with the prior approval given and differs from the details shown on the application drawings. The details shown are inaccurate and misleading to the extent that they cannot properly be determined and assessed and it is considered that the development applied for cannot be considered separately from the remainder of the development shown on the submitted drawings, particularly the rear extension to which it is attached, and the Local Authority is concerned that the development as shown on the submitted drawings would have an unacceptable visual impact and adverse impacts on the amenities of the attached neighbour.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the agent by e-mail on 18 December 2020."
