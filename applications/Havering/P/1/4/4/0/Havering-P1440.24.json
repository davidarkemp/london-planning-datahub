    "The proposal would, in the absence of any evidence otherwise, by reason of the scale of the use, opening hours late into the evening and location of the site within a predominantly residential setting, be likely to give rise to noise and disturbance caused by customers entering and leaving the premises and parking and manoeuvring of vehicles in an area with limited late-night uses, thereby unacceptably detrimental to the amenities of occupiers of adjacent properties above and within the immediate surrounds. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Para 134 of the Framework and Local Plan Policies 7, 26 and 34.",
