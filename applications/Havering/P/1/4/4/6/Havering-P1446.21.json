    "The proposed dwellings would through the constrained proportions of the site and limited plot size, design and appearance, appear as a disproportionately narrow features in the street-scene. Through limited separation from shared boundaries and scale, bulk and mass the building would read as a cramped overdevelopment of the site. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the area and prevailing pattern of development contrary to policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD with regards to the roof accommodation. There would also be conflict with Paragraph 124 of the National Planning Policy Framework which requires that development should take into account the desirability of maintaining an area's prevailing character and setting.",
    "In the absence of evidence to the contrary the scale, bulk and mass of the proposed building and close proximity to neighbouring properties in particular the unattached neighbour to the north would form a dominant and overbearing feature from inside and outside spaces, detrimental to outlook, causing an increased sense of enclosure and overbearing impact to the detriment of neighbouring occupiers contrary to the Residential Design SPD, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Paragraph 130(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework which requires that development creates places which provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
