    "The PPG states that a Section 73 application cannot be used to change the description of development. This is supported by the Court of Appeal judgement in Finney v Welsh Ministers & Ors (Rev 1) (2019) EWCA CIV 1868. The provision of a single storey rear projection and additional dormer would differ materially from the description of development on the original decision notice which cannot be varied under Section 73.",
    "The proposed extensions cumulatively required to facilitate the proposals would lack subservience and would result in a dwelling out of scale with the surrounding environment. In addition openings/fenestration and the omission of detailing present on the original property/extension would diminish the quality of the scheme as approved. The proposals are considered to be contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, having regard to the development cumulatively, the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7 and 26, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally at Para 130 that development add to the overall quality of the area and maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 21-11-2022.",

    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of Â£3225 additional over that under ref: P0821.20 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).
