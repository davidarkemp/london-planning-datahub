    "The proposed first-floor side extension would adversely affect the architectural interest of the site, and its current contribution to the Conservation Area would be diminished. As such, with regard to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. In terms of the NPPF, the proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Conservation Area by adversely affecting authentic architecture that makes a positive contribution to the designation. The proposal would therefore not comply with Policies 7, 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document nor the provisions of the NPPF, having consideration to Paragraph 208.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Gary Cumberland via email on 08/01/2025."
