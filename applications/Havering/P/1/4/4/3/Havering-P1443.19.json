  "description": "Proposed a part two-storey/part single storey side and rear extensions. Front porch extension.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive width, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Konakli (Agent) by phone and e-mail.  The revisions involved setting the first floor rear extension in from the boundary with No.27 Ashmour Gardens by 2m to comply with Council guidelines.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
