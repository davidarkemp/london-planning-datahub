    "The proposed dwelling, due to its limited size, fails to provide a suitable standard of accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space. As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policies DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of subdividing the plot and creating two separate residential curtilages, be materially harmful to the mature and spacious garden setting of the existing dwelling and appear unduly cramped, out of character with the surrounding area and result in material harm to the character and appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 of the Local Development Framework, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan and the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant on the telephone and via email on 22nd May 2018."
