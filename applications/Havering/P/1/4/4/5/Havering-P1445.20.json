    "The proposed outbuilding would, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and mass appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed outbuilding would, by reason of its height with raised decking; front elevation windows and the veranda by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties, cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
