Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on highwaysDSO@havering.gov.uk to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",

The revisions involved were sought for clarity in respect to the hardstanding. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 06/10/23 & 03/11/23."
