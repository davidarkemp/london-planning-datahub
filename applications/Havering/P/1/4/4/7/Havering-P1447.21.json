    "The use of the property as an HMO in a two storey end of terrace property and by reason of the intensification of the site, causes significant harm to residential amenity from noise, disturbance and activity contrary to Policies DC4, DC5 and DC61 of the London Borough of Havering  Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and Policy 8 of the emerging Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The property has a gross internal floor area of approximately 115 square metres, which fails to meet the standard of 120 square metres as per Policy 8 of the emerging Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and results in the loss of a small family dwelling for which there is a need.",
    "Units 2 and 3 have a floor area of 7 and 10 square metres respectively, which fails to meet the gross internal floor space of 8.5 metres for one occupier and 13 square metres for two occupiers respectively and provides a poor quality living environment for the occupiers contrary to the HMO East London Guidance 2009.  There is a recreational area in a conservatory with a floor area of 12 square metres, which could be used as a dining area, but it fails to meet the minimum standard of 16 square metres for 5 occupiers and provides a poor quality living environment for the occupiers contrary to the HMO East London Guidance 2009 and Policy 8 of the emerging Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The communal amenity space for five self-contained units create conditions that results in undue overlooking and loss of privacy to Unit 2 harmful to the amenity of the occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The 5 unit HMO results in an intensification of use and the provision of two car parking spaces for the occupiers, gives rise to increased parking stress and competition for on street parking spaces contrary to Policy DC33 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and Policy 8 of the emerging Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent email on 22nd September 2021."
