    "The London Fire Brigade has advised that it will be necessary to install one new fire hydrant. The new hydrant reference number is 106284, the location can be adjusted slightly depending on where the water main is laid, however a change in location must be first agreed by the London Fire Brigade. If there is a private main to be run to this development, then it would be a private hydrant. The installation cost for this private hydrant will be the responsibility of the developer and the ongoing future maintenance and repairs will be the responsibility of the site owner or management company. Each private hydrant should be tested and maintained annually. The hydrant should be sited within a footpath - not a grass verge, flower bed, carriageway or parking area. The applicant is advised to liaise with the London Fire Brigade regarding the provision of a fire hydrant on the site."
