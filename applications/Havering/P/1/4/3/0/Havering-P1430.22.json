    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",

    "b. Upon completion of installation, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gases (methane and carbon dioxide).

    "https://www.havering.gov.uk/info/20013/environmental_issues/127/hazards_pollution_and_flooding",
    "Party Wall Informative",
