    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials as annotated on drawing umber 86-05004 rev 2 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "No goods or materials shall be stored on the site in the open without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of visual amenity, and that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive property shall not exceed as expressed in the associated \"plant noise assessment report July 2021. Plant and machinery shall be maintained thereafter in accordance with the approved scheme.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to assess the noise levels of the plant or machinery to be used on site. Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use, will prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties in accordance with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC55 and DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Notwithstanding the drawing hereby approved, the scheme only relates to the storage element of the commercial building and would not relate to any other part of the building.",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
