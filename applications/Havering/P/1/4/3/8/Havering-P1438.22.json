    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "This permission shall be for a limited period only expiring on 7 September 2025 or until the use of the site for the rearing and breeding of pigs ceases, whichever date is the earlier, on or before which date the mobile home, decking and modular unit hereby permitted shall be removed from the site in their entirety and the site reinstated to its former condition to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt, where development is only permitted in very special circumstances, therefore on the expiry of this permission, the Council will wish to review the need for accommodation and ancillary modular unit in the light of the viability of the enterprise at that time.",
    "The mobile home hereby permitted shall only be occupied by the person(s) employed in the rearing and breeding of pigs undertaken in Hubbards Chase Piggery and their immediate family.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt in an area where the Local Planning Authority would not normally grant",
    "permission for such development, and this permission is granted solely to meet a need associated with the permitted use of the site for the rearing and breeding of pigs.",
    "The permission hereby granted shall be personal to Ms T. Mackness only, and shall not enure for the benefit of the land or any other person.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Permission is only granted in view of the particular circumstances and the competence of the applicant.",
    "The modular unit hereby permitted shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 09:00AM and 15:00PM on Mondays to Fridays and not at all on Saturdays, Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to installation of the demountable unit in the location shown on approved drawings details of surface water drainage shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Surface water drainage shall then be provided in accordance with the approved details nd maintained thereafter for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Surface water drainage works are required on site to prevent the risk of flooding.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "With regards to the time limit, it is reasonable, on balance, given that earlier consent had not been implemented to extend the time period in line with the new decision being issued."
