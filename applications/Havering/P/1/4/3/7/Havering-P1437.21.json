    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed windows on the flank wall next the the neighbour at no.8 Ernest Road shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than Level 3 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained and permanently fixed shut.",

The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
