    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its poor design in terms of the lack of set down from the ridge height of the main dwelling and also the lack of set back to the side extension at first floor level from the main elevation of the dwelling would contribute to a terracing effect causing it not to appear suitably subservient to the host property. Given its prominence in the street scene the side extension would cause the original dwelling to appear bulky and out of character with the immediate area harmful to the appearance of the both the host dwelling and the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed boundary treatment, by reason of its excessive height, scale and poor design would introduce a design element which is inconsistent with the established low rise form of development to boundaries of properties in the street scene. This would add a design element which is incongruous with other properties along St Neots Road to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to support the application such that it is unclear whether the proposed boundary treatment would provide a suitable arrangement for vehicles to safety ingress and egress from the property. The 1.5m pillars would likely inhibit views when vehicles egress from the site creating an unsafe environment for pedestrians and other vehicles contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking further amendments beyond those initially requested, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 01/12/2023."
