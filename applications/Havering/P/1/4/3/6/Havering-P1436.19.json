    "The access by way of its width length and sight distances is unsatisfactory for emergency purposes and would create an unsafe living environment for future occupiers and contrary to Policy 7.13 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties as well as the likely loss of existing mature and semi-mature trees, cause overlooking and loss of privacy, noise and disturbance from the carrying of daily life as well as traffic arriving manoeuvring on and leaving the site, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
