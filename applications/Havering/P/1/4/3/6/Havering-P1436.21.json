    "The proposed use through the scale of the business operation and proximity to neighbouring residential dwellings would result in unacceptable levels of noise and disturbance to the detriment of residential amenity and would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 23, and 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-203 as well as paragraph 130 of the NPPF which requires developments to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
    "The proposed cattery by reason of the introduction of a commercial use within a residential environment, site layout and scale of the business use would be harmful to and would fundamentally alter the residential character of the locality and result in an intensification of the use of the site beyond that acceptable within a residential environment contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Paragraph 130 of the NPPF which amongst other things requires development add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character. In addition there would be conflict with London Plan 2021 Policy D3 which requires that development enhance local context.",
    "The proposed use through the absence of any evidence to the contrary would fail to make adequate provision for the increased trip generation and vehicle movement associated with the business operation which would lead to increased parking stress and increased competition for on-street parking spaces and is therefore contrary to Polices 7, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also London Plan 2021 Policy T6.",
