    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at no. 23 Glenton Close, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed detached annexe, would by reason of its functional separation from the main dwelling, large size and siting, represent an overdevelopment in the rear garden environment which is inconsistent with the prevailing open character of the rear garden scene and pattern of development, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed detached annexe would be functionally separate from the main house, with its own garden and independent access, resulting in additional comings and goings, noise and disturbance and would be out of character, resulting in an acceptable impact to amenity, contrary to DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the agent."
