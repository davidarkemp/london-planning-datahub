    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the subject property would provide a suitable layout for future occupants and staff, in particular in regard of matters relating to suitability and quality nor has it been considered fully how the premises might be further adapted in the future, having regard to the ground floor layout. The proposals are considered to be at odds in principle with the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 6, specifically subsections 6(v), 6(vi) and 6(vii).",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the development by virtue of its use and scale including proposed occupancy/levels of staffing would not be at odds with the suburban nature of its surroundings and would not result in undue harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers through comings and goings, turnover of staff and residents in a manner distinguishable from the use of the property as a single dwelling house. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 6, 7, 24, and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policies H12 of the London Plan as well as the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "The site is not well served by public transport. The applicant has not demonstrated that proposed use would not lead to increased comings and goings to the site over and above that of a single dwelling house and that an adequate degree of visitor and carer parking facilities would be provided as well as those for future occupants who may own vehicles and staff. Therefore as a consequence this would result in an adverse impact on the safety and convenience of the local highway network through exacerbating pedestrian-vehicular conflict along pavements and traffic congestion within the area. As such there would be conflict with Policy 6 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policy T6 of the London Plan as well as the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 17-01-2025"
