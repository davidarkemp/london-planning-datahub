    "The proposed extension and conversion would result in an outbuilding, by reason of its excessive height, bulk and scale fail to appear subservient to the main dwelling and instead appearing to replicate an independent dwelling in its own right detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the streetscene. The resultant outbuilding would also unacceptably introduce a crown roof form which would detract from the character of the neighbouring dwelling at No. 10 Deveron Way and add an incongruous element to the detriment of the wider street scene contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
