    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Rawal by phone and e-mail.  The revisions involved to ensure that the proposal did not infringe upon the notional line from the boundary to overcome amenity concerns.  The changes made did not overcome these concerns raised."
