    "The proposed extension through its scale, bulk and mass would form a visually prominent and intrusive feature with a harmful affect on the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and Conservation Area. It would also through the cumulative impacts of hard-standing and buildings contribute to a sprawling layout which would conflict with the objectives of the Garden Suburb. As such the development would fail to preserve the character or appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The development would conflict with policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the objectives of the NPPF. The development also fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Gidea Park Conservation Area, therefore contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 12-05-2022."
