  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, in particular the side extension would, by reason of the cumulative width, bulk, mass and cramped appearance completely overwhelm the original character of the host property and unacceptably unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached house. The development would represent an overdevelopment of the site that would significantly reduce the characteristic visual gap between dwellings and would appear as a dominant, visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Neil Rouse via email on 24/11/2020."
