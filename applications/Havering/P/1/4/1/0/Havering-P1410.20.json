    "The proposed development would, by reason of its cramped plot, site positioning, bulk, mass and design, combined with its proximity to the side and rear boundaries of the site, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street and garden scene harmful to the prevailing character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Due to the proposed parking not being demonstrated as being insufficient to accommodate likely parking requirements of the development, it is likely that on-street parking would occur which would be detrimental to free flow of traffic on Nelson Road, contrary to Policy DC2 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Submission Development Plan Document",
