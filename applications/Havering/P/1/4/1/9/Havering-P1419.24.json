    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason: In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 there shall be no new or replacement boundary treatment unless of an equivalent height or lower than existing unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "To preserve the open character of the site and to protect the visual amenities of the development.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the accommodation in the roof hereby approved, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason: To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The curtilage of  \"The Bungalow\" including areas of acess, parking and amenity provision shall not encroach beyond the red-line boundary shown on drawing no. 02 Rev C received 15-01-2025 and the layout of parking/amenity provision shall be only as shown on plan unless express permission from the Local Planning Authority is sought.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of  limiting impacts on the Metropolitan Green Belt and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse, nor any detached building with a floor area of greater than 30 square metres gross floorspace (measured externally), or laying of additional areas of hard-standing (other than those shown on drawing no. 02 Rev C received 15-01-2025) without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent/applicant in writing. The revisions involved a change to the description of development to include the use of  \"the Bungalow\" as a single dwelling house. This was agreed 17-12-2024. Further to this a revised plan was received 15-01-2025 which demonstrated how parking would be achieved."
