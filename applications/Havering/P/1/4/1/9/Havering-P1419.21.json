    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 14 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "The front extensions hereby approved at No's 2 and 4 Hamilton Drive are to be undertaken as one building operation in strict accordance with drawings 'ZAAVIA/2HD/504 RevA, ZAAVIA/2HD/505 RevA, ZAAVIA/2HD/507 RevA, ZAAVIA/2HD/508 RevA and ZAAVIA/2HD/510 RevA'  and the extensions are to be substantially completed at the rear of both properties in their entirety, simultaneously.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that a partially completed development would not undermine the existing uniformity and visual symmetry of the terrace to the rear and would not result in an incongruous and incompatible form of development, harming the character and appearance of the adjoining terrace row and the surrounding area.

Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
