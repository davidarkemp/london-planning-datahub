    "The site is within the area identified in the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances.  The outbuilding proposed would result in disproportionate additions to the property over and above its original form and would also by way of the overall bulk and amount of development, reduce and therefore cause harm to the openness of the Green Belt. The development proposals are therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 a",
