    "The proposed development would by reason of its form and massing and the relationship with no.258 Brentwood Road and no.2a Osbourne Road would result in a discordant building form and cramped form of development, would be unacceptable and uncharacteristic for the area, and would adversely impact the character and appearance of the locality and the established pattern of development, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its bulk and mass and close relationship to the shared boundary with no.256 and no.258 Brentwood Road and no.2a Osbourne Road would result in loss of light, overshadowing and an visually intrusive feature with an overbearing impact to the detriment of their amenity and the enjoyment of their rear garden environment contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal would lead to poor quality outlook from a habitable room to the detriment of the future occupiers, contrary to the aims of Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1867.50  based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £9394.27 based on calculation of £125.76 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
