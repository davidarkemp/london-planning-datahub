  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would diminish the spacious qualities of the Conservation Area and present as a cramped form of development entirely at odds with prevailing local character and the existing pattern of development and would therefore neither preserve nor enhance the special character of the Conservation Area. The development sought is therefore contrary to Policies DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Heritage SPD and the guidance contained within the NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its limited separation from the boundaries of the site and scale, bulk and mass, present as an intrusive and overbearing feature and would give rise to unacceptable levels of overlooking to the detriment of the amenity of the occupiers of the donor property contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL2) and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) respectively at a rate of £25 per sqm and £125 per sqm of new gross internal floor area respectively.",
    "Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £11,850.",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
