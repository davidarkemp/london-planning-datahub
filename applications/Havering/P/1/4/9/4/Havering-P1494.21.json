    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and orientation and proximity to neighbouring properties cause an increased sense of overlooking and loss of privacy to neighbour No 34 Rowan Walk and cause overshadowing and sense of enclosure to neighbour No 81 Haynes Road which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 7 of the emerging Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposal, due to the location of the vehicle cross over proposed for the new dwelling on the southern side of the application site, would result in vehicles entering/leaving the site in reverse gear which is considered to be dangerous and would be detrimental to the safety of other road users and pedestrians, contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF and Policy 23 of the emerging Havering Local Plan.",
