    "The proposed pair of semi-detached dwellings would, by reason of their bulk, scale, mass, roof and fenestration design as well as the resultant loss of a substantial amount trees and landscaping within the application site, appear as an incongruous form of development along Homeway that would be out of character with the surrounding environment. These proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed pair of semi-detached dwellings would, by reason of their inadequate bedroom sizes and limited floor-to-ceiling heights and storage space, result in dwellings of a low quality design that would be to the detriment of future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted as part of the application for the ecological impacts of the proposed pair of semi-detached dwellings to be assessed, contrary to Policies 10 and 27 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed car parking layout for the proposed pair of semi-detached dwellings, specifically the location of the vehicular crossover for unit 02 would, by reason of its proximity close to the nearby junction, result in an unsatisfactory parking arrangement which would be detrimental to safety of pedestrians and other road users, contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process, the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) contribution of £6,500 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL (HCIL) contribution of £32,500 (x £125 per sqm)",
