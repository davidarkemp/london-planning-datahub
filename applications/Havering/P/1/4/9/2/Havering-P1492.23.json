    "The proposed building due to the constrained plot size and resultant limited separation from shared boundaries, position forward of the established front building line of dwellings fronting Manser Road and proximity to the back edge of the footway would present as an incongruous feature in the street-scene, detrimental to the established residential character of Manser Road. The proposals would fail to comply with Policies 16 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, London Plan Policies D4 and S1 and the Framework, in particular Para 128 which requires evelopment maintain an area's prevailing character and setting.",
    "In the absence of any evidence compelling evidence otherwise the proposed use is likely to generate activity and disturbance through comings, goings, noise and vehicle movement distinguishable from other activities within Manser Road to the detriment of neighbouring amenity and therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 16 and 34, London Plan S1 and the Framwork in particular Para 135 which amongst other considerations requires development provide a high standard of amenity.",
    "In the absence of any evidence otherwise and owing to the nature of the proposed use and potential intensity throughout it has not been evidenced to the satisfaction of the LPA that there would not be a material impact on the functioning of the highway or that the cumulative impacts would not be severe. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 16,  23 and 24 which seek amongst other things to ensure adequate parking provision is made and that no unacceptable impacts on highway safety, especially in regards to pedestrians and cyclists would occur. Further to this there would be conflict with Para 115 of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 02-02-2024.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,875 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre (115 SQM).",
