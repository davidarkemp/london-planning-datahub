    "The proposed dwelling would be detrimental to the street-scene as it would through its combined scale, bulk and mass and proximity to the boundaries of the site appear as a visually dominant and incongruous development which would detract from the spacious character of the corner location. Furthermore through the design concept progressed the proposed dwelling would disrupt the rhythm of the terraced row and would fail to reflect the character of the terraced row, reading as a conspicuously narrow dwelling with a constrained frontage. The proposals are considered to be contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7 and 26, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally at Para 130 that development add to the overall quality of the area and maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 1 December 2023.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1162.50 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £5812.50 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
