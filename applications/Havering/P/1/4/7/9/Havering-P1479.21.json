    "The proposed development would, by reason of its cumulative depth, position and close proximity to the neighbouring properties have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD Adopted 2008, and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
