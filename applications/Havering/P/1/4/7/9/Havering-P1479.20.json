  "description": "Subdivision of existing dwelling to create new two storey, two-bedroom end terrace dwelling.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would, by reason of its disruption to the established building line along Abberton Walk and reduction in space between properties that is characteristic of the developments either side of the walkway, would result in an incongruous feature out of character with the prevailing pattern of development as well as the loss of the important visual separation between properties to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, depth and close proximity to neighbouring dwellings on Abberton Walk, result in an overbearing and dominant development that would be unneighbourly resulting in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure detrimental to the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development in the absence of information to the contrary, would, by reason of the inadequate off street car parking provision, result in an unacceptable impact to the highways with the potential for overspill onto adjoining roads and would detrimentally impact future occupiers and surrounding residents, contrary to the Policy DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 6.13 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £2,455  and the Havering CIL payable would be £12,275 . Therefore a total CIL contribution of £14,730  would be payable. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "It is noted that no CIL form was supplied with the planning application. CIL is subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to the agent via email."
