    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To accord with objectives relating to amenity and to ensure that works proposed are not a nuisance.",
    "Before the proposed extension hereby permitted is first occupied, provision shall be made within the site for 12 additional car parking spaces in the arrangement shown on drawing no. 22-109-/06 and thereafter this additional provision (and existing) shall be made permanently available for use, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that adequate car parking provision is made off street in the interests of highway safety.",
    "Before the proposed extension hereby permitted is first occupied, the applicant shall submit for the approval of the Local Planning Authority details of the gated access to serve the parking to the western part of the site where new vehicular access is proposed. Such measures as agreed shall then be installed within a period of three months and maintained thereafter for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: -",
    "In the interests of visual amenity and for the avoidance of any doubt.",
    "The additional floor-space hereby permitted shall only be used in connection with the existing use of the site and at no time shall form a separate use or business operation.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the objectives of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, in paticular those given at Policy 19.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied to determine the appropriateness of the arrangement shown on drawings submitted. Submission of further detail prior to occupation in the case of new extension is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car users and sustainability.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
