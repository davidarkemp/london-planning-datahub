    "The proposed 1-bedroom annex, which would function as a self-contained residential unit within the application site, would by reason of its limited floor-to-ceiling heights and storage space result in a unit of accomodation that would be of a low quality design and therefore detrimental to future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed 1-bedroom annex, as a result of functioning as a self-contained residential unit within the application site, would not correspond with the local pattern of development of domestic and ancillary outbuildings within rear gardens of the locality and would also result in additional comings and goings associated with the independent use of the building, which would have an unacceptable impact upon the character and appearance of the surrounding area and amenity of the adjoining neighbours respectively, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent Craig Pallet via email on 14/02/2025."
