  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until one cycle storage space is provided in accordance with details in plan P-001. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter and is required to be enclosed and lockable.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details in plan P-001. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be located 2 metres to the south to avoid obstructing the pedestrian gate and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted commences details of a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority which specifies the provisions to be made for the control of noise and odours  effecting the site, principally nearby commercial activities. Such scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise and odour  nuisance to future residents/occupants.",
    "The building(s) shall be so constructed as to provide sound insulation of 43 DnT,w + Ctr dB (minimum values) against airborne noise and 64 L'nT,w dB (maximum values) against impact noise to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development an assessment shall be undertaken of the impact of road noise emanating from Collier Row Road  upon the development in accordance with the methodology contained in the Department of Transport/Welsh office memorandum, \"Calculation of Road Traffic Noise\", 1988. Reference should be made to the good standard to be found in the World Health Organisation Document number 12 relating to community noise and BS8233:1999.   Following this, a scheme detailing measures, which are to protect occupants from road traffic noise shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall be implemented prior to occupation.",
    "Reason:  To protect future residents against the impact of road noise.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email on 10/12/20. The revisions involved reduction in occupancy from 2 persons to 1 person and provision of waste and cycle storage. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 10/12/20.",
    "Before occupation of the residential/ commercial unit(s) hereby approved, it is a requirement to have the property/properties officially Street Named and Numbered by our Street Naming and Numbering Team.  Official Street Naming and Numbering will ensure that that Council has record of the property/properties so that future occupants can access our services.  Registration will also ensure that emergency services, Land Registry and the Royal Mail have accurate address details.  Proof of having officially gone through the Street Naming and Numbering process may also be required for the connection of utilities. For further details on how to apply for registration see:",
