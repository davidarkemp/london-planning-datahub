    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 the outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house including storage and equipment/use for physiotherapy of the one of the occupiers and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation.",

    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area.",
    "Within 3 months of the date of this decision, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out suitable gas protection measures to be employed on the site. This could include, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable gas resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015+A1:2019, alternative gas protection measures, or suitable monitoring agreed in writing with the local planning authority, to demonstrate that the risk from landfill gas is adequately controlled.  The submitted details shall include a timeframe for the carrying out of the approved measures. The  gas protection measures shall then be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and the approved timeframe for undertaking those works.",

    "For any development where a flood risk is identified, the Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority want to see developers consider and implement flood resilience/resistance measures into the buildings themselves. This is not to stop development but to ensure the protection for future residents is maintained and enhanced.",
    "The following measures are strongly recommended, although this list is not exhaustive:-",
    "-         Raising the level of the building by at least 300mm above local levels;",
    "-         Waterproof membrane in the ground floor;",
    "-         Waterproof plaster and waterproofing to ground floor;",
    "-         Electrics from the upstairs down and sockets high up off the ground floor;",
