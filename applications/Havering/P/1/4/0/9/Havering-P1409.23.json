    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive width and depth, bulk and roof form with its lack of subservience and being disproportionate to the existing dwelling, would introduce an incongruous built form which  would be an unsympathetic and be a visually intrusive development which would not preserve or enhance the special character of this part of the Cranham Conservation Area contrary to Policies 26 & 28 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 & HC1 of the London Plan and the NPPF.",
    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing open character of the area so allocated and that the new buildings will only be permitted in certain circumstances. The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass would result in a disproportionate addition that would cause harm to the openness of the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case. The development proposals are therefore contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Stephenson by phone on the 21st November 2023."
