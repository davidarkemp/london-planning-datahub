    "The proposed development would give rise to the loss of a family sized dwelling.  Moreover, the replacement dwellings would give rise to poor quality living accommodation, failing to demonstrate sufficient internal head height exists for the upper floor flat and failing to provide access to outdoor amenity space for the family unit.  In addition, the outdoor amenity space would be of an insufficient size to accommodate the likely needs of occupants and would not guarantee a satisfactory level of privacy. As such, the proposed development will not provide a suitable, sustainable and quality living accommodation for its future occupants.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan, and Policies 7 and 9 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development, fails to demonstrate that adequate provision can be made for car parking, cycle storage and storage of refuse awaiting collection for the all occupiers of the proposed development.  The proposal would therefore fail to achieve a suitably high standard of design, creating conditions detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers and likely to result in an adverse impact on the functioning of the highway in Knighton Road, contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The roof alterations and rear dormer by virtue of their combined size, scale and bulk is considered not to be subservient to the roof of the host dwelling house, appear incongruous and out of keeping with the street scene and character of the area detrimental to the visual amenities when viewed from the rear gardens of neighbouring properties, contrary to the design guidance outlined within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent via email on 10th Feb 2023."
