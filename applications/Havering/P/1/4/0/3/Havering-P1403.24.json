    "Construction of the extensions hereby granted consent shall not be commenced until a schedule of the types and colour of the materials to be used in the external finishes has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details.  Prior to their instillation on-site, additional drawings that show details of proposed new windows, doors, facia and sills to be used by section and elevation at scales between 1:20 and 1:1 as appropriate have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Works shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details and shall be permanently maintained as such.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email on 9.12.24.  The revisions involved a reduction in the height of the extension. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 17.12.24."
