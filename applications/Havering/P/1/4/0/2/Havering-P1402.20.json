    "The proposed development would by reason of the resulting excessive width, height, lack of subservience and awkward design appear incongruous, in a prominent location and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and front street scene detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality in contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of the bulk, mass and scale unbalances the pair of semi-detached dwelling which would be visually harmful to the character of the street scene in contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed single storey side / rear extensions would, by reason of its excessive width, height, bulk and proximity to the boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, loss of privacy, loss of light and be harmful to neighbouring property no. 6 Priests Avenue in contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Ms Vicky Tate via email on 19th November 2020."
