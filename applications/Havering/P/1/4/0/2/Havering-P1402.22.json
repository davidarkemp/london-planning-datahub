In addition, the potential loss of the existing hedges together with the extent of the existing unauthorised front/side hard surfacing would set an undesirable precedent, detrimental to the open and verdant character of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposal would neither preserve nor enhance the character and appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area contrary to Policies 26, 27 and 28 of the Local Plan 2021 and Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document (adopted 2011) and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
