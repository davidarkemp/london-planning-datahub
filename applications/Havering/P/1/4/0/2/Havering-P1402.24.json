    "It is considered that the proposed outbuilding would be inappropriate development through failing to comply with any of the given exceptions at Paragraph 154 of the National Planning Policy Framework (Dec 24). No VSC case has been made which outweighs the in principle and other harm identified through the scale, bulk and mass and resultant impact on openness. The development is therefore in conflict with the objectives of the NPPF including the purposes of including land within the Green Belt and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The scale, bulk and mass of the outbuilding in conjunction with its close relationship to the main dwelling would fail to respect the primacy of the Listed Building. The scheme as a whole would therefore fail to contribute positively to the local character and distinctiveness, as required by Paragraph 203(f) of the NPPF as well as being contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 28, London Plan Policy HC1 and the objectives of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (in particular sections 16, 66 and 72).",
    "Insufficient consideration has been given to the location of the application site within a SINC as it has not been been demonstrated that the proposals would not adversely impact on protected species. It is considered that a Preliminary Ecological Appraisal and Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment are each required. The proposals therefore fail to comply with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 30 which amongst other considerations requires that the impact of proposals on protected sites and species has been fully assessed when development has the potential to impact on such sites or species.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 31-01-2025."
