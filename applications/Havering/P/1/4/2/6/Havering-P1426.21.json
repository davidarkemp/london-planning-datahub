    "The proposed rear/side extension would, by reason of its excessive width, depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as creating an oppressive boundary which would have an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 7 of the Draft Local Plan.",
    "The proposed rear/side extension by reason of its excessive width, depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site would fail to be subordinate or in keeping with architectural design of the host building and would appear as an overly bulky structure and appear out of proportion to the host dwelling when viewed from adjoining sites and also from the adjoining street of Plough Rise contrary to Policy DC61, Draft Local Plan policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
