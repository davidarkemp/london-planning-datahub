    "The proposed development would fail to provide adequate internal and external space for future occupants, in conflict with the indoor and outdoor space standards outlined in Policy D6, including Criteria 1, of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7 the Havering Local Plan 2016-2033, which would result in substandard residential accommodation detrimental to the amenity of the future residents.",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the noise impact. In the absence of this information, it is therefore considered that the proposed development use would, by reason of its location and relationship to nearby sensitive receptors, in particular the amenity of future residents to the proposed appartment, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance from the ventilation equipment associated with the use and potential odour from cooking smell which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring and future occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 34.",
    "In the absence of a sufficient Waste Management Plan, it has not been demonstrated that waste can be disposed of on a street that already has issues with fly tipping and waste presentation. Therefore, the proposal cannot demonstrate that adequate provision for waste collection can be provided against Policy 35 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2035.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Thamir Alqatrani via email on 22/11/2024."
