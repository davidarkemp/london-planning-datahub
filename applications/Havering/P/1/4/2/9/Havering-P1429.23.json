    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed within the supporting statement submitted as part of the application unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The model trainset shall only be used within the operating hours of Lodge Farm Park.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To minimise the impact of the development on the surrounding area in the interests of amenity.",
    "The noise level from the proposed train, and other equipment shall not exceed [5]dBA above the background levels determined at all boundaries near to noise-sensitive premises, in accordance to the current version of British Standard 4142 and shall be adhered to thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development hereby permitted is not detrimental to the amenity of the surrounding area by reason of undue noise emission and/or unacceptable disturbance, as there is insufficient information within the submitted application.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
