    "The proposed change of use of the upper floor of the public house to a hotel (Use Class C1) would limit the operational flexibility of the pub as it would redevelop and result in the loss of associated staff accommodation which would compromise the operation and long term viability of the public house use contrary to London Plan (2021) policy HC7.",
    "The application has failed to demonstrate through a sequential test that no suitable sites are (or are expected to become) available within town centre or edge of centre locations for the proposed hotel (use class C1) contrary to the Mayors town centre first approach. The proposal would result in out-of-centre development detrimental to Romford Town Centre undermining its economic performance, local character, and the accessibility it provides to a broad range of services, and would encourage increased trips by car contrary to Draft Local Plan policy 13, London Plan (2021) Policies SD7 and ED10 and paragraphs 87 and 88 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 29/09/21."
