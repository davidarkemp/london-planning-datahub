  "description": "Single storey rear extension, single storey front extension, conversion of roof space to habitable use involving conversion of roof from hip to gable end and to include a rear dormer and 3 front roof lights. Erection of single storey detached building to rear for use as garden studio.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed loft conversion including the hip to gable roof alteration and rear dormer, would unbalance the symmetry of this pair of semi-detached properties and appear as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive features to the detriment of the character of the host property and street scene, as well as to the visual amenity enjoyed from adjoining properties and their rear gardens, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive cumulative depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development, resulting in an overbearing impact and a significant loss of outlook and overshadowing to the detriment of the amenity of the occupiers of no.32 Prestwood Drive, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD."
