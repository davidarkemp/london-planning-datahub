    "Prior to first use of the terrace hereby permitted, a screening panel shall be installed on the terrace in accordance with details previously submitted to and agreed by the Local Planning Authority. Following installation, the screening panel shall remain in place permanently.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwellings, and in order that the development accords with the Local Plan Policy 7.",

    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
    "A free guide called \"The Party Wall Etc Act 1996: Explanatory Booklet\" is available on the website of the Department for Communities and Local Government.",

    "This scheme has been considered with respect to the proposed physical alterations only. The space is currently used for storage ancillary to the commercial premises at the ground floor area, and the application has been considered on this basis.  Any proposed future alternative use of the building may require planning permission or it would be for the applicant to demonstrate, potentially through an application for a Certificate of Lawful Use, that an alternative use would not require planning permission."
