    "The proposed rear garden would not provide sufficient and a high quality useable amenity space for future occupiers of the parent assessment unit contrary to Policies 6 and 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy H12 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Non-compliance with Secured by Design principles, in the absence of any evidence otherwise, would present a risk to future occupiers of the parent assessment unit. The proposals are therefore in conflict with Policy 6 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 which amongst other considerations requires that specialist accommodation is suitable for the intended occupants. Furthermore there would be conflict with the objectives of Policies D11 and H12 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework, which specifically at Paragraph 135 requires that developments create places that are safe, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users and where crime and disorder, and the fear of crime, do not undermine the quality of life or community cohesion and resilience.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Visionary Planning UK via email on 24th January 2025."
