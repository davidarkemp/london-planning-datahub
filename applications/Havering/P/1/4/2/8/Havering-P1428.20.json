The submitted scheme is expected to make provision for planting to the front and side boundaries of the site of a height and type that will provide a sufficient privacy screen to the garden areas of the ground floor units within the development. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless othe",

The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
