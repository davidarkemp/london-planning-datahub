    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive width on the boundaries of the site, unbalance the existing pair of semi-detached properties and create a terracing effect which would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the appearance of the area and amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
