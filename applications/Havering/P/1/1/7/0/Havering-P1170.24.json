    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "In the event that the appeal of P0711.24 is unsuccessful, the rear dormer hereby approved shall be erected within two months of the date of that appeal decision.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The unauthorised dormer window by reason of its bulk, scale and mass, appears out of scale and character with the dwelling and is materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document. Hence it would be necessary to carry out the proposed amendments to safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on submitted drawings accompanying the application, the face and cheeks of the rear dormer window hereby approved shall be tile hung to match the appearance of the roof of the dwelling house unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email on 13/01/2025. The revisions involved reducing the width of the proposed rear dormer. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 13/01/2025.",
    "The applicant should note that if the appeal of P0711.24 is unsuccessful and the rear dormer approved as part of this application is not erected within two months of the date of that appeal decision as required by Condition 2, enforcement action may be taken."
