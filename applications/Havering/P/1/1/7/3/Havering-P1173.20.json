    "The proposed extension to the front of the house would, by reason of its protrusion forward of the main building line and partially obscuring the front bay window, be out of character in the streetscape and unbalance the symmetry between the semi-detached pair, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposed side/rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at no.165 Argyle Gardens, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011)and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to Mr Malik Awan (agent), via email on 13 October 2020."
