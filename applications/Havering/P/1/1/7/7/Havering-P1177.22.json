    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",

    "The roof lights inserted on the roof slope of either side of the dwelling house adjacent to Nos.25A and 27 Herbert Road, Hornchurch shall be obscure-glazed to a minimum of level 3, and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7m above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.",
    "Reason - In the interest of privacy and to protect the amenity of the adjacent neighbours.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on drawing no 6991/21B accompanying the application, the face and cheeks of the front and rear dormer windows shall be tile hung to match the appearance of the roof of the existing dwelling unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Jaffa (agent) by e-mail.

The amendments were subsequently submitted on 09-09-22 and 12-09-22."
