It would be contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the advice given in the NPPF which states that new development should conserve and enhance local character and respect the surrounding built environment, respond to local character and add to the overall qualities of an area and the guidance contained within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed annexe extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
