    "The lack of direct access to amenity space for the proposed flats and lack of any individual private space for those flats, in particular the larger 2 bed unit, would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the position and proximity of the proposed first floor rear windows to  neighbouring properties and their rear gardens at No.'s 33 and 33A Station Road, cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed flats 1 and 2 would be reliant on flank windows to serve the proposed bedrooms.  These windows, as the sole windows to the bedroom in each flat, are not considered suitable to be obscure glazed and therefore by reason of the proposed internal layout, siting and proximity to the flank wall of No. 29 Station Road, result in substandard accommodation for future residents through poor outlook, limited light, inter-looking and loss of privacy, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
