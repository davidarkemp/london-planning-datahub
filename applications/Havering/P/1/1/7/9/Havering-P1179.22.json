    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Policies 7 and 26.",
    "The provision and retention of cycle storage for both the commercial and residential unit as indicated on drawing Nos. A101 SHEET 01 R0 and A105 SHEET 05 R0 shall be provided prior to the occupation of the hereby approved development and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents, in the interests of sustainability.",
    "The proposed side access to the commercial aspect of the development shall only be used to access the cycle storage and for emergency purposes only.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interest of highways safety.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, provision shall be made within the site for car parking in accordance with the approved plans, thereafter such provision shall be made permanently available for use, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "The ground floor office use hereby permitted shall not be in use other than between the hours of 0800hrs and 1800hrs on Mondays to Saturdays and not at all on Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity.",
    "The window inserted on the rearmost elevation shall be  obscure-glazed, and  non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7m above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.",
    "Reason - In the interest of privacy and to protect the amenity of neighbours.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "(1) a) If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b) Following completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason: To ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the applicant/agent, via emails, phone calls/meeting at various times since on 22/09/2022 till date (29/09/2022). The revisions involved omission Omission of the proposed conversion of the first floor to a small HMO; reduction in the width of the first floor rear extension; reduction in the height of the side roof and changing the flat roof to pitch; relocation of the cycles and refuse bins; reinstate the side access for the flat above to the side and the omission of the additional door to the side for the proposed office. The final amendments were subsequently submitted on 29/09/2022."
