  "description": "Erection of two storey 2-bed detached dwelling house with associated parking and amenity space.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would - by reason of its form, massing, appearance, prominent siting in relation to No.258 Brentwood Road, as well as its siting within the plot and distances from the boundary - result in a cramped form of development, would be unacceptable and uncharacteristic for the area, and would adversely impact on visual amenity in the street scene, the amenity of the donor property, and the area more generally. Consequently, the proposed development would be unacceptable when assessed against the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended], policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP),  policies DC3 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Residential Design SPD 2010.",
    "The proposed development would - through an inappropriate access arrangement and impact on the adjacent highways / roadside tree - fail to provide adequately designed off-street parking, and would rely on works beyond the site (including the removal or the long-term and irrevocable degradation and damage to an otherwise high quality tree) to make the development acceptable. Consequently, the overall parking layout / arrangement would be detrimental to the safety of pedestrians and other road users, and would be unacceptable when assessed against the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended], policies 6.13, 6.9, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.21 of the London Plan MALP 2016, and policies DC3, DC33, DC35, DC61 and DC62 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Residential Design SPD 2010 and the Protection of Trees During Development SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy and that it is not clear if the reasons for refusal could be overcome due to site limitations, it was considered necessary to assess the application within the statutory timeframes, in line with the expectations under paragraph 47 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended].",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) this application proposes a new residential unit, and an increase in floorspace by 84sqm in area. The site lies in the Havering north charging CIL area, and therefore would have a Havering CIL liability of £10,500 and a Mayoral CIL liability of £2,100; subject to indexation.",
