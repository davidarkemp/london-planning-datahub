Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed and subject to confirmation that no damage will be caused to the street tree in close proximity to the dropped kerb.",
    "If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence."
