    "The proposed development by reason of its scale and bulk would unacceptably compromise the architectural view from the garden scene, given the relatively short gardens to the neighbours to the rear. Furthermore, the proposed development would appear as overbearing structure that would therefore appear dominant and visually intrusive, harmful to the host dwelling, street and garden scene and the character of the area contrary to the Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy 26 of the Local Plan.",
