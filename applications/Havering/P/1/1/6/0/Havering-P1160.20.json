    "The proposed extension by reason of its cumulative scale, bulk and incongruous crown roof form would unacceptably unbalance the appearance of these properties and would appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear environment. It would also unacceptably compromise the architectural composition of the building, in particular the proposed two storey rear extension would dominate the existing two storey outrigger to the rear which form the main feature in the rear elevation contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the London Borough of Havering's  Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011, and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its depth, height and position close to the boundary of the site would appear intrusive and would have an over domineering and unneighbourly impact upon the amenities of adjacent occupiers. In this respect the proposal would be contrary to policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the London Borough of Havering's  Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011, and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were considered to be negotiated with the agent of the applicant. However, given the design issues which would require re-consultation, negotiation was not entered into, but an attempt was made to inform the agent by telephone on 07/10/20, but he was unavailable."
