    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk and mass and proximity to the side boundary on this prominent corner plot would result in a cramped form of development, detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed new dwelling attached to the side of the existing semi-detached dwelling would form a terrace in a street entirely characterised by semi-detached properties, which would be an out of character for the built form in this locality and adversely disrupt the established pattern of development, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed new drop kerb in Spey Way due to its close proximity to the junction with Moray Way falls short of the required distance which would have an adverse impact on the safety of other road users and pedestrians contrary to Policy T4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy 23 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Amendments were sought by staff which addressed issues with parking, however it was not considered that the above reasons for refusal were capable of being overcome. Consideration was given to seeking fruther amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent by email on 06/09/22.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £3,800  at a rate of £25 per sqm (154m² x 25).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125.76 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £19,115, both subject to indexation.",
