    "The side/rear extension, by reason of its bulk, volume and footprint, results in disproportionate additions to the original house over and above its original form and therefore materially harms the character and openness of the Metropolitan Green Belt.  No very special circumstances to justify such harm have been submitted with the application. Due to the cumulative depth of extensions to the dwelling when joined to the existing extensions, the extension also forms a visually intrusive feature with the rear garden scene of the host dwelling that is to the detriment of the character and appearance of this modest bungalow and visual amenity of the locality. The extension is therefore considered to be contrary to the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D4 and G2 of the London Plan, Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent by e-mail on 14/02/2025."
