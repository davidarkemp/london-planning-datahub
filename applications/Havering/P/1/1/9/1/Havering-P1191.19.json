    "The proposed development would - through unacceptably small bedrooms and the inappropriate design and layout of the scheme - provide sub-standard units of accommodation and cramped living conditions for future occupants. The proposed development would be unacceptable when assessed against policy 3.5 (and Table 3.3) of the London Plan (MALP 2016), policy D6 (and Table 3.1) of the Draft London Plan (Intend to Publish December 2019), the Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard (March 2015), and policies CP17, DC3 and DC61 of LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the planning agent for the scheme prior to the decision notice being issued. The reasoned justification for this is as below:",
    "Paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) (the NPPF) requires Local Planning Authorities to approach decisions on proposed development in a positive and creative way, and paragraph 41 of the NPPF places an expectation that issues on applications should be addressed prior to submission of an application. The Council has made available on its website the policies and guidance provided by the Development Plan in its entirety. The Council also offers a full pre-application advice service in order to ensure that the applicant has every opportunity to submit"
