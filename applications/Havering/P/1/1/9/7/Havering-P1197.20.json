    "The outdoor seating area and awning by virtue of its location and protrusion would reduce the amount of useable, unobstructed footway, which adversely impacts on the proper function of public highway; hinder access and pedestrian movement and have detrimental impact on the promotion of walking and highway safety contrary to Policies DC32 and DC34 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The outdoor seating area and awning gives rise to an unsympathetic, visually intrusive development and adds to visual clutter which detracts from the character and appearance of the streetscene contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent Mr Kumar on 13/11/2020."
