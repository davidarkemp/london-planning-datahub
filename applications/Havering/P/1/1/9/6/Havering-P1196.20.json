  "description": "Erection of single storey 1-bed detached dwelling with associated amenity area and parking involving demolition of garages associated with 7 and 9 Aylett Road",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, scale, height, position and cumulative design failings as an independent dwelling appear as an uncharacteristically cramped on site and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of its site constraints, in particular the inadequate provision of the minimum internal space standards, shallow rear garden; proximity to the rear boundary give rise to a cramped form of development which result in a substandard level of living space that would materially harm the living conditions of future occupiers having particular regard to inadequate floorspace, amenity space and poor outlook,  which would be contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD, Policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan 2016 and the NPPF 2019.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its size, scale, height, position and proximity to neighbouring properties be an intrusive and overbearing development, particularly at no 9 Aylett Road, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2019: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to KMDS Designs via email on 27/10/2020.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) and Havering CIL (HCIL). Based upon the information submitted with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £832.25 and the Havering CIL £4,161.25, or a total liability of £4,993.5, both amounts subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
