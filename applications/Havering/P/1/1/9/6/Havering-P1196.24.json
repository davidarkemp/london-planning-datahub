    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation resulting in poor aspect and outlook from the bedroom window in close proximity of the neighbouring boundary with No.6 Hilldene Avenue, would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure, in direct contrast to the aims of Policies 7 and 9 of the Havering Local Plan and with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The poor layout and lack of private amenity space creates conditions that result in inadequate provision of external amenity space and the potential for overlooking, loss of privacy and undue noise and disturbance to occupiers of the ground floor flat, which provides a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policies 7 and 9 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Murat Altinkilic (Agent) by e-mail on 05/12/24.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
