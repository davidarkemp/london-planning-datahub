    "The proposed dwelling through its bulk, scale, mass and design, would form an isolated, incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development fails to provide adequate provision of useable and functional external private amenity space as well as appropriate levels of outlook and aspect from the main habitable living room, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupants, contrary to the provisions of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed dwelling would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature from adjacent rear gardens of nos. 5 & 6 Tweed Glen, detrimental to neighbouring amenity and would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. There would also be conflict with paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate parking arrangements for a vehicle to manoeuvre within the site to be able to exit the site in forward gear, as well as to provide sufficient visibility splays from the drive way onto Tweed Way, resulting in an unsatisfactory arrangement which would be detrimental to safety of pedestrians and other road users, contrary to Policies T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 24 of the Local Plan.",
