    "The proposed development would by reason of its unsympathetic design and massing be of detriment to the intrinsic character of the host premises and combined with the existing extensions to the property, would be harmful to the open and spacious character of the streetscene and would consequently neither preserve nor enhance the special character of this part of the Conservation Area. The development sought is therefore contrary  to Policies CP18, DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
