    "The proposed loft conversion including the hip to gable roof conversion to the main dwelling and  the rear dormer window would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary",
    "The proposed Loft conversion including rear dormer windows, by reason of its location and close nature to the boundaries to the rear propserties gardens, would result in an unsatisfactory relationship between the host property and neighbours at the rear, leading to overlooking and loss of privacy to the detriment of their amenity and contrary to Policy 26 of the local plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the London Plan 2021."
