    "The proposed layout of the development would result in some bedrooms failing to meet the minimum width, resulting in substandard residential accommodation detrimental to the amenity of the future residents contrary to Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development, including the front gardens of the proposed dwellings, would provide an extremely tight layout and the proposal would appear unduly cramped harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policies 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Due to the narrow route and location of the access lane leading to the rear site entrance, the proposals would not be served by adequate and safe access to meet the needs of future occupiers and in the absence of visibility splay drawings and information regarding the provision of sightlines, it has not been demonstrated that vehicles could be manoeuvred on site and safely access and exit the site to ensure that there is no impacts on pedestrian and highway safety contrary to Policies 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies T4 and D11 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed built form and associated hardstanding of the proposed development would fail to maximise opportunities for greening and enhance biodiversity and would result in significant adverse impacts on green infrastructure and biodiversity which has not been effectively mitigated against contrary to Policies 10 and 27 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies G6 and G7 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Design Graphics Associates via email on 13th December 2024.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £23,016 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £7,192.50 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £55/sq.m (Zone B) and the floorspace of 287.7 square metres.",
