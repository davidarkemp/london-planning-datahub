    "The single storey structure hereby approved shall only be used for storage purposes in associated with the existing occupiers of the dwellings on the site and shall not be used for any other purposes, in particular it shall not be used as a habitable space or residential accommodation  or be used by any person who does not reside on site.",
    "Reason:",
    "The outbuilding is located within the communal amenity space as well as car parking spaces shared by 5 flats in the main house and an existing outbuilding.  To use the outbuilding for any other purposes would have an adverse impact upon the amenities of the existing occupiers as well as the limited available car parking spaces on site. The building is also situated within Flood Zone 3b and is judged to be unsuitable for principal residential occupation.",
    "You are informed that the structure is within a Flood Risk Zone 3b which has the highest probability of flooding and therefore there is potential to risk of health and damage to property. It would be therefore prudent to avoid storing items of significant value in the structure."
