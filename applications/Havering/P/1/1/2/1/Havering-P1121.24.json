    "The proposed dwelling due to its design and appearance would relate poorly to the character of the existing dwelling and would disrupt the symmetry of the existing pair of houses, thereby resulting in material harm to the character of the existing property and would thereby be incongruous and visually intrusive in the street-scene therefore harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2016), Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan. There would also be conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character, the design principles and which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area and maintain a strong sense of place.",

    "The layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through insufficient floor to ceiling height of the dwelling and the development would therefore give rise to a poor quality residential environment, harmful to the amenities of the occupiers. As a result, the development would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development through its scale, bulk and mass and proximity to the boundary, in particular the projection beyond the rear building line of the donor property No.24 Princes Park, Rainham would would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature harmful to outlook of occupiers with a loss light detrimental to the amenity of occupiers of this dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
