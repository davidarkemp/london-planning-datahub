    "The canopy and awning in combination wtih the proposed seating area would lack subservience to the host building and would form a prominent feature in the street-scene, detrimental to the character of the subject building and parade whilst also setting a harmful precedent through the degree of permanence. It is considered that the arrangement set out on submitted plans when deployed would appear excessive and overbearing in scale, thus detrimental to the aesthetic of the host premises, wider parade and consequently the wider street scene, contrary to Policies 13 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 as well as Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which requires development add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character. The proposals would also set a harmful precedent for other similar development.",
