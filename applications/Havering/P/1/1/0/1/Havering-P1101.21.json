  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The premises (58 Station Road) shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 09:00 and 21:00 Mondays to Fridays, 09:00 and 17:00 on Saturdays and 10:00 and 16:00 on Sundays and Bank/Public Holidays, without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control in the interests of amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Existing active window display shall be maintained at all times in the shop window fronting Station Road.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of visual amenity, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to the use hereby permitted coming into use details of a waste management scheme must be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall include details of the method and location of refuse and recycling storage, including provision for all refuse to be properly contained within the approved facility, together with arrangements for refuse disposal. The scheme shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how waste will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail within 2 months of the date of this decision will protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises, and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "Please note that the hours of operation hereby apply only to 58 Station Road, with the unit to the rear 1A Howard Road required to operate in line with the conditions imposed upon the earlier approval under ref: P0448.20."
