    "The proposed extension, in particular the first floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk and mass would unacceptably compromise the symmetrical architectural composition of the building and unbalance the appearance of this semi-detached property and appear as an unacceptably dominant feature in the rear garden environment, harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extension and Alteration Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and width, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers; contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
