  "decision_process": "Delegated",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Except in compliance with Condition 13, the development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials set out in the Design and Access Statement dated 08-07-2022 unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development has a suitably high quality finish consistent with the design concept.",
    "Prior to any above ground works a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To prevent noise nuisance to nearby properties.",
    "Prior to their installation details of any renewable energy systems shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. This shall extend to details of the proposed PV panels and methodology for installation of the GSHP referred to in writing to the LPA dated 20 Sept 2022. Measures as agreed shall then be installed and retained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: In the interests of sustainability.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason: To protect residential amenity.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason: In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "No operations shall commence on site in connection with the development hereby approved (including demolition works, tree works, fires, soil moving, temporary access construction and / or widening or any operations involving",
    "the use of motorised vehicles or construction machinery) until a detailed Arboricultural Method Statement (AMS) in accordance with BS5837:2012 Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction - Recommendations has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and the protective fencing is erected as required by the AMS.",
    "Reason: To ensure suitable landscape quality and retention of trees which make a positive contribution to local landscape character/quality.",
    "Prior to first use/occupation of the building hereby permitted the applicant shall submit for the approval of the Local Planning Authority a Travel Plan to include measures to encourage staff and visitors to travel to the site by means other than by private car. The plan as approved shall be monitored and reviewed on an annual basis for three years and a copy of that review and action plan arising shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents/staff, in the interests of sustainability",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on drawing no. A1234-A-R1-01-P prior to any above ground works a full scheme of hard and soft landscaping shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. This shall extend to the pot size (in litres, girth of trees) and planting density throughout in particular at the boundaries of the site. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development achieves a satisfactory level of landscape quality.",
    "Prior to any above ground works details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until external lighting is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The lighting shall be provided and operated in strict accordance with the approved scheme.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the impact arising from any external lighting required in connection with the building or use.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect residential amenity.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on the plans accompanying the application hereby approved, no part of the development shall commence until full details of level or ramped access for the building is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The applicant should note that the current ramp shown does not comply with accessibility requirements and an alternate ramp may not be considered acceptable as part of any details required by this condition, therefore the Local Planning Authority reserves the right to refuse to approve details on grounds including poor design, impact on the functioning of the site/building itself and the wider site.",
    "Reason:- In the interests of accessibility and to ensure satisfactory design.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing and by telephone. The revisions involved additional planting to the shared boundary and reduced height of the north facing elevation. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 13-09-2022, a daylight sunlight study was then provided 26-10-2022.",
    "Whilst the assessment undertaken as part of this submission finds the area of the site to which the permission relates to be of low ecological value, this does not discharge the applicant from responsibilities under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 the contravention of which is a criminal offence. The applicant is advised to consider the methodology set out in the Ecological Appraisal submitted with this application.",
    "Precautionary advice for birds",
    "Birds are legally protected during the breeding season and need to be considered in respect of any impact from the proposed work. Work involving vegetation clearance must take place outside the optimum breeding season (March to August inclusive), unless it can be confirmed there are no breeding birds in the proposed work area. Note that birds frequently nest outside of the optimum period, particularly during spells of milder weather. It should never be assumed work can always take place without prior investigation.",
    "Birds generally tend to nest in dense shrub beds and mature trees. Where such vegetation may be affected by the proposed work it will require inspection for nesting birds. For example, but not exclusively, blackbird, dunnock, robin, blue and great tit, pigeons, magpies and crows.",
    "When reinstating vegetation and hardstand following building, install permeable surfaces, water butts and rain gardens. Plant a diverse mix of trees, shrubs and her"
