    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "The extension hereby permitted shall be used only for living accommodation as an integral part of the existing dwelling known as 105A Cranston Park Avenue, Upminster and shall not be used as a separate unit of residential accommodation at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The site is within an area where the Local Planning Authority consider that the sub-division of existing properties should not be permitted in the interests of amenity.",
    "Land Ownership Informative",
    "The applicant is advised that this planning permission does not give consent for any part of the development or any remedial works including guttering and fascias to encroach onto any land not within the applicant's ownership.",
    "Decking or Raised Platform Informative",
    "Putting up decking, or other raised platforms, in your garden is permitted development, not needing an application for planning permission, providing:",

    "·Together with other extensions, outbuildings etc, the decking or platforms cover no more than 50 per cent of the garden area.",
    "·None of the decking or platform is on land forward of a wall forming the principal elevation.",
    "Party Wall Informative",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
    "A free guide called \"The Party Wall Etc Act 1996: Explanatory Booklet\" is available on the website of the Department for Communities and Local Government.",
    "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-party-wall-etc-act-1996-revised-explanatory-booklet",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
