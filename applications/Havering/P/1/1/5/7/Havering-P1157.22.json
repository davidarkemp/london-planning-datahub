    "The proposed annexe by reason of its excessive height, bulk, mass and siting would be against the pattern of the development of the local area. It would appear out of scale and character and would be materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Local Plan and the residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed annexe, which could function as a self-contained residential unit in the rear garden scene, would result in additional comings and goings, noise and disturbance to the detrimental impact of neighbours' amenity contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Nathalie (agent) by email on 07/09/22."
