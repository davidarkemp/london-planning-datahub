  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature harmful to the character of the surrounding area and streetscene of this part of Emerson Park, contrary to Policies DC61 and DC69 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position, bulk, massing and proximity to neighbouring properties, form a visually intrusive and over dominant feature resulting in a detrimental impact on outlook and a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers by way of overlooking and invasion of privacy, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The tree and shrub clearance necessary to enable the proposed development would detract from the character of the site and would have an adverse impact on the visual amenity and quality of the area by reason of loss of trees, contrary to the provisions of Policy DC60 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Protection of Trees During Development SPD.",
    "In the absence of a mechanism to secure a planning obligation towards the infrastructure costs of new development the proposal is contrary to the provisions of the Havering Planning Obligations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC72 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 31 (cc) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2010: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal, rather than negotiation, was in this case appropriate in accordance with para 186-187 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012.",
    "During consideration by the committee, members placed different weight on the planning merits and decided to refuse planning permission."
