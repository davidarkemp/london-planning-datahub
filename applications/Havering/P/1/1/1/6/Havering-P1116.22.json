    "The proposed development would, by reason of its siting, depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, would be an overbearing and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the visual amenities of adjacent occupiers at No6 contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant addition to the host property resulting in a visually intrusive feature to the adverse impact on the appearance and character of the host property and the semi-detached pair and in the street scene contrary to 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Humphreys (agent) by email on 25/08/22.",
