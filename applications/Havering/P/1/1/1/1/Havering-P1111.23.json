    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its overall depth, height, bulk and proximity to the boundary with no.30 Brookside result in a dominant and visually intrusive development, giving rise to an overbearing impact on the amenity of this property.  Additionally, the overall depth of the extension combined with the proposed roof terrace and its proximity to both neighbouring boundaries would give rise to increased overlooking and loss of privacy from the roof terrace to the detriment of the amenity of the adjoining occupiers at No.26 and No.30 Brookside contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021 and Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
