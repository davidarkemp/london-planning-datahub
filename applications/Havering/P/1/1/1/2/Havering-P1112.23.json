    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its flat roof design be incongruous and out of character with the site and surrounding area. In addition, the proposed ground floor deck area, with no boundary fence on the eastern elevation, would result in significant impact on the amenity of the unattached neighbours in terms of loss of privacy, which would be detrimental to the living condition of nearby occupiers, and be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021 and Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy and in light of the previously sought amendments under the approved application planning ref: P2314.21, it was necessary to issue decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
