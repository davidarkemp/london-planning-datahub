    "The proposed loft conversion involving the hip to gable roof extension and rear dormer would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached bungalows and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive depth and proximity to the boundary, would have an adverse effect on the amenity of the attached neighbour (No. 159 Warren Drive) contrary to the Supplementary Design Guidance (Residential Extensions and Alterations) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
