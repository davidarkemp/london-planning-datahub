    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Before the dwelling hereby permitted is first occupied, the car parking provision as shown on drawing No.'s 2023/07/50HR SHEET 05 of 08, 2023/07/50HR SHEET 06 of 08 and 2023/07/50HR SHEET 08 of 08 shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the dwellings hereby approved, a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping proposed.  Submission of a scheme prior to the firs",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved, details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "No part of the development hereby approved shall be occupied until vehicular access improvements to the highway have been completed in accordance with the details that are to be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure construction of a satisfactory access and in the interests of highway safety, good design, traffic movement and amenity in accordance with Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the proposed dwellings hereby permitted, all parking spaces shall include the provision of suitable infrastructure to allow the future installation of charging facilities for electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles.",
    "Reason:  Passive provision prior to first occupation of the proposed dwellings hereby permitted will ensure that the development adequately incorporates measures to allow the use of electric vehicles by future occupiers in accordance with Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be provided with air source heat pumps, which shall be designed to comply with  \"MCS Planning Standards for Permitted Development Installations of Wind Turbines and Air Source Heat Pumps on Domestic Premises\".  The air source heat pumps shall be provided on site prior to first occupation of the dwellings.",
    "Reason: In the interests of sustainability and amenity.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
