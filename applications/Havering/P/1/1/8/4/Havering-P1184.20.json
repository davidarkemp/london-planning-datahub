    "The proposed removal of the characteristic mock-tudor style detailing to the front would adversely impact the character of the host dwelling, the street scene and unbalance the symmetry of the semi-detached pair, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011)and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD (adopted 2008).",
