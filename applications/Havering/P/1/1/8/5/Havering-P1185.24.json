    "The proposed extensions and creation of an additional 4 bedroom flat is considered to give rise to a cramped overdevelopment of the site, which fails to demonstrate adequate internal head height at second floor level or adequate outlook at ground floor level or provision of adequate, good quality private external amenity space suitable to meet the needs of future occupiers of this family sized accommodation. As such, the proposal would be substandard and result in a poor quality living environment,  contrary to the aims of the NPPF, Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that, as a result of the proposed extensions, the site will provide adequate car parking provision for the enlarged ground floor commercial premises and the additional residential accommodation  and therefore it is considered likely that the proposal would result in an overspill of vehicles onto surrounding streets, contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Baradiya by e-mail on 13/06/25.",
    "NOTE: Should planning permission be granted on appeal or by subsequent application, the applicant should be aware that the lawful use of the flat is a C3 Dwelling and the premises should remain as a self contained flat. London Borough of Havering have an Article 4 Direction in place that means that use of the premises as an C4 HMO would require planning permission."
