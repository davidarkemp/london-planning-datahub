    "The proposed additional first floor would, by reason of its bulk, scale, mass and design, unacceptably harm the character of both the subject building itself and the street scene more generally. It therefore conflicts with the objectives of policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and policy D3 of the London Plan 2021. It furthermore conflicts with the National Planning Policy Framework to secure high quality design that maintains or enhances the character and appearance of the local area.",
    "In the absence of a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the daylight received to the rooflights to the adjacent dwelling to the east of no.49 St Marys Lane and impact on its outlook due to the close proximity to the boundary, conflicting with policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive overall bulk, mass and extensive pitched roof form, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development, which would be most oppressive and give rise to an undue sense of enclosure to the detriment of residential amenity especially those occupiers of no.49 St Marys Lane, contrary to policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Colin Harper-Penman, by email on 08.10.2024.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £942.25 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £4711.25 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
