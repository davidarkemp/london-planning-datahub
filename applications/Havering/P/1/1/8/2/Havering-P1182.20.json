    "The proposed loft conversion including the hip to gable roof conversion and rear dormer window due to its scale, bulk and mass would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden environment harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed loft conversion including the hip to gable roof and rear dormer window would, by reason of its height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.211 Ardleigh Green Road, Hornchurch contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Ms Patel (Agent) by phone on 15/10/20."
