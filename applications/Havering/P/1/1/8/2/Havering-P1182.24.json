    "The proposed dwellings would by reason of their close relationship and in particular the limited separation of Plot 2 to the boundary and flank elevation of Plot 1, result in substandard aspect and outlook from habitable rooms at plot 2 and a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants. The proposed layout of the plots and position of habitable room windows in close proximity to the shared boundary would result in direct overlooking of the rear garden of plot 1 to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers, contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7, 26 and 34 and Paragraph 135(f) of the NPPF which requires a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The proposed dwellings by way of their scale, bulk and mass, position on the site and resultant plot sizes would give rise to a cramped appearance which would not reflect prevailing character and would instead diminish the spatial qualities of the surrounding area including plot layout and size to the detriment of  Sector 6 of the EPPA and would consequently conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 10 and 26, whilst also failing to align with the requirements of the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 05-11-2024",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £13,315 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £66,575  based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
