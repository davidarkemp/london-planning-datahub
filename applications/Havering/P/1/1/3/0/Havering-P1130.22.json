    "The proposed one bedroom self-contained flat would, by reason of its siting and layout, provide a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The two balconies would, by reason of their insufficient depth, provide poor quality amenity space provision for the proposed flat harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed two storey rear extensions would, by reason of their excessive depth, roof form, height, scale, bulk, mass, siting and position close to the boundaries of the site, be unneighbourly, appear dominant, visually intrusive and overbearing the rear garden environment and result in a significant loss of amenity to adjacent occupiers, particularly No.'s 161A and 165A St Marys Lane contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Spaces Architecture via email on 26th September 2022.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £10,551 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £1,758.50 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A).",
