    "The proposed (side/rear) extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, would be unacceptably as well as being an intrusive and unneighbourly development, which would have an adverse effect on the visual amenities and character of the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent of the applicant.  The revisions involved reduction in the bulk of the side extension as well as the reduction in the size of the dormer. The applicant amended the scheme on two occasions however, they did not take full account of the requested revision."
