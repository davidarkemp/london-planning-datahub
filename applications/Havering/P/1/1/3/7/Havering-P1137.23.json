    "The dwelling would form an incongruous feature in the street-scene and would be conspicuous through its narrower form which fails to take into account the character of the street scene generally by creating a terraced row, unbalancing the pair of bungalows, and the close proximity of the development to the boundary would present as visually cramped within the site and prominent in the street scene.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
