    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with Section 92 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",

    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "Before any work above damp proof course for the development hereby permitted is commenced, written specification of external walls and roof materials to be used in the construction of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of a written specification prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The boundary treatment shall be carried out in accordance to the drawing 1514-310 D hereby approved prior to the first occupation of the site and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "To protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",

    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until details of surface water drainage works are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Surface water drainage shall be provided in accordance with the approved details.",

The lighting shall be provided and operated in strict accordance with the approved scheme.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity of the existing and future occupiers of the site.",

    "a)\tIf, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detaining how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b)\tFollowing completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above a  'verification report' must be submitted to demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",

    "No development shall commence on site, until a swept path diagram and analysis has been provided for all types of vehicles visiting the site in particular fire engines to ensure the vehicles would be able to enter and manoeuvre within the site. The proposals should also provide a 2.1 by 2.1 metre pedestrian visibility splay on either side of the proposed access, set back to the boundary of the public footway.  There should be no obstruction or object higher than 0.6 metres within the visibility splay.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of highway safety.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained. Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the Local Planning Authority to verify boiler emissions.",
