  "description": "Conversion of 2 storey semi-detached dwelling house to 2 x 3-bed and 2 x 2-bed flats involving two storey side extension, single storey rear extension, first floor rear extension and loft conversion including a rear dormer",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the additions to the building required to facilitate its conversion to separate self contained units, through additional bulk and mass at all levels, would contribute to a building in a prominent location which would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature out of character with the prevailing pattern of development detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and surrounding area, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character.",
    "The proposed development would fail to demonstrate an acceptable living environment for future occupants, through a failing to meet minimum prescribed internal spacing standards and the lack of permeability and legibility of the development for future occupants, insufficient amenity areas, outlook and natural light, all factors which are conducive to a cramped form of development of the site which would be detrimental to the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "The proposed additions to the subject building, in particular the first floor addition and roof terrace would present as a wall of development from the adjoining property, forming a visual intrusive feature detrimental to neighbouring amenity through outlook, loss of light/overshadowing and loss of privacy through means of direct and indirect overlooking thereby contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "The development would create an uplift in occupancy and an intensification of the use of the site which would be over and above what could be regarded as acceptable having regard to the size of the site and relationship with neighbouring residential property, which would thereby be detrimental to local character and the amenity of adjoining and nearby occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed car parking layout is designed in such a manner that it has not been shown to be convenient or practical for future occupiers, or to be capable of implementation in way which would satisfactorily provide the number of vehicle spaces shown. As such and in the absence of clarity there would be a deficit in off-street parking provision which would be contrary to LDF Policy DC33. Furthermore in the absence of an agreement to ensure that occupants of the proposed residential units would be unable to apply for residents parking permits, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of policies DC32, DC33 and DC72 of the Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL2) and also the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£22,500. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
