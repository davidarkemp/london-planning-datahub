    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space. As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan. The proposal would not be able to meet Building Regulation Requirement M4(2) as a suitable ground floor bath/shower room cannot be accommodated, which would be materially harmful in providing non-adaptable accommodation that does not provide for future needs of occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D7 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass, siting on a prominent junction location, position close to the boundaries of the site and forward of the built form in Helford Way, appear incongruous, unduly cramped and as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal includes three off street car parking spaces for the donor property and two off street parking spaces for the proposed dwelling, which exceeds the maximum car parking provision of up to one space per 3+ bedroom dwelling contrary to the aim of the Mayor to reduce car use and contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Design Spec Ltd via email on 15th September 2022.",

    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £11,100 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £1,850 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 74 square metres.",
