    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",

This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
