    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt and the proposed development would not align with any of the relevant exceptions set out in Section 13 of the NPPF and would therefore comprise of inappropriate development. The proposed developments, by reason of their scale, bulk, massing and appearance, would result in disproportionate, unsympathetic and visually intrusive additions to the original house over and above the host property which would result in material harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt.  In the absence of any Very Special Circumstances which would outweigh the harm of inappropriateness and harm to openness the proposed development is unacceptable in principle and in contrast to the objectives of the NPPF 2023 including the purposes of including land within the Green Belt and Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed raised terraced area and walkway, by reason of its height, depth, siting and proximity to the shared boundary with the neighbouring property no. 14 Kiln Wood Lane, would result in direct overlooking and loss of privacy to these neighbouring occupants, and would have a significant adverse impact on the living conditions of these occupiers, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via e-mail on 25/11/2024."
