    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 9:00 and 23:00 on Mondays to Saturday and 10:00 and 22:00 on Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",

The approved equipment shall be installed on site and certification provided by a competent engineer. Thereafter, the equipment shall be properly maintained and operated within design specifications during normal working hours.",

Submission of this detail prior to commencement of the use will protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises and ensure that the development accords with Policies 7 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan.",

Thereafter, the equipment shall be properly maintained and operated during normal working hours.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application with regards to a scheme to control noise and vibration from any mechanical ventilation system.

    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
