    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing open character of the area so allocated and that the new buildings will only be permitted in certain circumstances. The cumulation of extensions to the original building including the side extension proposed would result in a disproportionate addition to the original house, over and above its original form and would also, by way of the overall bulk and amount of development, be disproportionate and therefore cause harm to the openness of the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case. The development proposal is therefore contrary to the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent by e-mail on 25/01/21."
