    "The proposed development, in particular the front/side extension, by reason of its unsympathetic design appears incongruous, harmful to the host property and the block of terrace properties contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document,  policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and close proximity to the neighbouring property at No. 26 Olive Street, result in loss of light, loss of outlook and be an intrusive and un-neighbourly development contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document,  policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
