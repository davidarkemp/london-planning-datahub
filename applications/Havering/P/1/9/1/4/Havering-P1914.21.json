    "The proposed new two storey dwelling attached to the side of the existing semi-detached dwelling would create a row of terraces, which would be an out of character for the built form in this locality and disrupt the established pattern of development, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",

Consideration was given to seeking fruther amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 01-12-2021.",
