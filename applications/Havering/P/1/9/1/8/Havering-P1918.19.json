  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "No demolition or development shall take place until a stage 1 Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) has been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in Writing. For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed WSI, and the programme and methodology of site evaluation and the nomination of competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works.",
    "If heritage assets of archaeological interest are identified by stage 1 then for those parts of the site which have archaeological interest a stage 2 WSI shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included with the stage 2 WSI, no demolition / development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed stage 2 WSI which shall include:",
    "A. The statement of significance and research objective, the programme and methodology of site investigation and recording and the nomination",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans and the accompanied documents (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "If, during the remediation works, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further works (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this contamination will be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "Reasons",
    "No investigation can completely characterise a site and areas of previously unidentified gross contamination may exist at the site. Unidentified gross contamination could potentially present an unacceptable risk to human health and controlled waters.",
    "Condition 1 - Verification Report",
    "Prior to any part of the site being brought into use a verification report demonstrating the completion of works set out in the remediation strategy and the effectiveness of the remediation shall be submitted to, and approved in writing, by the local planning authority. The report shall include results of sampling and monitoring carried out in accordance with the approved verification plan to demonstrate that the site remediation criteria have been met.",
    "Reasons",
    "To ensure that the site does not pose any further risk to human health or the water environment by demonstrating that the requirements of the approved verification plan have been met and that remediation of the site is complete. This is in line with paragraph 109 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "2 Groundwater Monitoring Plan",
    "The environmental improvement works hereby permitted may not commence until a groundwater monitoring and maintenance plan in respect of contamination, including a timetable of monitoring and submission of reports to the Local Planning Authority, has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority. Reports as specified in the approved plan, including details of any necessary contingency action arising from the monitoring, shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.",

    "Condition 3 - Unidentified contamination",
    "If, during the remediation works, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further works (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this contamination will be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "Reasons",
    "No investigation can completely characterise a site and areas of previously unidentified gross contamination may exist at the site. Unidentified gross contamination could potentially present an unacceptable risk to human health and controlled waters.",
    "Condition 4 - Decommissioning of boreholes",
    "A scheme for managing any borehole installed for the investigation of soils, groundwater or geotechnical purposes shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The scheme shall provide details of how redundant boreholes are to be decommissioned and how any boreholes that need to be retained, post-development, for monitoring purposes will be secured, protected and inspected. The scheme as approved shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the permitted development.",
    "Reasons",
    "To ensure that redundant boreholes are safe and secure, and do not cause groundwater pollution in line with paragraph 109 of the National Planning Policy Framework and The Environment Agency's approach to groundwater protection.",
    "Advice",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, the applicant has agreed with the pre-commencement condition and therefore it has been determined in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The Local Planning Authority wishes to ensure that adequate arrangements are made to allow an archaeological \"watching brief\" to take place during all new foundation and other below-ground works and excavation phases of the development.  The purpose of the watching brief is to ensure that any agreed design measures to preserve the archaeological remains in situ are correctly implemented on site and to allow investigation and recording of any archaeological evidence that might be revealed in areas not covered by preservation measures.",
    "Written Schemes of investigation will need to be prepared and implemented by a statutory qualified professionally accredited archaeological practice in accordance with Historic England's Guidelines for Archaeological Projects in Greater London. This condition is exempt from deemed discharge under schedule 6 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Informative - Waste on-site",
    "The CL:AIRE Definition of Waste: Development Industry Code of Practice (version 2) provides operators with a framework for determining whether or not excavated material arising from site during remediation and/or land development works is waste or has ceased to be waste. Under the Code of Practice:",
    "excavated materials that are recovered via a treatment operation can be reused on-site providing they are treated to a standard such that they are fit for purpose and unlikely to cause pollution",
    "Ã¿¯¿· treated materials can be transferred between sites as part of a hub and cluster project",
    "Ã¿¯¿· some naturally occurring clean material can be transferred directly between sites",
    "Developers should ensure that all contaminated materials are adequately characterised both chemically and physically, and that the permitting status of any proposed on-site operations are clear. If in doubt, the Environment Agency should be contacted for advice at an early stage to avoid any",
    "Waste to be taken off-site Contaminated soil that is (or must be) disposed of is waste. Therefore, its handling, transport, treatment and disposal are subject to waste management legislation, which includes:",
    "Ã¿¯¿· Duty of Care Regulations 1991",
    "Ã¿¯¿· Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2005",
    "Ã¿¯¿· Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016",
    "Ã¿¯¿· The Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011",
    "Developers should ensure that all contaminated materials are adequately characterised both chemically and physically in line with British Standard BS EN 14899:2005 'Characterization of Waste - Sampling of Waste Materials - Framework for the Preparation and Application of a Sampling Plan' and that the permitting status of any proposed treatment or disposal activity is clear. If in doubt, the Environment Agency should be contacted for advice at an early stage to avoid any delays.",
