  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would not meet the overall minimum floorspace standards and individual habitable rooms would be constrained providing a sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers. Contrary to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed dwellings given the constraints of the site would appear as a cramped  form of development within the street character and the rear garden environment, entirely out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of development therefore harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed dwelling is considered by its sitting and proximity to the boundaries of the site, would appear unacceptably dominant and overbearing resulting a visually intrusive feature a detrimental impact on the neighbours amenity of no52 and no54 Faircross Avenue contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Copper (agent) by email on 15/02/21."
