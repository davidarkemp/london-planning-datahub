    "The proposed part single, part two storey rear/side extension would, by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk, mass and roof form at the rear at first floor level, appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment that would be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed part single, part two storey rear/side extension would, by reason of its projection beyond the front of the neighbouring property no. 2B The Drive, appear as an unacceptably dominant and an intrusive unneighbourly development when viewed from this neighbouring property's first floor front windows and would therefore have an adverse impact on these neighbouring occupants due to its overbearing impact, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 24/03/2023.",

    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £2,550 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
