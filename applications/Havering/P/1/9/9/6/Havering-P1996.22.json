    "The proposed roof alterations would not be subservient to the roof of the property, would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable as it leads to an imbalance between the pair and creates a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its bulk, scale, mass, width and roof design, would appear as a visually intrusive feature within the rear garden scene that would be out of character for the host dwelling and within the locality, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policy 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 10/02/2023."
