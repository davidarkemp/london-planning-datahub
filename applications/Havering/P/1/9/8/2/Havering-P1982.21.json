    "The proposed dwellings on Plots C-G would, by reason of their layout, position close to the boundaries of the site and lack of spacing between, combined with their bulky gabled roof form and height of the proposed dwellings give rise to development that is out of scale and character with neighbouring development in Stoke Road, appearing unacceptably cramped and out of keeping with the prevailing pattern and character of development locally, thereby  dominant and visually intrusive in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed dwellings in Plots C, D, E and G would, by reason of their excessive depth, height, scale, bulk, mass and siting, appear a dominant, overbearing, unneighbourly and visually intrusive feature in the front and rear garden environment  and provide a \"wall of development\" which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect and sense of enclosure and result in a significant loss of amenity to neighbouring properties, particularly No.'s 6 & 7 Springfarm Close and No.'s 1 & 2 Stoke Road, including loss of light and outlook, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed dwelling in Plot D would cause overlooking and loss of privacy, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, particularly No. 13 Lake Avenue contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
