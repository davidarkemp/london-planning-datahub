    "Taking the development cumulatively, the resultant dwelling would have an overwhelming presence in the street-scene at odds with Council guidance and harmful to surrounding character. Through its resultant scale and massing arising from the uncharacteristic crown roof feature and side extension, the resultant  building would form a dominant and intrusive feature with little in common with the surrounding environment. The proposals would be harmful to local character through setting a harmful precedent. In summary the proposals are symptomatic of an overdevelopment contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 26, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and London Plan 2021 Policy D4. There would also be conflict with Para 130 of the Framework which requires development add to the overall quality of the area.",
