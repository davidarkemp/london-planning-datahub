    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",

    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",

The gas protection measures shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details.",
    "b. Upon completion of installation, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gases (methane and carbon dioxide).  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect people on or close to the site from the risks associated with migrating landfill gas, and will ensure that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Brandon (Agent) by phone and e-mail. The revisions involved showing clearly the side access between the application dwelling (No.331) and No.333 Rush Green Road, reduce the width of the first floor rear extension and for a set back to be provided from the front wall of the dwelling on the first floor side extension. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 01-11-21 & 02-12-21."
