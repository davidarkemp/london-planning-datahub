  "decision_conditions": [
    "The bulk, scale and mass of the proposed development would appear as an unneighbourly and cramped development on the site, incongruous with the surrounding built form poorly responding to surrounding character and neighbouring buildings, contrary to London Plan Policy 7.4 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its excessive bulk, mass, scale and building depth within close proximity of the boundaries result in an visually intrusive form of development that would compromise the amenity of neighbouring properties by way of harm to outlook, sense of enclosure, overshadowing, loss of privacy and overbearing impact contrary to the objectives of DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to agent via email on 1/3/21.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £8,995 and £44,975 for Havering CIL, subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
