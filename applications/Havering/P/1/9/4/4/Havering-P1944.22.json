    "The site is identified in the Local Plan as being within the Metropolitan Green Belt.  Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built-up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The bulk, scale and massing and in the absence of any very special circumstances, is considered to be inappropriate development and as such would be harmful to the openness and character of the Green Belt. The proposals, therefore, fail to comply with the NPPF, in particular, paragraph 149 and is also contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would because of its bulk, scale, and massing would result in a dominant and incongruous addition to the host property detrimental to the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies  26 of the Local Plan.",
