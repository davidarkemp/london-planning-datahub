    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as amended) and principles detailed within the submitted documents as outlined in the first page of the decision notice.",
    "Reason: The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted. Also, in order that the development accords with the Local Plan policies.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under drawings labelled 'PL015 Rev B'; 'PL024 Rev B' and '17061-PL040 Rev A' unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To protect the visual amenity.",
    "Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access as required (whether temporary or permanent) there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004. Formal notifications and approval will be needed for any highway works (including temporary works of any nature) required during the construction of the development.  Please note that unauthorised works on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer is advised that surface water from the development in both its temporary and permanent states should not be discharged onto the highway.  Failure to prevent such is an offence.",
    "Due to the presence of National Grid apparatus in proximity to the application site, the applicant is advised to contact National Grid before any works are carried out to ensure that the aforementioned apparatus is not affected by the development.",
    "In aiming to satisfy the secure by design condition of this permission, the applicant should seek the advice of the Police's Designing Out Crime advice service. This service is available free of charge and officers can be contacted on 02082173813 or at docomailbox.ne@met.police.uk.",
    "The site is closely linked to areas containing Giant Hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum), an invasive plant, the spread of which is prohibited under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. Due care should be taken to prevent its spread during operations relating to the proposals.",
    "Request is made that the applicant works with RSPB Rainham Marshes to ensure that issues of water quality and water level management, which have a bearing on the management of the SSSI, are addressed as detailed plans and drainage strategies for the site are developed.",
    "A Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water would be required for discharging groundwater into a public sewer. Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. Thames Water would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures would be proposed to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team on 02035779483 or at wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be an estimated Â£449,280 (this figure may go up or down, subject to indexation). CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development.",
    "A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
