    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Before any of the development hereby permitted is commenced, written specification of external walls and roof materials to be used in the construction of the building(s) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of a written specification prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposals should provide a 2.1 by 2.1 metre pedestrian visibility splay on either side of the proposed access, set back to the boundary of the public footway.  There should be no obstruction or object higher than 0.6 metres within the visibility splay.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of highway safety, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC32.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The roof area of the building hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling, and in order that the development accords with the  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 the garage hereby permitted shall be made permanently available for the parking of private motor vehicles and not for any other purpose including living accommodation or any trade or business.",

    "To provide satisfactory off-street parking at the site, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy 5.15 of the London Plan.",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations - Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy DC7 of the Local Development Framework and Policy 3.8 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is ?Â£25/sqm and is chargeable for each additional square metre of residential gross internal [floor] (GIA).  Based upon the information supplied with the application, Â£1482.50 would be payable due to result in a new residential property with 59.3sqm of GIA, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "The proposal is also liable for Havering Council's CIL. Havering's CIL charging rate for residential is ?Â£125sqm for each additional square metre of GIA. Based upon the information supplied with the application, Â£7,412.50 would be payable, subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the deve",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process.
