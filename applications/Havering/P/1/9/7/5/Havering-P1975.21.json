    "The proposed front dormer would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email. The revisions involved setting the proposed front dormer down from the ridge of the roof and reducing its width to 2.20m. Two smaller front dormers, each 1.50m wide, were also suggested. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions however."
