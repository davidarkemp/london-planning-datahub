    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Before any development above ground level takes place, samples of all materials to be used in the external construction of the building(s) are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials. It is expected that external materials will be brick, as specified in the application form.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans, particulars and specifications (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason: The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted. Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No development above ground level shall take place until there has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development. The submitted scheme is expected to make provision for planting to the front and side boundaries of the site of a height and type that will provide a sufficient privacy screen to the garden areas of the ground floor units within the development. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless othe",
    "No development above ground level shall take place until details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment are submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby permitted, refuse and recycling facilities shall be provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",

    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "The proposed development would create a new residential unit with 101m² new gross internal floor space. The proposal is therefore liable for Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) and would incur a charge of £2525 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
    "In addition the development would be liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) which was adopted on September 1st 2019. In this location it translates to a charge of £125 per sqm of new floor space. This equates to a charge of £12,625",
    "Each would be subject to indexation.",
