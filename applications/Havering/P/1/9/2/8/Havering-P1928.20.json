    "The proposed development would, by reason of its proximity to the large and protected oak trees (T1, T2 & T3) would severely compromise the quality, safety and usability of the external amenity space which would limit the functionality of any garden space harmful to amenity of future occupiers of the proposed dwelling and contrary to Policies DC4 and DC61 of Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Design for Living Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its siting and likely proposed works to trees as set out in Drawing Numbered 06 and in the applicant's submitted Tree Survey Report result in future pressure for the removal of the oak trees protected by TPO 8/99. The consequent reduction in the public amenity value of the trees would be unduly harmful to the verdant character of this part of Hornchurch Road such that it would adversely affect the visual amenity of the streetscene contrary to Policies DC60 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document.",
