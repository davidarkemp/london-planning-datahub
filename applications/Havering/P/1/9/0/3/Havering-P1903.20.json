  "description": "Two storey side extension with new porch at front and loft conversion with rear dormer.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal development would by reason of the overall bulk, mass, scale and design of the excessively large rear dormer,  appear dominant, incongruous and out of character in the street-scene and rear garden scene, thereby causing visual harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Due to the current Covid-19 crisis, the Officer was unable to do a site visit. Site photos were requested but the agent was unable to provide site photos. In this case, other mapping services such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Earthlight were used for images and aerial views of the property and surrounding area.",
    "It is noted that the Google Street view of the property shows a different style rear extension with a pitched lean-to style roof, whereas the existing drawings submitted show a flat roof over the rear extension. It is unclear what is existing on the site at this present moment, but it appears that there is a discrepancy in the drawings.",
    "If another application is submitted, it is encouraged to provide recent photographs of the site and that the existing drawings should match up with the existing development on the site.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Ian Cuthbert via email on 9 February 2021."
