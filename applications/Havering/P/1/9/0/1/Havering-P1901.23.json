    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed on the approved plans, the application form and the Planning Design and Access Statement (December 2023) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in any wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The windows inserted on the first floor north wall shall be obscure-glazed, and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7m above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.",
    "Reason - In the interest of privacy and to protect the amenity of the adjacent neighbours",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no extension or enlargement or change of use shall be made to the building hereby permitted, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "a)\t Prior to the commencement of any groundworks or development of the site, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out suitable gas protection measures to be employed on site including, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable gas resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015.  The gas protection measures shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details.",
    "b)\t Upon completion of installation, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gases (methane and carbon dioxide).  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect people on or close to the site from the risks associated with migrating landfill gas.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is £25/m² and is chargeable for each additional square metre of gross internal [floor] (GIA).  Based upon the information supplied with the application, a £4250 would be payable due to result in a new area of 170m² GIA, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "The proposal is not liable for Havering Council's CIL.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website. You are also advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the appropriate document templates at http://www.planningpor"
