    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size and bulk, would be visually obtrusive,  would unbalance the pair of semis, would be out of character with neighbouring properties which comprise mainly pairs of two storey semi-detached houses in single family occupation, and would not respect the scale and massing of those properties, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the neighbouring residents and the character of the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (Adopted 2011)",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties and overall bulk would cause overshadowing, loss of access to sunlight/ daylight and create a sense of enclosure and overbearing development, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers at no. 17 Millbrook Gardens, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (Adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "You are advised that there are discrepancies in the plans, including the roof ridge line shown to be longer than it is on existing elevation drawings. The proposed first floor level on elevations is shown to be setback from the boundary but the plan view and side elevation show it to be built to boundary.",
    "Please note that if a new application be submitted the plans should show a true reflection of the existing building and proposal.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Wasti (agent), via email on 18 February 2020."
