    "In the absence of evidence to the contrary the use of the site, external areas and increased comings and goings including vehicle movement to and from the site would be detrimental to surrounding neighbouring amenity and the development would accordingly be contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 6, 7, 16, 17, 26 and 34 which seek amongst other things high quality development that ensures that the amenity and quality of  life of existing residents is not adversely affected. These aims are reflected in the National Planning Policy Framework at Para 130(f).",
    "In the absence of evidence to the contrary the proposed change of use would lead to increased vehicle movement to and from the site which increase existing on-street parking pressure and congestion at peak times to the detriment of  surrounding neighbouring amenity and highway/pedestrian safety and would therefore be contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 16, 17, 23 and 24 in addiiton to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF.",
