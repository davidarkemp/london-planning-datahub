    "The site is identified in the Local Plan as being within the Metropolitan Green Belt. Government Guidance as set out in the 2023 NPPF states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built-up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The bulk, scale and massing and in the absence of any very special circumstances, is considered to be inappropriate development and as such would be harmful to the openness and character of the Green Belt. The proposals, therefore, fail to comply with the NPPF, in particular, paragraph 153 and is also contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan. It is also considered that the VSC have not been demonstrated and the proposal is inappropriate development.",
    "The proposed development would because of its bulk, scale, and massing would result in a dominant and incongruous addition to the host property detrimental to the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to the high-quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given the the proposal has not fundamentally changed from the previous refusal, it is considered appropriate to proceed to determine the application."
