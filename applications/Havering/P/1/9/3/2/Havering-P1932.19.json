  "description": "Single storey side extension for use as a Takeaway (Use Class A5), and a rear outbuilding storage.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed side extension to be used as a Takeaway A5 Use would, by reason of its location and relationship to nearby sensitive receptors, in particular residential properties above and to the rear of the premises in Birkbeck Road, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance from coming and goings of the patrons and the ventilation equipment associated with the use and potential odour from cooking smell which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DC55 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development in particular the outbuilding; would by reason of its location and scale appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment harmful to the appearance and character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent Simon Dossery by email on 06/03/2020."
