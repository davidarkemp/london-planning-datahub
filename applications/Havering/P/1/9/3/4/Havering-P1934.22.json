    "No amplified sound equipment shall be used or playing of musical instruments shall take place until the Noise Management measures outlined in Paragraph 7.1 of the Noise Impact Assessment (Report 18016-NIA-01) are fully implemented and thereafter maintained in place.",
    "Reason:  In order to protect the occupiers of nearby noise sensitive premises from unreasonable noise and in order that the development accords with Policies 7 and 16 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
