  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed roof extension would appear as an incongruous and visually intrusive feature in the street scene due to its bulk, mass, scale and design features failing to respect its context and would be entirely out of character with the established pattern of development on the street, therefore harmful to local character, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties would create sense of enclosure to the occupiers of the top floor flat of the adjoining block, would have a domineering impact upon the garden environment of the adjoining neighbours as well as causing overlooking and loss of privacy to the occupiers which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupiers of the site would be excluded from obtaining  parking permits within over subscribed Residential Parking Zones, the proposal would have an adverse impact upon the amenities of the existing residents and be detrimental to the free flow of traffic and highway safety",
    "There would be insufficient and unacceptable arrangement with respect to the cycle and refuse storage provision as there would be no separate refuse and cycle storage area for the proposed residential accommodation which could result in conflict between conflict between  the residential and commercial use from use of the same entrance.",
    "There would be unacceptable arrangement with respect to the access to the proposed residential occupiers of the site. In order to reach the proposed top floor extension, one would have to pass the existing commercial areas using the same entrance. This would result in security issues for both the existing commercial uses of the site and the future occupiers of the proposed residential dwellings, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and",

    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £9,125.00 and £45,625.00 Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
