  "description": "Part two storey part single storey rear/side extension; outbuilding to rear, demolition of existing garage; creation of in and out driveway to front.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed roof alterations, extensions and outbuilding, by reason of the scale, bulk and massing as well as its unsympathetic design, including the proposed alien glazing materials with the loss of some original features of the exhibition building, would not be subordinate to the host property and, would appear as unduly dominant, visually awkward and incongruous within the rear garden section of site, resulting in unjustified harm to the setting of the adjacent Grade II listed building at no. 41 Heath Drive, and the special character and appearance of the Gidea Park",
    "Conservation Area. The development is therefore contrary to the NPPF 2019, London Plan policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 and policies DC61, DC67 & DC68 of the Local Development Framework Development Plan Document, and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed side and rear extension cumulatively, by reason of their excessive depth, scale and position close to the boundaries of the site, appear as a continuous development of substantial massing and bulk, which would be overbearing, dominant, visually intrusive and oppressive in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed removal of hedging and the extended area of hard surfacing by reason of its overall expanse, combined with the loss of soft landscaping, would set an undesirable precedent, detrimental to the open and verdant character of  this section of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The proposal would neither preserve nor enhance the character and appearance of the host property and the wider Gidea Park Conservation Area setting, contrary to the NPPF 2019, London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.8 and policies DC61 & DC68 of the Local Development Framework Development Plan Document, and the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant's agent via email on 09/02/2021."
