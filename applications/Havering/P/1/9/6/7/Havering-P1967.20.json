  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Development Framework as Metropolitan Green Belt. Policy DC45 of the LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The development is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been submitted in this case to outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021 and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed dwelling, together with the siting and size of its residential curtilage, would result in a visually intrusive form of development, which is detrimental to the open character of the Green Belt contrary to Policy DC45 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021 and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space. As a result, the development represents an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policies DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Technical Housing Standards, the Housing Standards Minor Alterations to the London Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and the Housing SPG 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Phase 2 Planning via email on 22nd April 2021."
