  "description": "First floor rear extension with fenestration amendments to the rear elevation.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear extension would by reason of its unsympathetic design and massing be of detriment to the intrinsic character of the host premises. It would represent a substantial addition to the building fundamentally altering the original proportion of the property as a 'Class II Cottage', thereby, detracting its inherent architectural character and design value. The development sought is therefore contrary to Policies CP18, DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Heritage Supplementary Planning Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 02-03-21.",
    "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures implemented, a site visit was not undertaken by the case officer. For the purposes of assessing the proposed development a combination of photographs held by the Council, street-view, relevant aerial photography and historic records including drawings were utilised."
