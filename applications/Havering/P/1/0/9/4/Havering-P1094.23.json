    "The proposed rear/side extension would, by reason of proximity to the back edge of the footway, appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature within the street and rear garden scene that would be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area through reducing the openness of the corner plot. The roof of this proposal would also alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable because it would lead to an imbalance between the pair and create a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Improvements to the proposal to set it back 1m from the back edge of the footway were negotiated with the planning agent during the course of the application. However, the resultant design of the extension was considered at detailed assessment stage to still be unacceptable and officers and the planning agent failed to successfully negotiate further alterations to the proposal would have brought it into the realms of acceptability. It was decided to proceed to determine the application based on the scheme originally submitted, as requested by the planning agent on 12/09/2023."
