  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Section 10 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "The out building hereby approved shall only be used for activities ancillary to the main use of the house. In particular it should not be used as a habitable accommodation.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposals should provide a 2.1 by 2.1 metre pedestrian visibility splay on either side of the proposed access, set back to the boundary of the public footway.  There should be no obstruction or object higher than 0.6 metres within the visibility splay.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of highway safety, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC32.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no other window or opening shall be formed on the west and north elevations of the outbuilding hereby approved without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy of the adjoining neighbours and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a landfill gas risk assessment has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Where a risk from migrating gas is identified, appropriate works to mitigate the effects of gas shall be incorporated into the development in accordance with detailed plans submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of the development.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gas.  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect people on or close to the site from the risks associated with migrating landfill gas, and will ensure that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC54 and DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with both the applicant and the agent, early in October. The revisions involved the lowering the height of the outbuilding both at ridge and at eaves. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 8th October 2019."
