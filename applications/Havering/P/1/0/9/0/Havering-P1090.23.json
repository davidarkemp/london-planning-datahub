    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and design, together with its proximities to the boundaries of the site and resultant degree of site coverage, give rise to  development that appears visually intrusive, out of character with the prevailing pattern of development, as well as appearing as an overbearing, cramped and incongruous form of development within the wider locality, harmful to neighbouring residential amenity and contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its close proximity to its boundaries with inadequate depth of the balconies and amenity areas, be provided with unacceptably small and cramped private amenity areas, which have a poor relationship with neighbouring commercial development.  The development would create a number of single aspect units and there would be extremely poor levels of outlook from the primary habitable rooms, resulting in substandard residential accommodation, detrimental to the amenity of the future occupiers, which would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would result in a studio flat failing to meet the minimum internal floor space standards, resulting in substandard residential accommodation detrimental to the amenity of the future residents contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development makes inadequate provision for safe and convenient pedestrian access, as well as failing to demonstrate adequate provision of parking and servicing arrangements for the site.  The absence of any parking is considered likely to result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads.  The resultant development is therefore considered to be to the detriment of highway safety and the safety and amenity of future occupiers of the site, contrary to Policy T6.1 of the London Plan and Policy 10 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design and layout, establish a built form which would prejudice the potential for comprehensive redevelopment of the adjoining sites. The development would therefore give rise to a poor quality, isolated and piecemeal development which would undermine future development potential for the site and surrounding area, contrary to Polices 10 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Havering Community infrastructure Levy (HCIL) and Mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Levy of £11,550 payable are (subject to indexation). Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments/additional details, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
