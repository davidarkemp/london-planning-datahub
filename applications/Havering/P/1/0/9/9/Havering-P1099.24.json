    "By virtue of the proposed extension projecting 6 meters from the rear wall of the original dwelling, and exceeding the permitted 3-meter depth under the Supplementary Planning Document (SPD), the development would breach the 45-degree rule when assessed from neighbouring properties at No. 11 and No. 15. The excessive depth would result in an unacceptable impact on the amenity of these properties, particularly with regard to loss of light and overshadowing. The development is therefore deemed contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and is considered unacceptable.",
    "By virtue of the proposed raised terrace being approximately 0.5 meters above ground level, the development would result in direct overlooking into adjoining gardens and habitable rooms of neighbouring properties. This would lead to an unacceptable loss of privacy. The development is therefore deemed contrary to local planning policies aimed at protecting residential amenity, and is considered unacceptable.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with agent via email 25th September.  The revisions involved reducing the depth to comply with SPD guidance.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
