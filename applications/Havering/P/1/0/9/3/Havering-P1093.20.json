    "The proposed development extension would significantly harm the architectural composition of the building and unbalancing the symmetrical aspect of the pair of semi-detached houses and therefore it would unacceptably be an intrusive and unneighbourly development. The scale, bulk and mass would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached property thereby having an adverse effect on the visual amenities and character of the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive depth, scale, bulk and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to agent (Michael Breden) via email on the 14/10/20."
