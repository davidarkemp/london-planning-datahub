    "The proposed dwelling due to the roof design  and design concept in respect to the fenestration read as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive features in both the street-scene and rear garden environment therefore harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area inconsistent with surrounding local character contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2016), Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan. There would also be conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character and the design principles.",
    "The layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of insufficient floor to ceiling height for bedroom No.3, the development gives rise to a poor quality residential environment, harmful to the amenities of the occupiers. As a result, the development would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would through its scale, bulk and mass and proximity to shared boundaries - in particular the projection beyond the rear building line of the donor property No.2 Clitheroe Road, Road to the north and No.19 Kingshill Avenue to the south, present as a wall of development and would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature harmful to outlook of occupiers with a loss light and conspicuous in the rear garden environment detrimental to the amenity of occupiers of this dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
