    "The proposed cart-lodge and associated hard-standing would through siting, overall height and visual bulk, form a prominent and intrusive feature out of character with the surrounding environment that would have a signficant adverse impact to the detriment of the openness of the Green Belt. The development would fail to align fully with any of the exceptions given within the NPPF and no Very Special Circumstance case has been made which overcomes the in principle and other harm identified. The development would also be contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk and mass and lack of subservience awould appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature from the public realm and adjoining site detrimental to the character of the Cranham Conservation Area and local area more generally. It would therefore be contrary to the objectives of the NPPF, specifically Para 135 which requires development add to the overall quality of the area, Policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2008.",
