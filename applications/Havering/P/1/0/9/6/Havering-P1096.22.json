    "The proposed extensions to this previously extended property, gives rise to a form of development that by reason of its design, bulk and mass, appear as an incongurous development which would be an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and that of the locality.  The proposals would be contrary to Policy 26 of the local plan, Emerson Park Policy Area (EPPA), the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, and the London Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
