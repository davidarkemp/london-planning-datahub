    "Insufficient information has been provided to clearly indicate if there would be sufficient vehicular access to the front of the site. In any event, the proposed development would, by reason of its layout, fail to provide adequately designated off-street parking, and would through parking displacement have an unacceptable impact on parking on the road, as well as highway safety. The development would fail to integrate into the existing site and the area more generally, and is unacceptable when assessed against policy 6.13 and 6.9 of the London Plan MALP 2016, and policies DC33, DC35, DC61 and DC62 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its position and inappropriate design fail to integrate into the existing site and respect the character of the area more generally, and would be unacceptable when assessed against the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policies 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), draft London Plan policy D4 and D8, and policies CP17, DC61 and DC68 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011, and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, and that no minor changes to the scheme could overcome the inherent issues with the scheme, it was considered expedient to issue a decision within statutory timeframes as opposed to seeking amendments and perpetually extending the deadline.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable  for a Havering CIL charge of £8,750, and a Mayoral CIl charge of £1,750, subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
