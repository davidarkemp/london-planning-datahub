    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted, except in respect of the proposed location of refuse, recycle and cycle storage and landscaping details shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, the premises shall only be used as a children's care home and for no other purpose (including any other purpose in Class C2 of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) (or any provision equivalent to that Class in any Statutory Instrument revoking and/or re-enacting that Order).",
    "Reason:-",
    "Only this use is permitted, any other uses, either within the same Use Class, or permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 are not acceptable to the Local Planning Authority in this location because it might result in harm to the amenities of the nearby residents.",
    "Notwithstanding the drawings hereby approved, the building shall not be occupied or use commenced until the refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be provided prior to the occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally.",

    "Notwithstanding the drawing hereby approved, the area annotated as 2 to the front of the building, shall not be used as driveway, or for parking of cars.",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the highways safety condition and to ensure there would be no potential for traffic hazards with the pedestrian and vehicular users of this section of the road, due to the bend and poor visibility of the roadways, whilst entering or egressing from the site.",
    "The dwelling shall not be occupied until a full and detailed application for the Secured by Design award scheme is submitted to the Local Planning Authority, setting out how the principles and practices of the Secured by Design Scheme are to be incorporated. Once approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with the Metropolitan Police Designing Out Crime Officers, the development shall be carried out in accordance with the agreed details.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge whether the proposals meet Secured by Design standards.  Submission of a full and detailed application prior to commencement is in the interest of creating safer, sustainable communities and to reflect policy in the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the applicant's agent.
