    "The proposed development would by reason of its limited plot width, lack of individual design, overall bulk, massing and size within the plot as well as lack of landscape would appear out of character within the area and would represent a negative impact to the streetscene contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.",
    "The proposed development would lead to a net loss of landscaping, limits the opportunity for further landscaping and does not take the current opportunity to provide landscaping to the side, front and back of the site. No tree survey has been provided to assess the impact on protected trees. In this respect the proposal would be contrary to the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD and Policy 27 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 20th February 2023.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £22145.00 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £110725.00 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
