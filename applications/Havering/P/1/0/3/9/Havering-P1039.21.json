    "The presence of European protected species, such as bats, is a material consideration in the planning process and the potential impacts that a proposed development may have on them should be considered at all stages of the process. Occasionally European protected species, such as bats, can be found during the course of development even when the site appears unlikely to support them.  In the event that this occurs, it is advised that the developer stops work immediately and seeks the advice of the local authority ecologist and/or the relevant statutory nature conservation organisation (e.g. Natural England). Developers should note that it is a criminal offence to deliberately kill, injure or capture bats, or to deliberately disturb them or to damage or destroy their breeding sites and resting places (roosts). Further works may require a licence to proceed and failure to stop may result in prosecution.",
    "The applicant's attention is drawn to the provisions of both the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and the Countryside & Rights of Way Act 2000. Under the 2000 Act, it is an offence both to intentionally or recklessly destroy a bat roost, regardless of whether the bat is in the roost at the time of inspection. All trees should therefore be thoroughly checked for the existence of bat roosts prior to any works taking place. If in doubt, the applicant is advised to contact the Bat Conservation Trust at Quadrant House, 250 Kennington Lane, London, SE11 5RD. Their telephone number is 0845 1300 228.",

    "The applicant is advised to seek the advice of the Water Regulations Team on 01268664890 as failure to comply with the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999 is an offence which may result in a fine of up to Level 3 on the standard scale, or summary of conviction.",
