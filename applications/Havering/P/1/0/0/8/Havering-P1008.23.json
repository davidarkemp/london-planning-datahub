The proposed development by reason of the quantum of development and the extent of site coverage and relationship of development to the boundaries of the site, be likely to also result in development which fails to provide  sufficient amenity space for the future occupiers of the site. The proposals are therefore considered to be contrary to Policies 5, 7, 26 and 27 of Local Plan, policies D1, D4 and D6 of London Plan and the policy advice given in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development by reason of the quantum of development and the likely scale, height, layout and site coverage  and massing of the resultant building and its close proximity to the neighbouring residential buildings, in particular Queenside Mews, would have unacceptably overbearing impact and be likely to give rise to overlooking and loss of privacy, and potential loss of light and outlook, detrimental to the amenities of the existing occupiers of the neighbouring buildings. The proposed development would be contrary to policy 26 Urban design and 27 landscaping of the Local Plan and the policy advice given in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development by reason of the quantum of development and the likely scale, height, in particular with respect to site coverage, lacking defensible space and building on the edge of the site with significant loss of greenery would have a detrimental impact upon the character of the area, The proposed development would be contrary to policy 7 of the Local Plan and the policy advice given in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal would result in significant loss of greenery with potential loss of harm to biodiversity, thereby having  significant impact upon the ecological and biodiversity value of the site. In this respect the proposal would be contrary to policies 27 and 30 of the Local Plan, the host of policies in Chapter 8 of London Plan and the advice given in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of supporting information to explain and justify the impacts of a low car or car free development on the local highway, or any mechanism to control future demand for on street parking, such as a legal agreement to prevent future occupiers of the site from obtaining parking permits, the proposed development is considered potentially to result in an adverse impact upon parking conditions locally and in this respect the proposal would be contrary to Policy 24 of Local Plan and the advice given in NPPF.",
