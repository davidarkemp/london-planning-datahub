    "Reason:- For the Council to maintain control over any future development and in response to the scale of development as approved.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",

    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area.",
    "Any new walls fences and boundary treatment not compliant with the provisions of the The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 shall be submitted for the approval of the Local Planning Authority. The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To agree any boundary treatment that is new and not being retained in the interests of visual and neighbouring amenity.",
