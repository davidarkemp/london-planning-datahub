    "The proposed dwelling in Plot C would, by reason of its depth, scale, bulk, mass and siting, appear a dominant, overbearing, unneighbourly and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, which result in a loss of amenity to No. 2 Stoke Road, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed dwelling in Plot D would by reason of its height, scale, bulk, mass and proximity to the rear boundaries of the site be an intrusive and overbearing form of development, giving rise to overlooking and loss of privacy, which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, particularly No.'s 13 and 15 Lake Avenue, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
