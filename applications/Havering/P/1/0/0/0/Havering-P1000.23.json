    "The proposal, by reason of the excessive depth of the ground floor rear extension and its proximity to the boundary of the site, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and have an adverse effect on the amenity of adjacent occupiers at no. 76 Collier Row Road, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
