    "The proposed development would result in a cramped overdevelopment of the site with a low quality design that would fail to meet the minimum space standards regarding floor to ceiling heights, lack of private outdoor amenity space, and an oppressive design for the balcony for Flat 4 that would result in a sense of enclosure, all of which would have detrimental impacts to the amenities of future occupants, contrary to London Plan (adopted 2021) and DC61 of the Core Strategy DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposed development would appear out of character in the rear garden scene due to the excessive height and depth at the rear that would appear as an oppressive and dominant development as viewed from the rear garden and rear windows of no. 60 Billet Lane which would be harmful to the amenities enjoyed by this neighbour, contrary to Policy DC61 of Havering's Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (the Core Strategy), the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, the Design SPD, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £9,400.50 at a rate of £25 per sqm (376.02m² x 25).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £47,002.50 .",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
