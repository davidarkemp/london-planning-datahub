    "The use of the dwelling as a HMO would result in more than ten percent of the dwellings on Peony Road being in use as HMOs and would also mean that more than two adjacent properties are HMOs thereby undermining",
    "the principle of mixed communities contrary to Policy 8(ii) of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "The development by reason of its housing typology, the siting of the property and the nature of the use as a HMO with high prospective occupancy would result in significantly higher levels of comings / goings and intensive activity over and above that of a single dwelling house resulting in a detrimental impact to the amenity of adjoining residents from noise and disturbance associated. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies 8 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. For the reasons given it is not considered that this could be overcome through a restrictive condition as the size of the property would lend itself to a breach.",
    "The proposals fail to make adequate provision for the amenity of future occupants with access to the communal area/garden restricted to ground floor occupants only. This would conflict with the objectives of Policy 8(vi) of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 which requires communal space (garden) as well as kitchen/dining faciliites large enough for all the dwelling's occupants to use simultaneously and the East London HMO Guidance.",
    "The proposals fail to demonstrate adequate levels of parking. The nature of the HMO use by unrelated occupants combined with the level of occupancy is considered likely to lead to increased vehicle ownership and overspill which would contribute unacceptably to existing levels of parking stress and limited on-street spaces within the locality to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding occupiers. The absence of any compelling evidence otherwise, such as a parking stress survey, means that it has not been demonstrated that there would not be conflict with Policy 8, London Plan T6 and Para 115 of the Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 25-09-2024"
