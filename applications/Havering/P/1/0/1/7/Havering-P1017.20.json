    "The proposed development with respect to the side extension would introduce an incongruous feature, appear cramped due to plot constraint;  would unacceptably harm the symmetrical aspect of the pair of the semi-detached building and would fail to maintain the open character gap of the streetscene. As a result, it would detract from the character of the original dwelling and immediate surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan",
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers; contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
