    "The proposed loft conversion including the hip to gable roof conversion with the front and rear dormer window would unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed front and rear dormer windows, by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk and mass would appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
