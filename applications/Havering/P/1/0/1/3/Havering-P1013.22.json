    "The proposed hip to gable roof conversion would unbalance the appearance of the pair of semi-detached properties and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene.  The roof conversion together with the height, bulk and gabled roof design would give rise to visually intrusive development,  harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2021, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed dormer would, by reason of its height, position and bulk appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 23rd Sep 2022."
