The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policy D4 of the London Plan and also the guidance within the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed dwelling would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature within the rear garden environment due to the excessive depth of the proposed rear projections and their proximity to the shared boundaries which would be detrimental to neighbouring amenity and therefore be contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. There would also be conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework.",

    "The development in the form of the front boundary wall, gates and railings would by reason of its design, height and position close to the property boundary form an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature, harmful to the appearance of the street scene and detracting from the open character of the surrounding area, contrary to the Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, Policy D4 of the London Plan and also the guidance within the NPPF.",
