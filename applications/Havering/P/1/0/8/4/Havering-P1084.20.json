    "The proposed extensions, to this previously extended property, gives rise to a form of development that, by reason of the extent of the alterations to the roof, including the raising of the roof, the formation of crown roof, and insensitive alterations to the rear elevation, would result in excessive cumulative bulk, scale and mass of the  extensions allowing a degree of visibility in the wider rear garden environment would significantly harm the character of the host building and be an intrusive and unneighbourly development thereby having an adverse effect on the visual amenities and character of the area, contrary to Policies DC61 and DC69 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.",
