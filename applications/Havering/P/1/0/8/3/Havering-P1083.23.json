    "The proposed extension, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, in particular the excessive width of the first floor rear extension, would not appear suitably subservient to the scale of the existing dwelling.

As such, the extensions would be unacceptably harmful to the appearance of the both the host dwelling and the surrounding area while being detrimental to the amenity of neighbours contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
