    "The proposed rear extension by reason of its excessive depth be an incongruous and intrusive development that is out of character within the rear garden scene, as well as appearing unduly intrusive to the outlook of neighbouring properties, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan",
    "The proposed outbuilding development, by reason of its positioning close to the boundaries and its excessive scale and footprint appear as a visually dominant, intrusive and incongruous feature in the rear garden scene, harmful to the open character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
