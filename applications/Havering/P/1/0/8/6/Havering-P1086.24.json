    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent Chien Wong via email. The revisions involved reducing the overall height of the proposed extension to 3m from ground level. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions however."
