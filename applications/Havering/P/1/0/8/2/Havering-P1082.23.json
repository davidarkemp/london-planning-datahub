    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its bulk, height and mass close to the boundaries of the site, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and poorly related to the surrounding dwellings scene contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposal would provide an unsatisfactory arrangement for parking for the new dwelling, leading to an increase of on-road parking in the area detrimental to highway safety contrary to Policy 24 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1900 based on £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £9500 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
