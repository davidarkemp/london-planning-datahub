    "Insufficient information has been provided as to the precise or definitive use of the site either individually or collectively to demonstrate that the proposed development would not be materially different from the existing uses on site resulting in a manner inconsistent with the designation of the site as a Locally Industrial Location - the proposal is therefore not considered in accordance with policies 20, 26, 34 of the Local Plan and Para. 135 of the NPPF, which requires development to add to the overall quality of the area, establish or maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "The use of the site and buildings/individually or as a whole has not been demonstrated to be appropriate in character or scale to this residential location and proximity to neighbouring rear gardens. Through a combination of the levels of potential activity, ambiguous character of activity, uncertainty over level of acitivies with its associated increase from comings/goings and noise, and in the absence of a compelling case otherwise the development is contrary to the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 13 and 34 through being detrimental to the amenity of surrounding occupiers. There would also be conflict with the objectives of the NPPF, in particular Para 135 which requires development to provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users and not undermine community cohesion.",
    "The use of the site and buildings/individually or as a whole collectively by reason of the physical character of the site, its suburban location and ambiguous nature of the activities which may take place, would in the absence of evidence, otherwise lead to increased movement to and from this poorly accessible site in a manner which has not been adequately demonstrated not to be harmful to highway and pedestrian safety. The proposals would therefore not accord with policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6 of the London Plan, and to the objectives of the NPPF specifically Para 115.",
    "Based on the submitted details, the proposals would result in the reduction of the existing industrial floorspace and the employment level at this location, which would be contrary to the need for intensification of existing designated employment land required to provide sustainable and viable employment use. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies E4 and E7 of the London Plan, policies 19, 20 and 21 of the Local Plan and the Council's Employment Land Review.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to meet the minimum local labour target, the proposed low-density open storage development would result in less opportunity to upskill and support training of local employees. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 22 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
