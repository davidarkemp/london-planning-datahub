    "The proposed garage conversion would, by reason of resulting in a reduction in on-site car parking spaces, lead to an unacceptable overspill of vehicles onto the adjoining road that would be to the detriment of vehicular flow and result in an intensification of parking stress, something which would have an adverse impact on highway and pedestrian safety. As such, the proposal is contrary to Local Plan Policy 24.",
