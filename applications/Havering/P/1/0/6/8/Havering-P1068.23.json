    "The site is within the area identified in the Havering Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. Policy G2 of the London Plan and Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposal is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been provided to outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt. The cumulative effect of the built form, scale, bulk, mass and siting of the proposal would result in the loss of openness to the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan, as well as the National Planning Policy Framewo",
    "In the absence of a biodiversity (Ecological) Survey and report and a Tree Survey/Arboricultural Method Statement, the siting and scale of the proposal is likely to be harmful to ecology and the trees on the site contrary to Policies 27 and 30 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies G6 and G7 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
