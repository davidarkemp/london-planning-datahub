    "Insufficient justification has been given for removing or varying the condition. It is observed that obscure film has been applied rather than an obscurely glazed unit which does not meet with the requirements of the condition as worded and would not sufficiently protect neighbouring amenity. Owing to the relationship with 17 Crossways the current arrangement is unneighbourly whereby the window is capable of being opened and is detrimental to the amenity of the neighbouring occupants. No options for permanently fixing shut or permanently restricting the degree of opening of the window have been submitted as part of the application.  As such, varying the condition in the manner sought or allowing the existing situation to remain would be contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 as well and the objectives of the Framework specifically Para 135 which requires a high standard of amenity for existing and future users and not undermine quality of life or community cohesion.",
