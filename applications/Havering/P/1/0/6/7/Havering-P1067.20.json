    "The submitted drawings would not represent the current situation of the application site, in particular with the respect to the building which recently has been subject to roof alteration resulting in the  installation of large dormer window (without obtaining any authorisation) to the rear. Therefore, it would not be possible to accurately assess the scheme and to ensure the proposal would have an acceptable impact upon the character appearance of the building, or the area, or to consider its impact upon the amenities of the adjoining occupiers in accordance to policy D60 of the adopted Core Strategy and the development plan 2008 and the advice given in the National Planning Policy Guidance 2019.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking withdrawal of the scheme or seeking amendments to the drawings, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Younus Ali via email on the 02nd  November 2020."
