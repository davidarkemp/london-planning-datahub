    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature, resulting in a terracing effect in the streetscene and would be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan and Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed side and rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan and Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed dormer would, by reason of its height, position and bulk appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance provided by the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
