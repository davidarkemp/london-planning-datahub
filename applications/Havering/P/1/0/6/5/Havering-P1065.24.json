    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed on the drawings submitted and approved as part of this application unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",

    "In the interests of privacy.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
