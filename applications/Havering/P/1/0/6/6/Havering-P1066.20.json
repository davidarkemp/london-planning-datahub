    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design, form, siting, layout and subdividing the plot, appear unduly cramped, out of scale and character with the prevailing pattern of neighbouring development harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework, the Council's Residential Design SPD and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its form, scale and siting, close the established gap between the terraces, creating an incongruous and an unneighbourly development, visually intrusive in the streetscene and harmful to the character and appearance of site and surrounding area, and would therefore be unacceptable, contrary to Policy DC61 of the  Local Development Framework, the Council's Residential Design SPD and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its depth, scale, height and siting, combined with its position close to the boundaries of the site, give rise to a cramped appearance and appear a dominant, overbearing, unneighbourly and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of the host property and the unattached dwelling at no. 22, Fairoak Avenue in terms of loss light and outlook, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
