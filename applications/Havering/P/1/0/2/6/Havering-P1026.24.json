This would introduce an incongruous and contrived design to the roof of the dwelling inconsistent with the established form of development to roofs of neighbouring dwellings along Compton Avenue appearing as a visually intrusive feature in the street scene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
