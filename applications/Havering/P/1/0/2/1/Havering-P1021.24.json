    "The development by virtue of its use and scale including proposed occupancy and overly intense operation would be at odds with the suburban nature of its surroundings and resulting in undue harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers from noise and disturbance associated with the comings and goings of the use contrary to Policies 6, 7, 16 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies H12, S1 and S2 of the London Plan and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "It has not been robustly demonstrated that an adequate degree of carer parking facilities would be provided. The proposed off street parking arrangements for three vehicles appears to be inadequate and would result in a cramped layout with inadequate access and egress arrangements harmful to highway and pedestrian safety. As a consequence, the proposal is likely to result in increased parking congestion in surrounding streets, particularly given the very low accessibility of the site. The proposals have not demonstrated that the surrounding area is capable of accommodating increased demand for on-street parking without detriment to the amenity of surrounding occupants. Thus, the proposal is considered unacceptable and contrary to Policies 6, 16 & 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6 of the London Plan, and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
