    "The proposed development would, by reason of their accumulative scale, bulk and appearance would unbalance the pair of semi-detached property and form an incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, result in loss of light, loss of outlook, as well as having an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenities of both adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Lee Chaplin by e-mail on 28/10/20."
