    "Through the design concept progressed the proposed dwellings would disrupt the rhythm of the proposed terraced row and would fail to reflect the character of the existing property and this part of Essex Close,  with one of the dwellings reading as a conspicuously narrow dwelling with a constrained frontage. The proposals are considered to be contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7 and 26, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area and maintain a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, in particular the resultant width of the development and prominent and bulky double storey height rear projections, would be a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development when viewed from Toby Way and from the surrounding rear garden environment contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "In the absence of a swept path analysis/tracking plans, the creation, siting and proximity of the car parking spaces for the development would result in inadequate access and egress arrangements that would be harmful to highway and pedestrian safety and require the removal of a street tree contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Blacker (Agent) by e-mail on 19th September 2024.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £16,950 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £16,950 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 113 square metres.",
