  "description": "Vehicle crossing and a hard standing area in front garden to provide car parking space.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans, particulars and specifications.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "a) If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b) Following completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any works in connection with the formation of the access to the highway hereby approved, the existing street lighting column to the front of the application site shall be relocated, subject to the approval of the Highways Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The existing street lighting column would be too close to the proposed vehicle crossing and likely to be damaged in its current location.",
    "The hard surface provided in connection with the access hereby approved shall be made of porous materials and/or provision made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to minimise surface water run-off from the property into the mains drainage system and to minimise contribution to flooding.",
    "Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed.  If new or amended access as required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer (including their representatives and contractors) is advised that planning consent does not discharge the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic Management Act 2004.  Formal notifications and approval will be needed for any highway works (including temporary works of any nature) required during the construction of the development. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",
    "The developer is advised that if construction materials are proposed to be kept on the highway during construction works then they will need to apply for a license from the Council. If the developer requires scaffolding, hoarding or mobile cranes to be used on the highway, a licence is required and Street Management should be contacted make the necessary arrangements. Please note that unauthorised use of the highway for construction works is an offence.",
    "The developer is advised that surface water from the development in both its temporary and permanent states should not be discharged onto the highway. Failure to prevent such is an offence."
