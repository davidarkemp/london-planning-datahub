    "Prior to the use of the crossover for vehicle parking within the front boundary of the site all hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site. This is notwithstanding the existing hardsurface in the front garden.",
