There would be conflict also with the NPPF which at Para 130(a) which requires development add to the overall quality of the area.",
    "The proposed front side and rear extension would form a visually dominant and overbearing feature from the rear gardens and windows of surrounding properties through its unsympathetic scale, bulk and massing and proximity to shared boundaries in particular those occupiers of  nos 16 and 18 Mermagen Drive and the adjoining site where a permission has been implemented. The development would form an intrusive and overbearing feature detrimental to outlook and would in the absence of evidence otherwise likely give rise to some degree of overshadowing. The development is therefore be contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
