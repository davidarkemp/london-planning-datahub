    "The balcony installed would form an invasive and incongruous design feature and would exacerbate the visual impacts of the dormer which is observed not to be lawful through the passing of time. Visual and character impacts aside, the balcony would be unneighbourly and would cause direct overlooking and loss of privacy which would be detrimental to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers thereby contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 26 and 34, design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the National Planning Policy Framework which fundamentally at paragraph 130 requires development add to the overall quality of the area and create a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
