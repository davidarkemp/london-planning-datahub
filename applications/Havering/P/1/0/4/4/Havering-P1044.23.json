    "The proposed dwellings due to the site layout would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7,10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the guidance within the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal head height and also due to the poor quality and usability of the outdoor amenity space due to limited width. As a result, the development would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and NPPF.",
    "The proposed development would result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The constrained plot and arrangement of living accommodation resulting in poor aspect and outlook due to lack of windows to the kitchens, would be substandard and give rise to an overwhelming sense of enclosure and impact on enjoyment of the dwelling, in direct contrast to the aims of Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and NPPF.",
    "There are two car parking spaces each for each of the dwellings, which exceeds the maximum car parking provision of up to one space contrary to the aim of the Mayor to reduce car use and contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision for the donor property at No.46 New Zealand Way, Rainham would result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development through its scale, bulk and mass and proximity to shared boundaries with Nos.46 and 48 New Zealand Way would present as a wall of development and would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature harmful to outlook of occupiers and conspicuous in the rear garden environment detrimental to the amenity of occupiers of this dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking/inter-looking and a loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mrs Moskaliova by e-mail on 26-10-23.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £26,700 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £26,700 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 89 square metres.",
