    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing open character of the area so allocated and that the new buildings will only be permitted in certain circumstances. The development is, by reason of its height, scale, bulk and mass, would be materially larger than the original dwelling combined with the retention of the storage & garage which was not demolished which would cause harm to the openness of the Green Belt. No very special circumstances have been submitted in this case that would clearly outweigh the identified harm to the Green Belt. The development proposal is therefore contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
