    "The proposed maisonettes would, by reason of their siting, gabled roof form, height, scale, bulk and mass, appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the streetscene harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and appear dominant and visually intrusive in the front and rear garden environments harmful to the residential amenity of neighbouring properties, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D4 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed maisonettes would, by reason of their poor layout and insufficient floor to ceiling height, be of poor quality resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of internal space, poor outlook, limited light and disturbance from vehicle headlights beaming into habitable rooms, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal fails to provide any three or four bedroom family units, contrary to Policy 5 of the Havering Local Plan. No justification has been provided for the departure from the recommended mix of dwelling types.",
    "The first floor terraces of Flats 2 & 3 would, by reason of their siting and proximity to the boundaries of the site, cause overlooking and loss of privacy, which would be materially harmful to the amenity of neighbouring properties contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "There is one car parking space for each maisonette, which exceeds the maximum car parking provision of up to 0.75 spaces per 1-2 bedroom dwelling contrary to the aim of the Mayor to reduce car use and contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "In the absence of a swept path analysis/tracking plans and a proposed block plan that shows the area of soft landscaping at the end of this cul-de-sac and a lamp post, the creation, siting and proximity of the parking spaces for the maisonettes to the boundaries of the site would, impede pedestrian access to these properties and result in a cramped layout with inadequate access and egress arrangements harmful to highway and pedestrian safety and the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Essex Design Studio via email on 13th October 2022.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of ??£45,240 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £7,540 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of ?????????£25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of ?????????£125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 301.6 square metres.",
