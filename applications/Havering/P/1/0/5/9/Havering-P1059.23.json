    "The site is within the area identified in the Havering Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. Policy G2 of the London Plan and Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The development is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been provided to outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt. The scale, bulk and mass of the proposed development would, in addition to the dwelling approved under P1001.03, represent disproportionate additions and result in a loss of openness to the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy G2 of t",
    "In the absence of a Tree Survey/Arboricultural Method Statement, the siting and scale of the proposal is likely to be harmful to the trees on the site contrary to Policy 27 of the Havering Local Plan, G7 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
