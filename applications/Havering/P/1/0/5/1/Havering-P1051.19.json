    "The proposed development with respect to the roof alteration would appear appear incongruous, dominant, and visually intrusive when viewed from the rear gardens of the adjoining building. The proposed side extension would introduce an incongruous feature to the front by incorporating a part flat roof with parapet to the front and would fail to maintain a gap to the boundary, thereby creating a terracing effect which would be against the dominant character of the street scene, which is generally forms by semi detached properties contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",

However, the applicant did not agree with the changes. The agent was informed with respect to refusal of the scheme on 6.12.2019 and then further confirmed on 12.12.2019."
