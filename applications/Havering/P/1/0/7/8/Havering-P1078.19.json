    "The site is within the area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The LDF and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances.  No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed new building by reason of its combined scale, bulk and mass, proximity to the site boundaries and visual appearance would result in a cramped form of development on the site, out of character with the locality and to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6.",
    "The proposed development would not demonstrate a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers, with the arrangement shown symptomatic of a cramped overdevelopment of the site which would be the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The development would utilise a site arrangement within provision of external spaces which would diminish outlook and privacy and contribute to an inadequate residential setting contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed building would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties and provision of windows within the flank wall would give rise to increased potential for inter-looking and thereby a perceived loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, thereby the proposals are contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto surrounding roads to the detriment of highway safety and the comfort and convenience of existing occupiers through increased competition for limited on-street parking contrary to Policies DC61 and DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Amendments were sought by staff which addressed issues with parking, however it was not considered that the above reasons for refusal were capable of being overcome. Consideration was given to seeking fruther amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 03-09-2019.",
    "Please note also that should permission be granted, from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £39,840 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development. Based upon calculations undertaken by the case officer and information supplied with the application your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £12,450 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of"
