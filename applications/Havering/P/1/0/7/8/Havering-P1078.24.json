    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans and documents (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed lighting hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the details set out in the Strenger Lighting Assessment dated July 2024 forming part of this application and thereafter maintained as such unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and maintain residential amenity.",
    "The proposed lighting hereby approved shall be timer controlled and shall only be in use during the opening hours of Enterprise Rent-a-Car.  At all other times they shall be switched off, save for the use of motion sensors, which shall be operated strictly in accordance with the measures set out in the submitted \"Operation of Proposed Lighting v2\" document dated December 2024. The motion sensors shall be removed in the event that the 1.8m high perimeter fencing and gates around the site, as approved and erected under planning permission P0885.24, are removed or damaged.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the proposed development will not harm neighbouring amenity.",
    "The proposed lighting hereby approved shall be operated fully in accordance with the details set out in the document \"Operation of Proposed Lighting v2\" submitted with the application. Specifically, the motion sensors shall be set to only pick up activity from within the site and any individual light shall not illuminate for a period in excess of 60 seconds.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the proposed development will not harm neighbouring amenity.",
    "The lighting hereby approved shall be designed so that in the event of breakdown they shall automatically power off so to prevent the lighting from flashing or being stuck on in perpetuity.",
    "Reason: In the interests of amenity, public safety and in order to retain effective planning control.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
