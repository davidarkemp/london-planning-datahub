  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey front extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the front garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its roof form, excessive width, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Breden (agent) by phone and e-mail. The revisions involved setting the first floor rear extension in 2m from the boundary with No.71 Maybank Avenue and providing an alternative roof form. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
