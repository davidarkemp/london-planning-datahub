    "The scale of the business use based on the number of children/staff proposed and associated likely activity in comparison with the lawful use of the existing premises as a single dwelling house would adversely affect the predominantly residential character of the area and therefore would be contrary to Policies 16 and 17 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 which amongst other things requires uses as that proposed not to adversely impact on residential character and amenity.",
    "The use of the site as proposed through scale of the business operation proposed and in particular the use of external areas through noise and disturbance are not capable of being suitably mitigated and would be detrimental to the amenity of the surrounding neighbouring dwellings. Accordingly the proposed development would be contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 6, 7, 16, 17, 26 and 34 which seek amongst other things high quality development that ensures that the amenity and quality of  life of existing residents is not adversely affected. These aims are reflected in the National Planning Policy Framework at Para 130(f).",
    "On the basis of the scale of the business use through staff, users and occupancy of the property there would be increased vehicle movement to and from the site over the existing lawful use which would lead to increase demand for on-street parking and encourage users to wait in close proximity to the site potentially detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety. The proposals would likely increase parking pressure and congestion at peak times to the detriment of surrounding neighbouring amenity and the safe and free flow of traffic with potential impact upon highways safety for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. There would be conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 16, 17, 23 and 24 in addition to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF.",
