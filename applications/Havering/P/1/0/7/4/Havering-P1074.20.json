    "The roof alterations, having regard to the cumulative scale, bulk and mass of the hip to gable roof extension, raising of the ridge and significantly large rear dormer window, would fail to satisfactoilry integrate with the original design of the building, would be out of scale and character with the host dwelling, the row of terraces which the application site forms a part and the immediate surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011.",
    "The proposed front porch, by reason of its size and excessive depth, would be a visually intrusive feature, out of keeping with the terrace of properties within which it is situated and the character of the area more widely.  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Ivar Selter by e-mail on 23 September 2020."
