    "In the absence of  any evidence to the contrary the nature of the proposed use, with associated activities in comparison with the lawful use of the existing premises as a single dwelling house would adversely affect the predominantly residential character of the area and therefore, would be contrary to Policies 16 and 17 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 which amongst other things requires uses as that proposed not to adversely impact on residential character and amenity.",
    "In the absence of evidence to the contrary the proposed use of the site, external areas and increased comings and goings including vehicle movement, and the noise from activities associated with the proposed use, from the proposed scheme would be detrimental to the amenities of the surrounding neighbouring dwellings and hence the proposed development would accordingly be contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 6, 7, 16, 17, 26 and 34 which seek amongst other things high quality development that ensures that the amenity and quality of  life of existing residents is not adversely affected. These aims are reflected in the National Planning Policy Framework at Para 130(f).",
    "In the absence of evidence to the contrary the proposed change of use would lead to increased vehicle movement to and from the site over the existing lawful use. Whilst there are existing restrictions in place there would be increased demand for limited on-street parking which would increase parking pressure and congestion at peak times to the detriment of surrounding neighbouring amenity and the safe and free flow of traffic with potential impact upon highways safety for both edestrian and vehicular traffic and would therefore be contrary to Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 16, 17, 23 and 24 in addiiton to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF.",
