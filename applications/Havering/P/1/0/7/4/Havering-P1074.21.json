    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth and full width to both boundaries, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the amenity of the occupiers of no. 107 and 111 Ingrebourne Gardens contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its bulk, mass, scale and position would appear as an unacceptably overbearing dominant feature which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the rear garden environment contrary to policies D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent (Mr Shane Tyler) via email on 22 July 2021. The revisions involved reducing the depth of the rear extension.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
