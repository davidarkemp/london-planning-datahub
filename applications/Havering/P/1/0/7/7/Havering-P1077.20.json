    "The proposed development would, fail to provide adequately designed off-street parking for both the host and proposed dwelling, which would rely on land outside of the applicants control to access the proposed dwelling, and which would be likely to lead to parking displacement on the road, such that the overall parking layout / arrangement would be detrimental to the safety of pedestrian and other road users, contrary to policies 6.13 and 6.9 of the London Plan MALP 2016, and policies DC33, DC35, DC61 and DC62 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
