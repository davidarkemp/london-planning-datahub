    "The site is within the area identified in the Havering Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. Policy G2 of the London Plan and Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The proposal is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and no very special circumstances have been provided to outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt. The height, scale, bulk and mass of the proposed first floor extension would result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building and result in a visually intrusive form of development, which would be materially harmful to t",
    "The proposal would result in a retail shop and cafe of a substantial size, which is over 200 square metres and is a main town centre use. In the absence of an impact assessment, the proposal is contrary to Policy 13 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy SD7 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Expanding the cafe/shop to a significant feature would change the nature of the use and result in increased levels of activity including vehicular movements and car parking, which would change the rural character of the site contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy G2 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The whole building dedicated to a cafe/shop/creche could result in significant vehicle movements in an area which is not well served by public transport. In the absence of a transport statement, the proposal is contrary to Policy 23 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies T1 and T4 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework, particularly paragraph 109.",
