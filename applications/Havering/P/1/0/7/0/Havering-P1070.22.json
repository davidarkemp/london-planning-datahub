    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, scale, height and layout would constitute conspicuous and incongruent feature in the area and would fail to respond to distinctive local building forms and patterns of development detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and would prejudice the future development of the adjoin garage block site contrary Local Plan policies 10 and 26 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "The proposed built form and associated hardstanding of the proposed development would fail to maximise opportunities for greening and enhance biodiversity and would result in significant adverse impacts on green infrastructure and biodiversity which has not been effectively mitigated against contrary to Local Plan policies 10 and 27 and London Plan policy G6.",
    "In the absence of a tree site survey and an arboricultural method statement it has not been demonstrated that trees of significant amenity value would be retained and that retained trees on the site and on adjoining land would be satisfactorily protected from construction impacts and site works during development stage or integrated on a sustainable basis as part of the site layout. As such the proposals are contrary to Local Plan policy 27 and London Plan policy G7.",
    "Due to the location and condition of the access lane leading to the site entrance, the proposals would not be served by adequate and safe and inclusive access to meet the needs of future occupiers and in the absence of visibility splay drawings it has not been demonstrated that vehicles can safely access and exit the site to ensure that there is no impacts on pedestrian safety contrary to Local Plan Policies 7, 10, 23, 24 and 26, London Plan policies T2, T4, D5, D6 and D11 and paragraph 110(b) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The south facing windows of the dwellings would be positioned directly facing the boundary of the site and the internal rooms which they serve would have poor outlook and daylight levels within and would result in a substandard form of accommodation for future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create 3 residential units and would add a net additional 294sqm of residential floor space.",
    "Therefore the proposal would incur a charge of £7,350 and £36,750 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 06/09/2022."
