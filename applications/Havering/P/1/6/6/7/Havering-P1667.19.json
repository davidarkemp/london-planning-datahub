  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal, by reason of the cramped internal layout and lack of suitably sized communal spaces for the HMO on the upper levels would create a limited and poor quality standard of accommodation. As a result the proposal would not provide acceptable living conditions for all of the future occupants, to the detriment of residential amenity and contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 8 of the draft Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of an unacceptable shortfall in on-site parking provision, result in significant harm to local on-street parking conditions due to overspill parking and the creation of a wider access to serve the two proposed parking spaces would require the loss of a section of on-street parking bay which would impact existing residents contrary to Policy DC33 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 31 December 2019."
