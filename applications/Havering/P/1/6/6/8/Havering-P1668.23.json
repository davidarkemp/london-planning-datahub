    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its cramped nature within the plot and close proximity to the shared boundaries, would appear as a visually cramped form of development that would be at odds with the established local pattern of two storey dwellings along Walden Way. This together with its poor architectural design would result in it appearing out of character with the established design of surrounding two storey dwellings, contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 as well as Paragraph 135(d) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, bulk, mass and roof design, would appear as an overly dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26.",
