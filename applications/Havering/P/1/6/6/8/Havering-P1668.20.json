  "description": "Demolition of garage structure and rear extension and erection part one storey part two storey side and rear extensions",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension would, by reason of it's excessive depth and position on the common boundary with the attached neighbour, result in significant amenity impacts to no. 27 Maybank Avenue that are deemed unneighbourly and would introduce an uncommon additional bulk and scale of development that would be out of character and incongruous for the host dwelling, the rear garden scene and surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "There is a discrepancy in the plans in that the 3D drawings (plan no. 202) show a side elevation window on first floor level for the two storey side extension, but all other plans do not show any window in that location.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to Mr Ivar Selter, via email on 6th January 2020."
