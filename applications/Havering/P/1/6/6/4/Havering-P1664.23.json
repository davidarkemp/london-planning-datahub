    "The proposed development would, by reason of a combination of its extent of site coverage, quantum of development and layout, the loss of a family unit without acceptable re-provision, the cramped amenity areas, lack of side/rear access leading to provision of refuse and cycle storage in the front garden of the site and the lack of off street parking gives rise to an unacceptable overdevelopment of the site, harmful to the character of the surrounding area and the amenity of future occupiers of the development, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and the Local Plan Policy 26.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the loss of the existing three bedroom family unit without acceptable re-provision and the failure to justify this loss, would reduce the stock of three bedoom units within the Borough for which there is an identified need and would thereby be contrary to the provisions of Policy 5 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of quality amenity space - shallow rear garden; proximity to the rear boundary, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, with no legal undertaking to prevent future occupiers of the site from applying for residential parking permits, be likely to give rise to unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be  £1,500 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £7,500 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to ZAAVIA DESIGN Ltd via email on 3rd January 2024."
