    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",

This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
