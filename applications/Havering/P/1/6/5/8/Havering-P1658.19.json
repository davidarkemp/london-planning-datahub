    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The proposed windows located at first floor level on both the western and eastern side shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass and shall thereafter be maintained.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",

Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",

    "The outbuilding to be used as a pool house and gym only. It must only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 11 Herbert Road, and not for any trade or business nor as separate living accommodation. Should business or living accommodation use be intended, an application for full planning permission must be applied for and permission granted before such use could occur. The use of outbuildings as living accommodation is not typically deemed acceptable therefore it is important the outbuilding is only used for the purposes as listed above."
