    "The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk, design, appearance and siting, fail to integrate acceptably with the host dwelling and would appear as an anomaly within the wider street scene. This development would be visually intrusive, and out of scale and character with the established building line and pattern of development in the surrounding environment. It is therefore harmful to the appearance of the site and surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, massing, appearance and siting on its plot boundaries result in a cramped form of development which would adversely impact on visual amenity in the street scene contrary to Policies DC3 and DC61 of the London Borough of Havering Core Strategy and  Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, and criteria contained in the Adopted London Borough of Havering  SPD on Residential Design 2010 .",
    "In the absence of detailed contextual plans/elevations and a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed development would due to the constraints of the site in conjunction with the siting, the proposed layout, scale, mass, height and design, would be an unneighbourly, overbearing and an oppressive development which would adversely impact on the residential amenity of the occupiers of nos 85 and 89, including loss of light, outlook, noise and privacy contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "In the absence of a full Tree Survey, the proposed development would result in the removal and/or harm to trees on/adjacent site, which would be materially harmful to the character and amenity of site and surrounding area, contrary to Policies DC60 and DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Protection of Trees during Development Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposals would have poor aspect, with the units looking over an access road and car park in close proximity resulting in substandard level of accommodation, which would impact on the living condition of future occupiers, therefore contrary to policies DC61 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (2008), Draft Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Council and the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£20,850. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
