    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, other than porches erected in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",

    "In the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage as shown on drawing no SE/39CL/02 is provided. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided as shown on drawing no. SE/39CL/02. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The use of the building shall be as a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) as defined in the Housing Act (2004), and by Use Class C4 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended), and shall not be occupied by more than five persons at any time. There shall be no provision made at any time throughout the lifetime of the development for cooking facilities to be installed in any of the bedrooms.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The outbuilding to the rear must remain ancillary to the main dwelling/HMO and not to be used as living accommodation at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The maximum occupancy of each room shall not exceed 1 person at any time.",
    "Reason:- In order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to first occupation of the HMO hereby permitted, a full and detailed application for the Secured by Design award scheme shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority and the MEtropolitan Police NE Designing out Crime office, demonstrating how the Secured by Design certificate will be achieved for this scheme.",
    "Once approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in consultation with the Metropolitan Police Designing out Crime Officers, the development shall be carried out in accordance with the agreed details.",
    "Reason: - In the interests of creating safer, substainable communities.",
    "The alterations to the building shall be so constructed so as to provide sound insulationj of 43 DnT,w+Ctr dB (minimum values) against airborne noise and 62L'nT,w dB (maximum values) against impact noise to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: - To prevent noise nuisance between adjoining bedrooms",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
