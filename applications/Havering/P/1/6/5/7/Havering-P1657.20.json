  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the substandard provision of accommodation with particular reference to the cramped internal layout with insufficient internal floorspace, inadequate light to and poor outlook from habitable room windows would create an unacceptable living environment which would be detrimental to the amenity of the future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Adopted London Borough of Havering SPD on Residential Design 2010. The proposal would be contrary to the implementation of the DCLG Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard March 2015.",
    "Please be advised that the proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, will attract a liability payment of £16,200 subject to indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "The proposed development would create 108m² of internal floor area. The proposal is liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £2,700.00 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
    "Havering's charging rate for residential development is of £125/sq.m (Zone A). The proposal is liable for a contribution of £13,500 subject to indexation.",

    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
