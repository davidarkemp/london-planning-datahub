    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the approved proposed outbuilding ground floor plan, the roof form and design of the proposed development hereby approved shall not deviate from that of the approved 'proposed outbuilding roof plan\" in drawing number P.2.1. Revision C.",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt as to the approved roof form.",
    "The outbuilding hereby approved shall not be used as a music room, as originally applied for, but for a summerhouse with a home office, home gym and general ancillary use.  The outbuilding shall be used only for purposes ancillary to the main dwelling at 6 Cross Road, Romford.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) and the rear elevation of the outbuilding building hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email. The revisions involved a reduction of the height and bulk of the roof and the removal of the music studio use. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 22/01/2025 and 14.2.25."
