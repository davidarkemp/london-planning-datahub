    "The proposed development through the arrangement of built form, massing, relationship to shared boundaries and design concept/layout would present as visually cramped and would not respect the existing grain of the area. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 135 of the NPPF which amongst other considerations requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development does not demonstrate that consideration to all the land that has potential for development including land outside the ownership/control of the applicant.  Applications which are for piecemeal development or do not satisfactorily demonstrate how a comprehensive development can be achieved will not be acceptable. Were land to the rear of 3/3A the Crescent to come forward in the future it is unclear how access/parking would be achieved, nor would it address the close relationship of the dwellings forming part of the current proposals to the boundaries of the site. Accordingly there would be conflict with the objectives of Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 specifically 10 and 26.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 5th February 2025.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £5375 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £26,875 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
