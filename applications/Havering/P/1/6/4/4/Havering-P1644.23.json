    "The usage of the premises as a motorbike sales and hire use business, by reason of its location and proximity to a pedestrian crossing and other restrictions including zig-zag road markings, results in inadequate delivery/servicing, access and egress arrangements, an overspill of bikes parking on the public highway or blocking the existing footway and traffic and congestion, all of which are harmful to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",
