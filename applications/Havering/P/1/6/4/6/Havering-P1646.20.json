  "description": "Proposed single storey ground floor front & rear extension including first floor rear extension and conversion of integral garage to a habitable space",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed front extension would be an intrusive and incongruous development thereby harming the visual amenity and character of the host property and surrounding area contrary to policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011",
    "The proposed rear extensions; in particular the width of the first floor rear extension combined with the scale of the previous extensions would significantly harm the architectural composition of the building by over-dominating the host building and further unbalancing the symmetrical aspect of the pair of semi-detached houses in a prominent position and therefore it would unacceptably be an intrusive and unneighbourly development thereby having an adverse effect on the visual amenities and character of the area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Syed Waseem (agent) by email on 24/12/2020",
    "It would appear that there are some discrepancies in the existing and proposed front elevation drawings with regards to the front extension. This should be amended if a revised application is to be submitted."
