  "decision_conditions": [
    "The unauthorised loft conversion including the hip to gable roof extension and rear dormer unbalances the appearance of this pair of semi-detached dwelling and by virtue of their excessive width, bulk, design and increased ridge above the ridge line and built to the boundary with the attached neighbour, appears incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and street scene harmful to the appearance and character of the subject dwelling and surrounding area, contrary to policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr R Alam by e-mail on 22/01/2021."
