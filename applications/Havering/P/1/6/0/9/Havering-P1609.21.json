    "The proposal by reason of its excessive depth, scale, height and proximity to the shared boundary of no. 17A Cedar Road would result in a dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and visual amenity of the locality as well as having an overbearing impact on the amenity of the adjoining property at no. 17A Cedar Road contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal would build a 2.8m high wall right up to the pavement edge and would obtruct existing sightlines such that pedestrians would not be able to see vehicles moving on and off the site and adjacent site as well as drivers being unable to see pedestrians. In this respect the proposal would be contrary to Para 111 of the NPPF, Policy T4 of the London Plan and Policy 23 of the emerging Havering Local Plan.",
