    "In the absence of a satisfactory justification, the proposals would result in the loss of an active Use Class B8 floor space on a non-designated industrial site, which would harm the long-term economic prospects of the Borough. The proposals are therefore contrary to policy 20 of the Local Plan and London Plan policy E7.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of a combination of its site coverage, quantum of development, layout, scale, height and bulk, result in a cramped and incongruous form of development, be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the surrounding area,  give rise to an unacceptable overdevelopment of the site, visually intrusive and harmful to the character and appearance of site and surrounding area and the amenity of future occupiers of the development contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), Policies 3, 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021, London Plan Housing SPG (June 2023) and London Borough of Havering Characterisation Study.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its form, scale and siting, combined with its position close to the boundaries of the site, give rise to a cramped appearance, dominant, overbearing, unneighbourly and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment harmful to the amenity of the host properties and surrounding dwellings in terms of overbearing impact, loss of outlook and privacy/overlooking, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan 2021, Policy D6 of the London Plan and the London Housing Design Guide 2023 and the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "The proposed development would, due to the constraints of the site in conjunction with the site coverage and the design approach result in habitable rooms immediately adjacent to the existing buildings to the south and eastern sides having inadequate outlook, as well as the development providing no communal amenity space, which would give rise to substandard levels of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the prospective occupiers, in direct contrast to the aims and objectives of London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design, layout and proximity to the boundaries, establish a built form which would restrict the future redevelopment of neighbouring plots and prejudice the comprehensive redevelopment of the sites. The development would therefore give rise to poor quality isolated and piecemeal development which would undermine the wider aspirations for the site and surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the lack of provision of adequate family sized homes within the development, and the failure to robustly demonstrate justification for the departure from the Council's housing mix requirements, is contrary to the requirements of Policy 5 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure restriction on ability to obtain parking permits, be likely to give rise to unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to T6.1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The Flood Risk Assessment without a satisfactory Sequential or Exemptions Test has failed to adequately address how the development would avoid flood risk to people and property in accordance with Policy 32 of the Havering Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant's agent on 30.01.2025.",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment.",
    "The proposal would have 746sq.m of new residential floor space. The proposal would incur a charge of £18,650 Mayoral CIL and £93,250 of Havering CIL based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
