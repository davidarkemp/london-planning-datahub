    "The original property had a gross internal floor area of less than 120sqm and therefore fails to meet the requirements of Local Plan Policy 8 (i) in that it cannot be regarded as appropriate for conversion to an HMO as it would have a negative impact on the supply of family housing in the borough.",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development would comply with the quality and minimum living space standards set out within the East London HMO guidance. This, together with the deep layout and narrow internal width of the ground floor rear bedroom, which would restrict the amount of practicle usable space within and light received by this room, means the proposal would represent a substandard internal arrangement that would be detrimental to the living conditions of future occupants. The proposed development would therefore conflict with the requirements of Local Plan Policy 8 (vii).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the nature of the use as an HMO with a high prospective occupancy, would result in significantly higher levels of comings / goings and intensive activity over and above that of a single dwelling house, something which would have a detrimental impact on the amenity of surrounding neighbouring residents through associated noise and disturbance. As such, the development would therefore be contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 8 (iii).",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate adequate levels of parking. The nature of the proposed HMO use by unrelated occupants combined with the level of occupancy is considered likely to lead to increased vehicle ownership and overspill which would contribute unacceptably to existing levels of parking stress and limited on-street spaces within the locality to the detriment of the amenity of surrounding occupiers. The absence of any compelling evidence otherwise, such as a parking stress survey, means that it has not been demonstrated that there would not be conflict with Local Plan Policy 8 (iv), Policy T6 of the London Plan and paragraph 115 of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing on 11/04/2025."
