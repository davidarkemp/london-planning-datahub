    "In the absence of one year of continuous active marketing evidence to clearly demonstrate that there is no market interest in the site, the proposal is contrary to Policy 20 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy E4 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "In the absence of any evidence otherwise, the proposed uses are likely to generate high levels of activity through comings and goings as well as noise and disturbance to the detriment of neighbouring amenity, particularly given the proposed days and hours of use and the evening hours of operation contrary to Policies 7, 16 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D14 and S1 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework, in particular paragraph 135 which amongst other considerations requires development provide a high standard of amenity.",
    "The proposal would provide poor access for attendees due to the location of the site combined with the significantly narrow and obstructive footpath leading to the site from the main access way; it would not incorporate adequate on-site vehicular parking and manoeuvring facilities and would therefore, be likely to result in an undesirable increase in on-street parking to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity. The proposal would lead to an intensification of the highway and would cause interference with the safety and free flow of traffic on this highway contrary to Policies 16, 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies S1, T4 and T6.4 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to LRJ Planning Ltd via email on 29th January 2025."
