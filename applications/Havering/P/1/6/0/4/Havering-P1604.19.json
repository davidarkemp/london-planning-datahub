    "The proposed front dormer window and alterations to existing dormer, by reason of their position, size and combined bulk in relation to the existing roof, would appear out of scale and character with the dwelling and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area as well as unbalancing the pair of semi detached properties. In this respect the proposal is contrary to Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
