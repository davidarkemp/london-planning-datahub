    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its flat roof design, excessive width, height, bulk, mass, prominent location represents a design solution which would unacceptably unbalance this pair of semi-detached properties and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension would, by reason of its height and position close to the boundary of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.7 Redfern Gardens, Gidea Park contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and  Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Gratrix by e-mail and phone on 16/12/19."
