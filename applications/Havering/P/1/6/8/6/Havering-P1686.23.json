    "The proposed building would, by reason of its scale, bulk and proximity to the neighbouring properties be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting in a loss of light, outlook and an increased sense of enclosure with an overbearing impact as well as loss of privacy and overlooking due to the balcony area, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The poor design and disporportionate size of the side extension as well as the excessive depth and height of the rear projections would result in a dominant and visually intrusive feature within the streetscene and rear garden environment out of character and appearance with the host property and the prevailing pattern of development, resulting in a cramped form of development contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed access arrangements via a narrow and long alleyway for both the existing and proposed flats would result in an inadequate and safe arrangement for the access and servicing of the flats.  The proximity of the main rear habitable room of the proposed flats to shared boundaries and balcony treatment would result in poor outlook for the prospective occupiers.  In addition, the lack of adequate provision for cycle and refuse storage facilities for the existing and proposed flats would result in a poor quality living environment for the existing and prospective occupiers.  As a result the proposal would create substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the existing occupiers and to that of the future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 and 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be Â£2650 based on Â£25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of Â£15,900 based on calculation of Â£125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
