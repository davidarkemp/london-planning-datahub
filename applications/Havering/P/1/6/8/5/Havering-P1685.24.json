    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their bulk, scale and mass, lack subservience to the original dwelling,and gives rise to a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development, which is detrimental to the character of the rear garden environment and wider streetscene.  Additionally, the design of the two storey side extension, including its prominence, lack of first floor set back and gabling of the main roof,relates poorly to the scale and design of the host dwelling, materially unbalances this pair of semi's and gives rise to a harmful terracing effect, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the wider streetscene and contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly form of development that would have an adverse effect on the amenity of the adjacent occupiers at No. 49 Ashvale Gardens and, in respect of the single storey rear element, adverse impact on the amenity of the adjacent occupiers at no. 53 Ashvale Gardens, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the planning agent by email dated 25 March 2025.  The agent was given the opportunity to withdraw the application but declined to do so."
