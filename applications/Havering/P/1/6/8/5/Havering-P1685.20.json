  "description": "Construction of a second floor extension to the existing detached building to create a 1no. 1 bedroom flat unit with internal alterations to the existing first floor flat.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed additional storey, including external alterations to the front elevation of the building would, by reason of its design, cumulative bulk and mass, appear as an incongruous and unacceptably dominant, overbearing, unneighbourly and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and the garden environment harmful to the character and appearance of the existing building and the surrounding area , contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and London Plan policy 7.4.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the site constraints result in living conditions that do not create a suitably high quality living environment for existing and future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would result in a substandard level of accommodation including loss of privacy with unacceptable level of amenity space, in direct contrast to the aims and objectives of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and The Residential Design SPD of the Council.",
    "The proposals would, by reason of its reconfiguration at the first floor level result in the loss of an existing family unit on site, creating an overall housing mix that would be contrary to London Plan Policy 3.8 and Policy DC2 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL (HCIL).",

    "HCIL is charged at an approved rate of be £125/m² of GIA, therefore the property is liable for a contribution of  £8,875",
    "subject to indexation.",
    "Based upon the information supplied with the application, the total CIL payable would be £10,650.00 (this figure may go up or down, subject to indexation). CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments/additional details which would have significantly delayed the application."
