    "The development hereby approved shall not be commenced until a schedule of the types and colour of the materials, including clear photographs, to be used in the external finishes of the extensions and the hardstanding to the front garden has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason:-   Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  A schedule of the types and colour of the materials to be used in the external finishes prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Works shall not be commenced until additional drawings that show details of proposed new windows, doors and sills to be used by section and elevation at scales between 1:20 and 1:1 as appropriate have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Works shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details and shall be permanently maintained as such.",
    "Reason:-Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the new windows, doors and sills to be used.  Submission of additional drawings that show details of proposed new windows, doors and sills to be used prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "All hard surfaces hereby approved as part of the development (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the application site.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding.",
    "Land Ownership Informative",
    "The applicant is advised that this planning permission does not give consent for any part of the development including guttering and fascias to encroach onto any land not within the applicant's ownership.",
    "Party Wall Informative",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
    "A free guide called \"The Party Wall Etc Act 1996: Explanatory Booklet\" is available on the website of the Department for Communities and Local Government.",
    "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-party-wall-etc-act-1996-revised-explanatory-booklet",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr S Aswat by phone. The revisions involved a revised plan being received during the course of the application for clarity that the height of the proposed ground floor rear extension would be approximately 3.4m to match the same height at the single storey rear extension at No.46 Crossways. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 26/02/25."
