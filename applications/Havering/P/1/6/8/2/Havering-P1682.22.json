  "decision_date": "06/01/2023",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents. The bedroom to Plot 1 would have a poor outlook, limited light and overlooking and loss of privacy from the parking space to Plot 2, which would result in a poor quality living environment harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan. It has not been demonstrated that Plot 2 would be able to meet Building Regulation Requirement M4(2), which would be materially harmful in providing inaccessible and non-adaptable accommodation that does not provide for future needs of occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D7 of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The amenity space for Plot 1 is of poor quality, given its limited depth and limited light, it's enclosure by the single storey rear projection of the building and a 2m high fence and would not be sufficiently private, as it would be overlooked by the rear bedroom window of Plot 2 harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan. The loss of communal amenity space for 2A and 2B Cranham Road would be harmful to the amenity of the occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "In the absence of a noise report, the proposed flats and the private and communal amenity spaces would be unduly affected by noise from the railway line contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass, siting, design, fenestration, position close to the boundaries of the site and excessive areas of undercroft space, appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the streetscene and combined with the loss of soft landscaping, be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policies 26 and 27 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D4 of the London Plan.",
    "The first floor terrace for Plot 2 would, by reason of its siting, depth, position close to the south eastern boundary of the site and proximity to Lords Court, 2 Cranham Road, result in undue overlooking and loss of privacy harmful to the amenity of the adjacent flats in Lords Court, 2 Cranham Road contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass, siting and proximity to 2B Cranham Road, be an unneighbourly development, appear overbearing and result in a significant loss of amenity to No. 2B, including loss of outlook and access to daylight and sunlight contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "In the absence of a detailed parking plan and tracking plans, the undercroft would adversely affect the site layout, function and usability of the car park for No. 266 Brentwood Road harmful to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to MJD Planning Ltd via email on 6th January 2023.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
