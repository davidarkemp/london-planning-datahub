    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of the lack of first floor set back and incongruous roof design, would give rise to a visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and give rise to a potential future terracing effect, thereby harmful to local character and contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive depth, height and proximity to the boundary of the site with the non-attached neighbour at no. 51 Chase Cross Road, would give rise to an intrusive and overbearing form of development, having an unneighbourly and materially harmful impact on the amenity of the occupier of no. 51, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of Havering Local Plan, D4 of the London Plan, and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "You are advised that the hip-to-gable roof extension and rear dormer has not been assessed in this current application. As such, you are advised to apply for a certificate of lawful development (existing) or a separate planning application for these works."
