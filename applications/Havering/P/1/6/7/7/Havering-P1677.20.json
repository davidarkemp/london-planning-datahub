  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would introduce a significant visual intrusion into the landscape which would, by virtue of its scale, position and design, result in an adverse and detrimental impact, both individually and cumulatively. It would have a significant harmful effect on the openness of the Green Belt and, it would be a significant encroachment of built development into the countryside. Very special circumstances that clearly outweigh the identified harm to the Green Belt, by reason of inappropriateness and other harm, have not been demonstrated in this case. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DC45 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document; Policy 7.16 of the London Plan; and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to via phone."
