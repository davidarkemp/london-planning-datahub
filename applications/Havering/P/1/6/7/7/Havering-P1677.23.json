    "The proposed development would, by reason of a combination of its extent of site coverage, quantum of development and layout, the cramped amenity areas, gives rise to an unacceptable overdevelopment of the site, harmful to the character of the surrounding area, contrary to the high quality design aspirations of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and the Local Plan Policy 26.), policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), London Plan Housing SPG and the Local Plan Policy 26.",
    "The proposed development would due to the constraints of the site in conjunction with the site coverage and the design approach result in units having inadequate outlook with sense of enclosure and very limited privacy in the rear garden areas, which would give rise to substandard levels of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the prospective occupiers, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy D6 and Polices 7, and 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of quality amenity space - shallow west facing rear garden; proximity to the rear boundaries, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the loss of the existing garage in addition with inadequate details on the level of car parking details at no. 177 Mawney Road, and further impact on other street furniture, be likely to give rise to unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal, having regard to the access road, is able to make adequate provision for the servicing of the site, including adequate provision for refuse collection and access arrangements for emergency and rescue vehicles, resulting in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Policy 35 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be  £2,100 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £10,500 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
