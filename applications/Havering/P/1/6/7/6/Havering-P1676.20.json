  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Pre-commencement condition - Access to Halfway Wharf",
    "(a) Access between the landside facility at the Tilda Rice site at Coldharbour Lane and the safeguarded wharf known as Halfway Wharf shall be maintained at all times from now and into the future and not blocked or the doors for the new intake canopy locked at any time. An opening providing access for freight vehicles and associated services from the jetty to the landside facility shall be created and maintained with a minimum width of 4m and minimum height of 4.2m.",
    "(b) Detailed specifications of the opening shall be submitted in writing to the Local Planning Authority prior to commencement of works.",
    "Reason:- To maintain the existing access route between the jetty and the landside facility at Halfway Wharf (a designated Safeguard Wharf) as there is potential for it to be reactivated for water-borne freight and to accord with Policy SI15: Water Transport of the London Plan and Policy DC39 Freight of Havering's Core Strategy and",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "For any development where a flood risk is identified, the Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority want to see developers consider and implement flood resilience/resistance measures into the buildings themselves. This is not to stop development but to ensure the protection for future residents is maintained and enhanced.",
    "The following measures are strongly recommended, although this list is not exhaustive:-",
    "-         Raising the level of the building by at least 300mm above local levels;",
    "-         Waterproof membrane in the ground floor;",
    "-         Waterproof plaster and waterproofing to ground floor;",
    "-         Electrics from the upstairs down and sockets high up off the ground floor;",
    "-         Non return valves on the sewerage pipes;",
    "-         Emergency escape plan for each individual property;",
    "-         Air brick covers; and",
    "-         Movable flood barriers for entrances"
