  "description": "First and second floor side and rear extensions to include x 3no velux roof windows, increase in roof height, alterations to front porch entrance, single storey rear extensions to include x 1no roof lantern.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The gaps between the houses provide a degree of spaciousness to the street scene. The proposed development with respect to the first floor and the roof alterations would fail to maintain a gap to the boundaries, thereby creating a terracing effect which would be against the dominant character of the street scene, which is generally forms by detached properties contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 and DC69 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and The Emerson Park Policy Area Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height, depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the relevant polices of the London Plan and NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via email on 17/01/2020.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would not be liable for Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, as the proposed extension would not amount to a new dwelling, in accordance to the criteria laid down in regulations 42A and 42B (inserted by the 2014 Regulations and amended by the 2019 Regulations), the scheme would not be CIL liable. The applicant has already signed the relevant CIL Form, seeking an exemption from CIL. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
