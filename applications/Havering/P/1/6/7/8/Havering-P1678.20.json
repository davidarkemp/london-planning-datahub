  "description": "Single storey rear extension and two storey side extension, involving conversion of roof space to habitable use to include two rear dormers and 3 front roof lights.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extensions, by reason of the excessive depth, bulk, height and design, would be out of character within the rear garden scene and streetscene as well as unbalancing the semi-detached pair and not appearing as a subservient extension, but rather as a bulky and dominant development, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Havering CIL. Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be a total of Â£19,372.50, subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to Mr Gary Cumberland (agent), via email on 12 January 2021."
