  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed annexe, by reason of its internal layout, independent access and non-reliance on the main dwelling facilities would be considered to be a self-contained accommodation, which would result in a development that is incongruous and out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the locality and contrary to the provisions of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed development would fail to align with the minimum space standards for accommodation giving rise to a poor quality living environment, and as such would not demonstrate a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, the Residential Design SPD and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Mr Gary Cumberland (agent) via email on 11 January 2021."
