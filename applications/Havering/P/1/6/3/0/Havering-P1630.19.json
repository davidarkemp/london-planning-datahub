  "description": "Refurbishment of existing sash windows. Replacement of ground floor toilet window and rear access door. Removal and replacement of the external rendering.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to the removal of existing window and door, drawings that show details of proposed new window and door to be used by section and elevation at scales between 1:20 and 1:1 as appropriate shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Works shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details and shall be permanently maintained as such. The new window and door shall be in painted timber, slim profile double glazed (max14mm), face puttied with white spacer bars and without trickle vents or surface mounted glazing bars. The window and door shall be permanently maintained as such.",
    "Reason: To ensure window and door details are approved prior to installation and match the existing window and door to protect the heritage qualities of the building.",
    "Prior to the removal of existing render, a sample panel of 1 square metre minimum shall be erected on site to show areas of new render and approved in writing by the local planning authority. This panel shall indicate render mix, finish and colour. Once agreed, the reference panel shall remain on site for the duration of the works and all works shall be implemented in accordance with the reference panel and shall be permanently maintained as such.",
    "Reason: To ensure the render appropriately matches the existing and attached dwelling to protect the heritage qualities of the building and conservation area.",
    "Prior to any repair to the timber of the windows, if deem necessary during the refurbishment works (i.e. cutting out rot or replacing timber elements), a method statement/ schedule of works including details of the location of repairs and replacement and the method of the work is to be submitted to and agreed in writing by the local planning authority.",
    "Reason: To protect the heritage qualities of the window and ensure there is no adverse impact to its appearance.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email. The revisions involved modification of the proposal to a window refurbishment rather than replacement.. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 2/2/21."
