  "description": "Ground floor rear and side extensions, ground and first floor front extensions, first floor addition and roof alterations, internal and external alterations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its overall bulk, massing and crown roof design, be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development and would present as a dominant and incongruous feature, detrimental to the visual amenity of the street scene and that of nearby residents, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, London plan policy 7.4 and the NPPF.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering CIL.",
    "The proposal includes the creation of an additional 131.59 square metres of additional gross internal area (GIA) of residential space. Mayoral CIL is charged at £25 per square metre resulting in £3289.75. Havering CIL is charged at £125 per square metre (for Residential development in Zone A - North), resulting in £16,448.75.",
    "Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £19,738.50, subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to Mr Ian Stephenson, via email on 13th January 2020."
