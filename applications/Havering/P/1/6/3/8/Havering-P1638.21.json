    "The proposed development would, by reason of the cramped relationship to the site boundaries and the full site coverage, give rise to substandard level of accommodation especially at the ground floor level of Plot 1 with inadequate aspect and outlook and loss of privacy to the ground floor outdoor private amenity area for the proposals. As such the proposal would create a poor quality living environment to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD, Emerging Local Plan Policy 7 and London Plan policies D3, D4 and D6 and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposed layout and design of the residential communal/private entrance doors from King Edward Road due to site constraints would fail to provide a prominent, generous and secure access for residents and would create a cramped layout and fail to compliment or improve the visual amenity and character of the area contrary to Policies D40, D61 and D63 of the Council's Development Plan Document (DPD), policies 26, 27 and 35 of the Emerging Local Plan, policies D3,D4, D5, D6, D8 and D11 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of detailed contextual elevations and a daylight and sunlight report to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed development would due to the constraints of the site in conjunction with the full site coverage, the proposed layout, scale, mass, height and design, would be an unneighbourly, overbearing and an oppressive development which would adversely impact on the residential amenity of adjacent occupiers (especially no. 62 Victoria Road), including loss of light and outlook contrary to Policy DC61 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its design and layout, establish a built form which would prejudice the comprehensive redevelopment of the adjoining sites. The development would therefore give rise to a poor quality isolated and piecemeal development which would undermine the wider aspirations for the site and surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure restriction on ability to obtain parking permits,  the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, the proposal would be contrary to the provisions of Policies 24 of the Emerging Havering Local Plan 2016 - 2031, DC33 and DC72 of the Development Control Policies DPD.",
