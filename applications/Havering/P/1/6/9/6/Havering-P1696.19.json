  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Notwithstanding the drawings hereby approved, the application only grants planning permission for the front dormer as indicated on the \"Proposed Roof Plan\" on drawing N.A/2FD/002 - Rev B, and does not grant de facto permission or indicate the lawfulness of any other development on the site.",
    "Reason: -",
    "The application was considered at a time when officers were unable to undertake a full inspection of the property (due to social distancing measures brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic). Consequently, officers were unable to confirm the accuracy of the plans in relation to other development on the site. To protect the ability of the Council to take enforcement action it is found that these are unlawful for any reason, or not built in accordance with approved plans, it is necessary and expedient to impose such a planning condition.",
    "The development hereby permitted (being only the front dormer as shaded in red on drawing N.A/2FD/002) shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved. Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with  the Development Plan, and paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019."
