  "decision_conditions": [
    "The front boundary wall, gates and railings would by reason of its design, height and position close to the property boundary form an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature, harmful to the appearance of the street scene and detracting from the open character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Plan Document 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011.",
    "The boundary treatment, by reason of its height and position would impede the visibility for vehicles exiting from the site and for pedestrians and traffic approaching from either direction and would thereby be harmful to pedestrian comfort and highway safety contrary to Policy DC34 of the Local Development Framework and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Bhuler Designs (Agent) by e-mail on 13-01-21."
