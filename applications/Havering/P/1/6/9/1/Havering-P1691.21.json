    "The proposed (side/rear) extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, result in a cramped over-development of the site and be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities including daylight and outlook of adjacent occupiers contrary to Local Plan policies 7 and 26.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and prominent location, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene, it would result in a two storey wall on the pavement edge which would appear overwhelming to pedestrians as well as eroding the spacious open character of the area detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to local plan policy 26.",
    "In the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise, the proposed development within the rear garden would result in inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity and contrary to Local Plan policy 24 and London Plan (2021) policy T6.1.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the Agent by email on the 19/11/21."
