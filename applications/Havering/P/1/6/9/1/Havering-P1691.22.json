    "The proposed dwellings would through their overall height, crowned roof design, bulk and mass and design concept in respect to the fenestration read as unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive features in both the street-scene and rear garden environment therefore harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area inconsistent with surrounding local character contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2016), Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan. There would also be conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character and the design principles.",
    "The layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents through lack of insufficient floor to ceiling height, the development gives rise to a poor quality residential environment, harmful to the amenities of the occupiers. As a result, the development would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed flank windows and door would, by reason of its elevated position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers of the neighbouring flats (Nos.138 & 140),contrary to Policies 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.132 Roseberry Gardens, Upminster contrary to Policies 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "The proposed development would through its scale, bulk and mass and proximity to shared boundaries - in particular the projection beyond the rear building line of the neighbouring flats to the south west, present as a wall of development and would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature harmful to outlook of occupiers and conspicuous in the rear garden environment detrimental to the amenity of occupiers of this dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Miss O'Brien (Agent) by e-mail on 12-01-22.",
