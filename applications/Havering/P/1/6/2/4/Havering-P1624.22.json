  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed flats would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation, due to poor level of access with noise and disturbance from the shared access, no provision of private or communal space and would in the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise receive unacceptable levels of daylight within. The proposals are contrary to Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and London Plan policy D6.",
    "In the absence of sufficient information it has not been demonstrated that the proposed dwellings would be served by an adequate and safe and inclusive access to meet the needs of future occupiers or achieve a minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of their Gross Internal Area and would therefore fail to provide a good standard of accommodation for future occupiers contrary to Local Plan Policies 7, 10 and 26, London Plan policies D5, D6 and D11 and paragraph 110(b) of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide any family sized units and the proposed dwelling mix would not comply with the Councils recommended dwelling mix. The proposals are therefore contrary to Local Plan policy 5 and London Plan policy H10.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to restrict the eligibility of future occupiers of the flats for on-street residential parking permits. The development would fail to reduce car dominance and fail to promote sustainable development contrary to Local Plan policies 23 and 24 and London Plan (2021) policies T2, T6 and T6.1.",
    "The proposals would, by reason of its reconfiguration at the second floor level result in the loss of an existing 2b3p unit on site, and reducing the unit to a substandard level of accommodation with inadequate internal floor space which would be contrary to the aims and objectives of the London Plan Policy D6 and the Nationally Described Space Standard (NDSS).",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create five additional residential units and would add a net additional 399sqm of residential floor space.",
    "Therefore the proposal would incur a charge of Â£9,975 and Â£49,875 based on the calculation of Â£25 per square metre and Â£125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
