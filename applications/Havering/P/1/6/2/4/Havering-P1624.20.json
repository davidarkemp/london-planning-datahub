    "The proposed front extension and first floor side/rear extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and conflicting roof forms, would appear incongruous and be an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden environment harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development  would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers at No.116 Squirrels Heath Lane, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed first floor flank windows would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause potential loss of loss of privacy from perceived over/inter-looking which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers at No.116 Squirrels Heath Lane, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Bansal (Agent) by e-mail on 23-12-20."
