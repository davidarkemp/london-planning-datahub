    "The front dormer would be placed on an extended roof that is unlawful so the front dormer has been assessed alongside the hip to gable roof extension and the rear dormer already built.  The development, in particular, the gabling of the roof by reason of its scale, bulk, mass and cumulative impact with the very large rear dormer appears as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature and unbalance the appearance of this pair of semi-detached bungalows within the street scene detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and materially harmful to the visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan."
