    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",

    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC33 and Draft Local Plan policy 24.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed on the approved plans and under Section 14 of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and Draft Local Plan policy 26.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61 and Draft Local Plan policy 34.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Construction Method statement shall include details of:",

    "The hard surface hereby approved (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding (Draft Local Plan Policy 32).",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall comply with Regulation 36 (2)(b) and Part G2 of the Building Regulations - Water Efficiency.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with Policy SI 5 of the London Plan.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, a scheme of hard and soft landscaping to include details of boundary treatment, which shall include indications of all existing trees and shrubs on the site, and details of any to be retained, together with measures for the protection in the course of development shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the development and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the hard and soft landscaping proposed.  Subm",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",

Your attention is drawn to the free professional service provided by the Metropolitan Police Designing Out Crime Officers for North East London, whose can be contacted via DOCOMailbox.NE@met.police.uk or 0208 217 3813  . They are able to provide qualified advice on incorporating crime prevention measures into new developments.",
    "This proposal would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create one additional residential unit and would add a net additional 66sqm of residential floor space.",
    "Therefore the proposal would incur a charge of £1,650 and £8,250 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
