    "The proposed development fails to provide any family units, contrary to Policy 5 of the Havering Local Plan. No justification has been provided for the departure from the recommended mix of dwelling types.",
    "The proposed flatted block by reason of its poor internal layout, single aspect nature, orientation of the rear flats, inadequate provision of amenity space, plus lack of defensible space to flat 2,would result in substandard residential accommodation for future residents contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed flatted block would not provide step free access for future residents and therefore fails to achieve the highest standards of accessible and inclusive design, in the absence of any justification the proposals are contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies D5 and D7 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed flatted block would, through its height, bulk and projection beyond the rear upper floor building line of the unattached neighbour no. 96 Mawney Road, form an intrusive and unneighbourly development and have an adverse effect on the amenity of these adjacent occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Local Plan Policy 7. There would also be conflict with paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for future users of development.",
    "The proposed detached bungalow, due to its limited storage space, awkward relationship with the flatted block and shared site access / parking area would result in substandard residential accommodation for the future residents with poor outlook and lack of defensible space to the front of the bungalow, contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its layout, result in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Policy 35 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy T7 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: the agent was made aware of the numerous concerns the Council had with the scheme, however, the agent submitted revisions to the scheme, these were not considered to be sufficient to overcome the Council's concerns and so the Council decided to proceed to determine the application."
