    "The proposed outbuilding would through a combination of its overall scale, bulk and mass result in an incongruously large structure with no regard to the pre-eminence of the main house, which through its close relationship to the main dwelling would contribute to a sprawling effect invasive to the garden character of the Conservation Area and detrimental to its character and appearance. As such the development would fail to preserve the character or appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The development would conflict with policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the objectives of the NPPF. The development also fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Gidea Park Conservation Area, therefore contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing.  The revisions involved setting back the outbuilding into the rear garden in order to prevent sprawling effect. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
