    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The proposed development would by reason of its scale, bulk and mass and taking into account existing additions and historic development at the site, by way of the cumulative impact result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building. The development would therefore be inappropriate development within the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposals are therefore contrary to the objectives of the NPPF and London Plan (Policy G2).",
    "The proposed first floor extension would dominate and detract from the character of the original house through the overall width of the first floor extension and lack of articulation. Furthermore the development would introduce an unsympathetic design feature in the crown roof which would exacerbate the harm identified. The proposals are therefore contrary to the objectives of the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016 and 2031 and the NPPF specifically Para 134.",
