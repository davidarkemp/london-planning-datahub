  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would result in poor living conditions that do not offer a suitable quality living environment for future occupiers. The constraints of the site in conjunction with the design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers. The proposal fails to provide private outdoor spaces for the either of the dwellings. The design would offer substandard living conditions for future occupants, in direct contrast to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5, the Housing SPG, the Residential Design SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of the layout and access of the vehicle parking and front door via a gate on the neighbouring property, fail to offer a safe and practical access arrangement to the ground floor flat for pedestrians, vehicles and cyclists, resulting in an unsatisfactory relationship to the detriment of amenity and contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to agent via email on 5/1/21.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be Â£10,200. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
