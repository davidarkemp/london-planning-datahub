    "The detached dwelling would, by reason of its excessive bulk, mass and scale on a constrained plot with no side setbacks and within close proximity of the front boundary, appear as an incongruous and cramped development in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area and inconsistent with the prevailing character of development in the local area.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers. The design approach adopted would be to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers as it provides poor outlook from the main ground floor habitable room, to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of this proposed 3-bed dwelling.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its positioning of openings and proximity to neighbouring properties would be an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly development that would have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of these adjacent occupiers resulting in overlooking contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive bulk, mass, scale and design approach built up to the site boundaries result in a visually intrusive, unsightly and dominant development that would be harmful to outlook from neighbouring properties and contribute to an increased sense of enclosure, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",

    "Mayoral CIL contribution of £250 (x £25 per sqm).",
