    "The provision of a roof-light in the side roof slope would be highly visible in the street-scene and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and is therefore, contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and consequently Policy 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. With regards to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the level of harm to the Conservation Area is considered less than substantial, which enacts Paragraph 196. It is not considered that any heritage or public benefit would outweigh the harm identified.",
