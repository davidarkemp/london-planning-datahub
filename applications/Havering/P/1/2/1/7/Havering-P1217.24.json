    "The proposed development, by reason of noise and disturbance caused by the opening hours of the premises, the provision of an outdoor seating area, increase in traffic entering and leaving the premises, vehicles including those of delivery drivers parking and manoeuvring, particularly during the evening hours of operation, would be detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby residential properties, in particular the flat above the premises, contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7, 26 and 34, and London Plan (2021) policies D14 and T6.",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the noise and odour impact. In the absence of this information, it is therefore considered that the proposed development use would, by reason of its location and relationship to nearby sensitive receptors, in particular residential properties above and adjacent to the premises on Straight Road, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance from the ventilation equipment associated with the use and potential odour from cooking smell which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 34.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on-site car parking provision for customers and delivery drivers, as well as lack of designated parking for goods delivery, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity. The proposed off-street parking arrangements without acceptable vehicular access would fail to safeguard the safety and comfort of pedestrians and cyclists and would be detrimental to traffic safety and increase road danger on Straight Road and Faringdon Avenue. The proposals would be detrimental to the safe and efficient operation of buses on the busy junction contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policies T3, T4 and T7 of the London Plan 2021 and paragraph 104 of the NPPF (2021).",
