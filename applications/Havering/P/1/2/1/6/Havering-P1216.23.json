    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its cramped nature within the plot, close proximity to the shared boundaries and location within the rear garden environment of Cotleigh Road, would appear as an isolated and visually cramped form of development that would be at odds with the established local pattern of development at the rear of Cotleigh Road. This, together with its poor architectural design, would result in it appearing out of character with the established design of surrounding dwellings, contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 as well as Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed dwelling would form a visually intrusive and overbearing feature from adjacent rear gardens of nos. 20, 22 and 24 Cotleigh Road, detrimental to neighbouring amenity and would therefore be contrary to Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. There would also be conflict with paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework which seeks to ensure a high standard of amenity for existing and future occupiers.",
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its proximity to the rear garden environment of nos. 20, 22 and 24 Cotleigh Road, cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of these neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policies 7 and 10 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
