    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed on the plans approved as part of this application, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document",
    "No works shall take place in relation to the paving of the front forecourt hereby approved until detailed specification of surface water drainage works (drainage channel and soakaway) are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Surface water drainage shall be provided in accordance with the approved details. The drainage/soakaway shall be designed so as not to impede use of the ramp for disability access for people using wheelchairs or other similar mobility devices.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Surface water drainage works are required on site to prevent the risk of flooding.  Submission of a scheme prior to commencement will ensure that the measures to be employed are technically sound and don't impact the use of the ramp for disability access and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC49 and DC61.",
    "The hard surface hereby approved (including any sub-base) shall be made of porous materials or provision shall be made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure no water run-off from the hard surface which would contribute to risk of flooding",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email. The revisions involved removal of the trellis on the side boundary. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 6/9/2021."
