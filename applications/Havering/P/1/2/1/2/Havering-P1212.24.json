    "The proposed rear dormer window, by reason of its position within the rear roof slope and close proximity to the rear gardens of the neighbouring properties nos. 27 and 28 Sudbury Close, would result in an overbearing impact and sense of enclose to these neighbouring occupants, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The solar panels, which are to be retained according to condition 31 of P1451.10 and Q0275.13 would also be lost.  The long term energy efficiency of the units approved using renewable energy technology would be severely compromised as a result.",
