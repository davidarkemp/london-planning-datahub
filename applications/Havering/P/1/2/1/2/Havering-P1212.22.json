  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of the 3rd of February 2017.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.",
    "The development shall be carried out in accordance with the Contaminated Land reports approved under applications ref. Q0299.19 Granted on 08.01.20, Q0181.22 Granted on 01.09.22 and Q0261.22 Granted on 21.09.22 unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure the safety of the occupants of the development hereby permitted and the public generally.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the external materials listed within the Schedule of Materials document dated July 2022 and the development shall be implemented as per the details unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The scheme of hard landscaping shown on approved drawing 1333-PVOC-1 shall be completed before the development is occupied. All planting, seeding or turfing comprised within the scheme shall be carried out in the first planting season following completion of the hard landscaping and any trees or plants which within a period of 5 years from completion of the development die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of a similar size and species, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the development accords with the Local Plan policies 27 and 30.",
    "The development shall be carried out in accordance with the details of all walls, fences and boundary treatment previously approved under application reference Q0299.19.  Such measures shall be installed prior to first occupation and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with Local Plan policies 7 and 26.",
    "The development shall be carried out in accordance with the details of vehicle cleansing facilities approved under application ref. Q0299.19 Granted 08.01.20 unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",

    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with Local Plan policy 35.",
    "The building shall not be occupied until secure storage for 13 cycles is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:",
    "The submitted proposals for cycle parking show an insufficient provision of spaces. Submission of a revised scheme for cycle parking prior to occupation is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",

    "The buildings shall also be constructed so as to provide sound insulation of 45 DnT, w + Ctr dB (minimum value) against airborne noise  and 62LnT, w dB (maximum values) against impact noise.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties in accordance with Local Plan policies 7 and 34 and London Plan policies D13 and D14.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order), no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",

    "With regards to surface water drainage it is the responsibility of the developer to make proper provision for drainage to ground, water courses or a suitable sewer.  In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of Ground Water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required.  They can be contacted on 0845 850 2777.",
    "The Applicant is advised that planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway.

    "This proposal would be liable for a Mayoral and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy payment as it would create seven additional residential units and would add a net additional 484sqm of floor space.",
    "Therefore the proposal would incur a charge of £12,100 and £60,500 based on the calculation of £25 per square metre and £125 per square metre, subject to indexation.",
    "The applicant's attention is drawn in particular to condition numbers 12 and 14 above. Failure to comply with this condition may well result in enforcement proceedings being taken against you."
