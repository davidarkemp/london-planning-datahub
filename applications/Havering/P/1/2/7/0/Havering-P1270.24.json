    "The dwelling would form an incongruous feature in the garden-scene and would not reflect the design and built form",
    "of the development within the context of the rear garden environment. As such it is considered that the proposed dwelling would appear conspicuous and incongruent feature in the area, visually cramped within the site and would significantly harm its character and appearance.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would result in a poor quality living environment for future occupiers. The design approach adopted would provide poor outlook from the bedroom resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants of this proposed dwelling.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development by reason of inadequate information with regards to visibility splays, turning areas and fire emergency vehicle access have been provided so it has not been demonstrated that vehicles can safely access and exit the site to ensure that there is no impacts on pedestrian and highway safety as well as emergency access contrary to Local Plan policies 10, 23 and 24 as well as the London Fire Brigade Fire Safety Guidance Note: Access for Fire Appliances (2022).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "Mayoral CIL contribution of £1275 (x £25 per sqm).",
    "Havering CIL contribution of £6375 (x £125 per sqm)",
