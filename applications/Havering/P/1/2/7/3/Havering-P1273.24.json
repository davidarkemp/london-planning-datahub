    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the development by virtue of its use and scale including proposed occupancy/levels of staffing would not be at odds with the suburban nature of its surroundings and would not result in undue harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers through comings and goings, turnover of staff and residents in a manner distinguishable from the use of the property as a single dwelling house. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 6, 7, 24, and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and Policies H12 of the London Plan as well as the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "The site is not well served by public transport. The applicant has not demonstrated that proposed use would not lead to increased comings and goings to the site over and above that of a single dwelling house and that an adequate degree of visitor and carer parking facilities would be provided. Therefore as a consequence this would result in an adverse impact on the safety and convenience of the local highway network through exacerbating pedestrian-vehicular conflict along pavements and traffic congestion within the area. As such there would be conflict with Policy 6 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, Policy T6 of the London Plan as well as the objectives of the NPPF.",
