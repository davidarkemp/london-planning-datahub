  "description": "Conversion of roof space to habitable use, to include a rear dormer, existing dormer extension, 2 no. front rooflights, hip to gable roof conversion and a single storey side extension. Installation of new vehicle crossover to the front and removal of part front garden wall.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would not be subservient to the roof of the property, would alter the basic shape of the roof on the semi-detached house which is unacceptable as it leads to an imbalance between the pair and creates a visually heavy roof to one half causing a negative effect on the street scene by the loss of symmetry. Accordingly the proposal is of a poor quality design which is contrary to the purposes and intent of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan",
    "The proposed rear dormers by virtue of their combined size, scale and bulk, would accentuate the unbalance of the pair properties and accordingly would appear incongruous and out of keeping with the street scene and character of the area, contrary to the purposes and intent of Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent Alexandre Piacsek via email on the 30/10/20."
