    "The proposed rear roof alterations would create a visual bulk at a high level and reduce the separation distances between the site and its immediate neighbours at roof level in a manner which would be inconsistent with the local character and detrimental to visual amenity of the locality. The poor design and scale of the dormers would appear as an incongruous addition, out of scale and character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area. In this regard the proposals are contrary to the guidance set out in the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, and Policies 7 and 26 set in Havering Local Plan 2021, as well as the NPPF which requires fundamentally at Para 130 that development add to the overall quality of the area and maintain a strong sense of place.",
