    "It is considered that the proposed side dormer windows by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk, mass would appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the street and rear garden environment contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "The proposed side dormer windows in conjunction with the existing hipped roof being gabled would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document 2008, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011.",
    "In granting the consent on the appeal for the front porch and single storey rear extension, the Planning Inspector has not imposed a contaminated land condition, although, all relevant measures should be undertaken when implementing the proposal for the ground floor rear extension and front porch under relevant building regulations to protect the occupiers of the application dwelling.",
