    "The proposed development, in particular the two storey rear extension would, by reason of its depth, height and position close to the boundary of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers on No.54 Brookside, Hornchurch contrary to Policies 7 and 26  of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
