    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan) shall be formed in the flank walls of the building unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",

    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the development achieves a satisfactory level of landscape quality throughout.",
    "The doors located in the ground floor south facing elevation of the annexe extension which replace windows permitted in the original scheme shall be used only in emergencies and shall not at any time be used in lieu of other access to the rooms they serve.",
    "Reason:- In the interests of preventing nuisance to surrounding occupiers.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing. A roof plan and revised floor plan to reflect elevation drawings was requested. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 10-11-2022"
