    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice); unless where otherwise required by another condition.",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a Construction Method Statement to control the adverse impact of the development on the amenity of the public and nearby occupiers (specifically the adjacent High School) is submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Construction Method statement shall include details of:",

    "Before any above-groundworks for the development hereby permitted commence on site, written specification of external walls, windows, doors, and roof materials to be used in the construction of the building(s) (including the outbuildings) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used. Submission of a written specification prior to any above ground works will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for refuse and recycling facilities shall be laid out and provided to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced in accordance with the drawings. All hard surfaces provided to the front of the dwellings hereby approved shall be made of porous materials and/or provision made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse. The parking area shall be retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety and flooding.",
    "All dwellings hereby approved shall be constructed to comply with Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations - Accessible and Adaptable Dwellings.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to comply with Policy DC7 of the Local Development Framework and Policy 3.8 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed windows on the side elevations on the building hereby approved shall be permanently glazed with obscure glass not less than Level 3 on the standard scale of obscurity and shall thereafter be maintained.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The proposed windows in the first floors side elevations of the building shall be non-opening below 1.7m of the floor of the room from which it serves, and shall thereafter be maintained.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of privacy, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 [as amended] the outbuildings hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, - or any other development order - other than porches erected in accordance with the Order, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouses hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development, and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 [as amended].",
    "The application proposes an additional residential unit, and an increase in the floor space of approximately 27sqm, and would be liable for mayoral CIL and Havering CIL. The site lies in the north (Zone A) Havering CIL charging area, and therefore would have a Havering CIL liability of £21,375 (171sqm x £125/sqm), and a Mayoral CIL liability of £4,275 (171sqm x £25/sqm) subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website. You are also advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the appropriate document templates at http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/",
    "Before occupation of the residential/ commercial unit(s) hereby approved, it is a requirement to have the property/properties officially Street Named and Numbered by our Street Naming and Numbering Team.  Official Street Naming and Numbering will ensure that that Council has record of the property/properties so that future occupants can access our services.  Registration will also ensure that emergency services, Land Registry and the Royal Mail have accurate address details.  Proof of having officially gone through the Street Naming and Numbering process may also be required for the connection of utilities. For further details on how to apply for registration see:",
