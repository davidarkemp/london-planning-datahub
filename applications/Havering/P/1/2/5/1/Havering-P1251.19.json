    "The proposed development would by virtue of their excessive protrusion, poor design, scale and mass lack subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The rear extensions would, by reason of their excessive scale, siting and position be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable overbearing effect and sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, loss of privacy and be harmful to the amenity of No. 134 Lynton Avenue contrary to policy DC61 of the Adopted Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the Adopted Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Ms Kenny Wilkins by e-mail on 11/11/2019."
