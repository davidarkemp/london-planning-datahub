    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted commences details of a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by  the local planning authority which specifies the provisions to be made for the control of noise emanating from the site. Such scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application with regards to the transmission of noise and vibration from any mechanical ventilation system installed. Submission of this detail prior to commencement of the use will prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties, protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises and ensure that the development accords with Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Before any works commence a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:  Insufficient information has been supplied with the application with regards to a scheme for any new plant or machinery. Submission of this detail prior to commencement of the use will prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties, protect the amenity of occupiers of nearby premises and ensure that the development accords with Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Notwithstanding the plans hereby approved, this consent solely relates to the external alterations and plant as described in the decision notice and not for advertisement consent.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt as to the proposal hereby approved.",
    "A fee is required when submitting details pursuant to the discharge of conditions.  In order to comply with the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012, (as amended), a fee of £116 per request or £34 where the related permission was for extending or altering a dwellinghouse, is needed.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
