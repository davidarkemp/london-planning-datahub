    "The proposed development would fail to provide adequate internal space for future occupants, in conflict with the indoor space standards outlined in Policy D6, including Criteria 1, of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7 the Havering Local Plan 2016-2033, which would result in substandard residential accommodation detrimental to the amenity of the future residents.",
    "The proposed dwelling, through the site layout and plot coverage, would form an incongruous and visually cramped form of development at odds with surrounding character and patterns of development in an environment of more consistent plot sizes. It would result in a property which would be at odds with this prevailing character. This out of character appearance would also be emphasised by the relatively narrow width of the bungalow in combination with its overall height and shape. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 10, 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph135(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed rear garden area, by reason of its orientation, separation distance and relationship with no.2 Tennyson Road, would experience direct and an unacceptable level of overlooking from the donor dwelling, contrary to Policies 7, 10, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed parking bay would not meet the required dimensions outlined within the parking standards resulting in overhang to the public walkway. Therefore, the proposal cannot demonstrate that adequate provision for parking can be provided against Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mohammad Shafique via email on 14/11/2024."
