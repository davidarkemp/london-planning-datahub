    "The proposed depth of the forecourt would result in an unacceptable parking arrangement, which would result in an increased parking congestion in surrounding streets detrimental to the safety and operation of the surrounding highway network contrary to Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan and paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application.",
