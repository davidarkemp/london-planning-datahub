    "The proposed extensions and alterations to facilitate the proposals including front extension, front and rear dormers and combined ground and first floor rear extensions would be of poor design cumulatively and would dominate the original dwelling, lacking subservience and would be detrimental to local character, the street-scene and rear garden environment more generally thereby contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 26, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD and Para 135 of the NPPF which requires development add to the overall quality of the area.",
    "The combined development at the rear of the property through increased ground floor footprint, first floor projection and large flat roofed dormer over would give rise to a sense of enclosure for the neighbouring premises and would unduly harm outlook from the rear/garden environment of each whilst presenting as visually dominant. The development cumulatively then would have an overbearing impact detrimental to the amenity of those occupants and contrary to the guidance contained within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, the objectives of Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the Framework at Para 135 which requires development provide a high standard of amenity.",
