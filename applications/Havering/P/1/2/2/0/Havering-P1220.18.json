  "description": "Variation of condition 6 of planning application P0617.14 to use the flat roof of the existing single storey rear extension as a roof garden in connection with the day nursery between 08:00 and 17:00 Monday to Friday, with screening, canopy and external alterations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The canopy roof and screening, by reason of their materials and prominent siting, appear as an incongruous addition to the existing property and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment harmful to the existing reasonable residential amenity of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the adopted London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2011.",
    "The use of the flat roof of the existing single storey rear extension as a roof garden in connection with the day nursery would, combined with its elevated position, proximity to neighbouring properties and low level of screening, cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, particularly to the flats at No. 59 Eastern Road and give rise to significant levels of noise and disturbance harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the adopted London Borough of Havering's LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to SIG Design via email on 13th February 2019."
