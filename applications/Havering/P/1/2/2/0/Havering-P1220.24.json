    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive overall bulk, mass and extensive pitched roof form, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development, which would be most oppressive and give rise to an undue sense of enclosure to the detriment of residential amenity especially those occupiers of no.15 and no.19 King Edward Avenue, contrary to policies 7, 26 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The proposed two-storey dwelling, by reason of its bulk, scale, mass and design, unacceptably harm the character of both the subject building itself and the street scene more generally. It therefore conflicts with the objectives of policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.It furthermore conflicts with the National Planning Policy Framework to secure high quality design that maintains or enhances the character and appearance of the local area.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Michael Winsley, by email on 14.10.2024."
