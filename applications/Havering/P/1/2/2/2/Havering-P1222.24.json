    "The proposed studio flat would fail to provide adequate internal space for future occupants and does not demonstrably provide adequate internal floor to ceiling height, in conflict with the indoor space standards outlined in Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7 the Havering Local Plan 2016-2033, which would result in substandard residential accommodation detrimental to the amenity of the future residents.",
    "The lack of amenity space for the proposed flats would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed extension to the dormer through its design and mass would appear at odds with the existing pattern of development for rear dormers in the locality, which are characterised by modest width. The proposals would therefore be considered incongruous and in conflict with Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed loft studio would, by reason of its living quarters abuting the bedrooms of the adjacent dwellings, result in an unacceptable level of noise disturbance to the adjacent occupiers, particularly no.191A St Marys Lane, contrary to the provisions of Policy 9 and 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Ivan Jaffa via email on 24/10/24.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £450 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £2250 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
