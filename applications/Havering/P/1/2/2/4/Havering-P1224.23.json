    "The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk, mass at first-floor level, would constitute as a dominant and visually intrusive form of development within the street scene that would close down the characteristic gap at first-floor level between detached properties and side boundaries along Slewins Lane, thereby harming the appearance of the host dwelling within the surrounding street scene, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed extension to the existing loft conversion, by reason of its bulk, scale and mass, would occupy an unacceptably large area of the rear roof slope, thereby forming an incongruous and visually jarring feature that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property from within the rear garden scene, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its depth and projection beyond the neighbouring property no. 19 Slewins Lane at ground floor level, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development that would have an adverse effect on the amenity of these adjacent occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
