    "The proposed development would, by reason of its site coverage, proximity to the boundaries of the site, height, bulk and scale, result in a cramped and awkward form of development, which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 26 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its site constraints, location, setting, the shallow and inadequate provision of external amenity space, limited outlook, aspect, sense of enclosure and relationship to adjoining uses would materially harm the living conditions of future occupiers, which would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would due to the siting, orientation of the site in conjunction with the site coverage, the proposed layout, scale, mass, height and design, would be an unneighbourly, overbearing and an oppressive development which would result in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of adjacent occupiers (especially nos. 169 - 171 Victoria Road) contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal, having regard to the narrow access road, is able to make adequate provision for the servicing of the site, including adequate provision for refuse collection and access arrangements for emergency and rescue vehicles,  resulting in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Polices 24 and 35 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its siting, design and layout, establish a built form which would prejudice the comprehensive redevelopment of the adjoining sites. The development would therefore give rise to a poor quality, isolated and piecemeal development which would undermine the wider aspirations for the site and surrounding area contrary to Policy 10 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 03-10-2022.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £17,700.00. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
