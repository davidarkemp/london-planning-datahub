    "Notwithstanding the discrepancy between drawings, the proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk, mass and excessive depth, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Notwithstanding the discrepancy between drawings, the proposed two storey side / rear extension would, by reason of its excessive depth, height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development resulting in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to the occupiers of no.130, as well as having an adverse effect on the streetscene contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent (Mr Gabriel Kakanos) by email on 15th December 2020."
