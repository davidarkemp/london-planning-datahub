    "The original dwelling proposed to be subdivided does not measure more than 120sq.m and would result in the loss of a family unit, without the provision of a three bedroom unit. It is therefore considered that the proposal would be in conflict with Criteria ii. and iii. of Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2035 and would therefore not be acceptable in principle.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide adequate internal floor space and high quality external amenity space that is not significantly overlooked for future occupants, in conflict with the indoor space standards outlined in Policy D6, including Criteria 1 and 2, of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7 the Havering Local Plan 2016-2033, which would result in substandard residential accommodation detrimental to the amenity of the future residents.",
    "The proposed room layout of the upper floor flat would conflict with the use of rooms on the upper floor of the dwelling at no.12, resulting in potential noise and disturbance to the existing occupiers to the detriment of their enjoyment of their dwelling contrary to Policies 7 and 9 of the Local Plan.",
    "The site has a PTAL rating of 1b which requires 0.5 parking spaces for a 1-bedroom dwelling. Given the proposal involves the conversion of a 2-bedroom dwelling into two self-contained 1-bedroom flats without providing any parking spaces, it is considered that the proposal cannot demonstrate that adequate provision for parking can be provided against Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to STATE WHO, HOW (EMAIL/PHONE/MEETING) AND WHEN."
