Such scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",

    "To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",
    "Before any works commence a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",

    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until a suitable mechanical ventilation system is installed in accordance with a scheme to control the transmission of noise and vibration which has been previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Thereafter, the equipment shall be properly maintained and operated in accordance with the scheme during normal working hours.",
