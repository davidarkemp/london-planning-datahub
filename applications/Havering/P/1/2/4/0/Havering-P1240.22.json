    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate and substandard provision of amenity space, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development does not conform to the minimum floor to ceiling height measurements as outlined within the NDSS standards and would provide substandard living space for any future occupants, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "Insufficient details relating to parking, access and visibility has been provided for the application. Due to limited information relating to visibility plays, the development would be to the detriment of the safety of other road users and pedestrians, contrary to Policy 24 of the Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development would result in an unacceptable impact to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers and would represent the loss of light and privacy, and would unduly overbear upon neighbouring dwellings/gardens, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development, due to its excessive site coverage and the proximity of the ground floor main habitable room windows to the rear and side boundary of the site would result in poor outlook and aspect to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers resulting in substandard residential accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Local plan.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be Â£1987.75 based on the calculation of Â£25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of Â£989.75 based on calculation of ?Â£125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
