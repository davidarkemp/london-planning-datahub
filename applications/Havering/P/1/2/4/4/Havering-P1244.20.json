    "The proposal by reason of its scale and particularly the rear fenestration which includes a door providing access to the rear alleyway, is tantamount to the creation of a new and separate dwelling unit which would have negative impact on the character of the area and the residential amenity of neighbouring properties contrary to DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document (adopted 2008), the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Olanrewaju Yekinni via email on 10th November 2020."
