  "description": "Hip to gable end rear dormer, single storey rear extension with a depth of 5m and double storey front extension as per drawings.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height, depth and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of the attached neighbour at no. 97 Suttons Avenue, contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD (adopted 2008).",
    "The proposed development of the hip to gable loft conversion, rear dormer and double storey front extension would result in the unbalancing of the semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene that would be out of character and harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Havering's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (adopted 2011) and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to Mr  Dhesi, via email on 26 October 2020."
