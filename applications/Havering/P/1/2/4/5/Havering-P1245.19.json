    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no permitted change of use of the building from the aforementioned shall take place without the express planning permission of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to those compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application, and that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby permitted, a travel plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The travel plan, as submitted, shall follow the current Travel Plan Development Control Guidance issued by Transport for London and will include:",
    "(1) Targets for sustainable travel arrangements;",

    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed windows at first floor level and the rooflights at second floor level to the flank elevation facing 81-85 Balgores Lane shall be permanentely glazed with obscure glass and therefore be maintained and permanetly fixed shut to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",

    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved (except works required to secure compliance with this condition) until the following Contaminated Land reports (as applicable) are submitted to and approved in writing by  the Local Planning Authority:",
    "a) A Phase I (Desktop Study) Report documenting the history of this site, its surrounding area and the likelihood of contaminant/s, their type and extent incorporating a Site Conceptual Model.",

An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",
    "c) A Phase III (Risk Management Strategy) Report if the Phase II Report",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a scheme for the protection of  trees on the adjacent site has been submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Such scheme shall contain details of the erection and maintenance of fences or walls around the trees, details of underground measures to protect roots, the control of areas around the trees and any other measures necessary for the protection of the trees. Such agreed measures shall be implemented before development commences and kept in place until the approved development is completed.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate how the preserved trees on site will be adequately protected during construction.  Submission of details prior to commencement will ensure that the measures to be employed are robust.",
    "Changes to the public highway (including permanent or temporary access)",
    "- Planning approval does not constitute approval for changes to the public highway. Highway Authority approval will only be given after suitable details have been submitted considered and agreed. If new or amended access is required (whether temporary or permanent), there may be a requirement for the diversion or protection of third party utility plant or highway authority assets and it is recommended that early involvement with the relevant statutory undertaker takes place. The applicant must contact Engineering Services on 01708 433751 to discuss the scheme and commence the relevant highway approvals process. Please note that unauthorised work on the highway is an offence.",

    "As the site is adjacent to Network Rail's operational railway infrastructure, it is strongly recommended that the developer contacts assetprotectionanglia@networkrail.co.uk prior to any works commencing on site and agree an Asset Protection Agreement to enable approval of detailed works.  More information, in respect of this, can be obtained from www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/1538.aspx.",
