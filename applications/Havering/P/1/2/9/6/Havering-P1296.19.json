    "The proposed rear dormer would by virtue of it's excessive protrusion, scale and mass lack subservience to the existing dwelling and would appear incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed development of the hip to gable loft conversion would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, result in an unbalancing of the semi-detached pair and appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Michael at Spaces Architecture by e-mail on 29/01/2020."
