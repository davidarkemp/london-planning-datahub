    "The proposed front boundary fence and gate, would by reason of its height, design and materials, form an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature, harmful to the appearance of the street scene and detracting from the open character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Plan Document 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments.  However, the applicant declined to do so and an appeal against non-determination has now been lodged, such that the Local Planning Authority is unable to progress this further."
