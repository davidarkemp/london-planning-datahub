    "The part extension to the front, by reason of its depth, siting and position close to the boundaries of the site is harmful to the character and appearance of the subject property and the wider streetscene, as well as materially harmful to the  amenity of the occupiers of the ground floor flat at No. 141 Hornchurch Road by virtue of its height, bulk and proximity to the main habitable room window, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of its location and relationship to neighbouring properties, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance caused by levels of activity, delivery and vehicle movements and associated plant and machinery within the premises and combined with the proposed hours of use, be unacceptably detrimental to the amenities of occupiers of adjacent residential properties, particularly the two flats at No. 141 Hornchurch Road contrary to Policies 7 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy, D14 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Utilising the front garden of No. 141 Hornchurch Road for parking and as a forecourt/manoeuvring area in connection with the proposed use would be harmful to the amenity of occupiers of no.141 by reason of noise, disturbance and obstruction of their access and would also result in the loss of off street car parking provision for the two flats at No. 141 Hornchurch Road, which is likely to result in increased parking congestion in surrounding streets contrary to Policies 7 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, T6.1 of the London Plan and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Alan Furze via email on 4th January 2024."
