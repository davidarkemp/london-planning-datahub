    "The proposed dwelling would through the constrained proportions of the site and limited plot size, inappropriate design and appearance appear as a disproportionately narrow feature in the street-scene. Through limited separation from shared boundaries and the limited plot size the development would read as a cramped overdevelopment of the site. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the area and prevailing pattern of development contrary to policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD. There would also be conflict with Paragraph 124 of the National Planning Policy Framework which requires that development should take into account the desirability of maintaining an area's prevailing character and setting",
    "The scale, bulk and mass of the proposed dwelling and close proximity to neighbouring properties would give rise to increased levels of overlooking, loss of privacy as well as representing an intrusive and overbearing feature as a separate unit of accommodation contrary to the Residential Design SPD and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Paragraph 130(f) of the National Planning Policy Framework which requires that development creates places which provide a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",

This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development. Based upon calculations undertaken by the case officer and information supplied with the application your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £1500 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 60 square metres -",

Consideration was given to seeking fruther amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 26-08-2021"
