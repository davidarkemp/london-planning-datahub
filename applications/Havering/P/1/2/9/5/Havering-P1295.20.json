    "The proposed development would by reason of the bulk and mass, lack of subservience, excessive width and awkward design appear visually incongruous in relation to the host property, as well as being visually intrusive in the street scene, detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality in contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The application does not provide sufficient information for the impact of the development on the trees adjacent to the western site boundary, within the grounds of Corbets Tey School, to be fully considered and assessed.  In the absence of such information, the Local Planning Authority cannot be sure the development will not result in adverse impact on the trees within the adjacent site or assess the amenity impacts of this.",
