    "The proposed replacement roof, by reason of its bulk and volume, would together with the previous extensions to the dwelling result in a disproportionate addition to the original building over and above its original form and would therefore materially harm the character and openness of the Metropolitan Green Belt.  No very special circumstances to justify such harm have been submitted with the application. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework and Policy G2 of the London Plan.",
