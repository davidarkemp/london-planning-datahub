    "The proposed development would be overdevelopment for the site, and would be out of character for the area. The proposed development is therefore unacceptable when assessed against policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), and policies CP17, DC32, DC33 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed access to the site is inadequate in terms of width (too narrow), and length (too far from the highway). This has implications for any proposed building in terms of design, the quality of the proposed living accommodation, servicing, waste and refuse collection, access in case of emergency, and for all transport matters (including parking) as well as determining if any proposed unit would integrate into the existing residential units and the area more generally. The proposed development is therefore unacceptable when assessed against policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 (MALP), and policies CP17, DC32, DC33 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
