  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Except in relation to condition 3 below, the extension hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the extension is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Notwithstanding the details on the approved plans, planning permission is granted only for the rear extension as described in the application form. No permission is granted in relation to any raised patio area - this was not included on the description of development on the form and there is insufficient details on the plans to assess the impact of any such raised area. For information, any raised patio area greater than 0.3 metres height above existing ground level would require planning permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "A raised patio area is not included in the application form description of development. The plans contain insufficient information to assess the impact of such a proposal and as it is not in the description of development, adjoining occupiers have not been given the opportunity to make representations on its merits or otherwise.",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019."
