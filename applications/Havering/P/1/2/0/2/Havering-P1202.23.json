    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The premises shall only accommodate a maximum of five persons (disregarding staff) aged between 16 and 21 receiving care at any given time unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and that the development accords with Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The use of the premises hereby permitted comprised of a C2 use shall only be used for the purposes of residential care and accommodation and not any other use falling within Class C2 of The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application.",
    "Occupants of the accommodation hereby permitted shall only have been referred to it from the London Borough Of Havering.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To enable the Local Planning Authority to monitor the use, to ensure that the service is benefiting Havering residents and in order that the development complies with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 6 which allows for appropriate housing to meet the specialist needs of local people.",
    "Within three months of the date of this decision, or prior to the use hereby permitted coming into use, the applicant shall submit for the approval of the Local Planning Authority details of cycle storage. Such measures as agreed shall then be installed within three months of the date of approval and shall thereafter be maintained permanently to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
