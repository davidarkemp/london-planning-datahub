    "The proposed development would, by reason of the proposed single aspect north facing flats, shallow north-facing front amenity spaces, creation of poor non-functional and enclosed private amenity space and lack of communal amenity area, limited light and outlook, aspect, sense of enclosure, privacy and relationship to the B8 use would result in substandard residential accommodation detrimental to the amenity of the future occupiers, which would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide a satisfactory proportion of family sized homes within the scheme and therefore does not comply with the aims of Local Plan policy 5 and London Plan policy H10.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the unsatisfactory parking arrangement would adversely impact on the living condition of the future occupier at Flat 1 of the proposed development, and in addition due to its  constraints result in an unsafe accessible parking space, which would have an unacceptable and detrimental impact on the safety of pedestrians and other road users and residential amenity, contrary to Policies D6 and T6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 13-10-2022.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £3,58 at a rate of £20 per sqm (179m² x 20).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £22,375.",
