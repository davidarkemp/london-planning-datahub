    "The proposal, by reason of the inadequate access and servicing arrangements fails to provide a sufficiently high quality of development.  The length and narrowness of the access would would not adequately serve the needs of future occupiers in terms of accessibility and manoeuvrability of vehicles and would lead to conflict between pedestrians and vehicles, as well as not demonstrably making adequate provision for the servicing of the site, including access for emergency vehicles or appropriate provision for refuse/recycling bin drop off due to the distance between the site and Oliver Road and the terrain of the road, contrary to Policy 7, 10, 24, 26 and Policy 35 of the Havering Local Plan",
    "In the absence of an arboricultural report, insufficient information has been submitted to determine the impact on the trees within the site.  The submission fails to demonstrate accurately the details of existing trees within the site or demonstrate that they can be successfully retained during the course of the development, contrary to Policy 27 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the poor quality access arrangements for future occupiers of the development, as well as the lack of sufficient information to demonstrate that the development will provide adequate levels of amenity, including adequate provision of internal daylight to the properties, would not give rise to a suitably high quality living environment for future occupiers of the development, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with by the agent via email in January 2023.  The improvements requested included an Arboricultural report.  The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £8405.50 based on the calculation of Ã???????£25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £42027.50 based on calculation of Ã???????£125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
