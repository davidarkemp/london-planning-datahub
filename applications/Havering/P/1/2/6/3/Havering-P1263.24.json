    "The original dwelling proposed to be subdivided does not measure more than 120sq.m and would result in the loss of a family unit, with no three bedroom unit proposed. It is therefore considered that the proposal would be in conflict with Criteria ii. and iii. of Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2035 and would therefore not be acceptable in principle.",
    "The proposed dormer through its design and mass would appear at odds with the existing pattern of development for rear dormers in the locality, characterised by modest width. The proposals would therefore be considered incongruous and in conflict with Policies 7, 10 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and also Paragraph 130(a) of the NPPF which requires fundamentally that development add to the overall quality of the area whilst also establishing or maintaining a strong sense of place.",
    "The proposed development would lead to the main rear habitable room window in close proximity to the boundary fence to the amenity space to the upper floor flat providing very poor outlook and aspect from this habitable room, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupants of the ground floor apartment and would fail to accord with the provisions of Policies 7 and 9 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposal would fail to provide direct access to the external private amenity space from either flat and it would appear that the amenity space is not accesible for the upper flat around the side of the property, resulting in poor quality amenity space to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Naheem Ali via email on 17/12/2024."
