    "The proposed development, by reason of its design and location would require the repositioning of the existing pv panels located on the western elevation of the roof of the dwelling. No additional information was provided to demonstrate the newly arranged pv panels would contribute the same capacity for solar power generation. As such, this would inhibit the dwelling contributing to the agreed upon the required emissions reduction capacity of the Dovers Corner Industrial Estate as stipulated under Condition 13 of P0922.15 contrary to Policy SI 2 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 12 of the Local Plan.",

It would represent a visually intrusive form of development from the perspective of neighbours rear gardens materially harmful to the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area contrary to Policies 7 & 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2011).",
