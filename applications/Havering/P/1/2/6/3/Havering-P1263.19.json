    "Before the Multipurpose Hall is used as a Place or Worship, an assessment of the noise from the proposed development on residential properties shall be undertaken.  Following this, a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority which specifies the provisions to be made for the control of noise emanating from the Multipurpose Hall .  Such  scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first use of the Multipurpose Hall and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties and in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61",
    "The proposal may be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).

Based upon the information supplied with the application, £7,700 would be payable due to result in a chargeable floor area of 308m² of GIA, subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin.
