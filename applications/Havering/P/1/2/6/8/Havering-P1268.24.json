    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials described in the application form and Design and Access Statement (dated 16 December 2024) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The three outbuildings hereby permitted shall be used only in a capacity associated with the main planning use of the site as a training room, laundry and storage facilities as labelled on drawing no. LL-ZS-SC-S-102 Rev P06 only and shall be used for no other purposes unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To restrict the use of the premises to one compatible with the surrounding area and to enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control over any future use not forming part of this application.",
    "The proposals are liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL)",
    "The cumulative footprint of the outbuildings would be approx 130 square metres which translates the following CIL contributions and the relevant rates:",

    "MCIL - £25 per sqm  - £3,250",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.

    "(b) the planning authority has approved the plan.",
    "The planning authority, for the purposes of determining whether to approve a Biodiversity Gain Plan if one is required in respect of this permission would be the London Borough of Havering.",
