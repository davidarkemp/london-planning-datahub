    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed in the application form and photo submitted by the agent unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",

    "To restrict the use to one compatible with a residential area.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Homestead via email on September 21st 2022.
