The proposal would neither preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area and is therefore contrary to Policies 7, 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan Adopted November 2021 and Section 10 of the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document Adopted 2011.",
