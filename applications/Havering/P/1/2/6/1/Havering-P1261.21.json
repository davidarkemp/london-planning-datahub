In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of Ground Water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required.  They can be contacted on 0845 850 2777.",
