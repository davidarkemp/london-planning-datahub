    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.",
    "Prior to the commencement of the development hereby approved, details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to commencement will protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, the area set aside for car parking shall be laid out and surfaced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles visiting the site and shall not be used for any other purpose.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that car parking accommodation is made permanently available to the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority in the interest of highway safety.",
    "All off street residential car parking spaces must provide infrastructure for electric or Ultra-Low Emission vehicles. At least 1 space per property should have active charging facilities, with passive provision for all remaining spaces.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To minimise the impact of transport emissions on local air quality.",
    "No work shall be carried out on the site between the hours of 08.00 hours and 18.00 hours Mondays to Fridays, between the hours of 08.00 hours  and 13.00 hours on Saturdays unless agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority. No construction works or deliveries shall take place on Sundays, Bank or Public Holidays unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "The building(s) shall be so constructed as to provide sound insulation of 43 DNT,w + Ctr dB (minimum values) against airborne noise and 64 L 'nT,w dB (maximum values) against impact noise to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining neighbours.",
    "No building shall be occupied until refuse and recycling facilities are provided to the satisfaction of the Council. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of managing refuse and recycling at the site appropriately.",
    "No building shall be occupied until cycle storage is provided to the satisfaction of the Council. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no extension or enlargement (including additions to roofs) shall be made to the dwellinghouse(s) hereby permitted, or any detached building erected, without the express permission in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of amenity and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over future development.",
    "The internal layout of the dwelling should be designed, as far as practicable, so that in general the more sensitive living areas, in particular bedrooms are located on facades facing away from the noise source.",
    "Double-glazing 6mm.12mm.6mm with opening provided with pressure seals in either hardwood or UPVC frames, with acoustically treated trickle ventilators.",
    "A ventilation system that will involve ducting air through the houses, with fresh air obtained either through sound insulated air inlets or from inlets on the quieter side of the buildings.",
    "Before occupation of the residential/ commercial unit(s) hereby approved, it is a requirement to have the property/properties officially Street Named and Numbered by our Street Naming and Numbering Team.  Official Street Naming and Numbering will ensure that that Council has record of the property/properties so that future occupants can access our services.  Registration will also ensure that emergency services, Land Registry and the Royal Mail have accurate address details.  Proof of having officially gone through the Street Naming and Numbering process may also be required for the connection of utilities. For further details on how to apply for registration see:",

The revisions involved reducing the number of bedrooms within the proposed dwelling. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 21/11/2023."
