    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Prior to its installation the applicant shall submit for the approval of the Local Planning Authority the exact colour/finish of the proposed roller shutter door hereby permitted. The finish and appearance as agreed shall then be carried out on site and maintained thereafter.",
    "Reason:- In the interests visual amenity.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "The applicant is advised that this permission relates solely to the provision of a roller-shutter door to the existing unit for purposes of the existing lawful use of the site (as considered through the lawful development certificate under E0037.24). This permission does not extend to any proposed signage or any other use of the site than for that of plant sales and hire permitted through P1138.98. Any other use may be considered unlawful and requiring permission in its own right. Therefore any works undertaken to faciliate any use other than that outlined may potentially be unlawful and subject to enforcement action."
