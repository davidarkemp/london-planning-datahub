    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans, particulars and specifications (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "The Local Planning Authority consider it essential that the whole of the development is carried out and that no departure whatsoever is made from the details approved, since the development would not necessarily be acceptable if partly carried out or carried out differently in any degree from the details submitted.  Also, in order that the development accords with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Prior to the development being brought into use, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority for the installation of Ultra-Low NOx boilers with maximum NOx emissions less than 40 mg/kWh. Where any installations do not meet this emissions standard it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology as determined by a specialist to ensure comparable emissions. The installation of the boilers shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details and shall thereafter be permanently retained. Following installation emissions certificates will need to be provided to the Local Planning Authority to verify boiler emissions.",
    "Reason: To minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality.",
    "a)  Prior to the commencement of the development hereby approved, an Air Quality  Neutral Assessment shall be submitted to and agreed by the Local Planning Authority.  The assessment shall detail;",
    "·\tThe relevant benchmark for buildings for NO2 and PM10 at the site, based on its land use class and location;",
    "·\tThe NO2 and PM10 emissions from buildings and a comparison with the buildings benchmark;",
    "·\tThe relevant emission benchmark for transport for NO2 and PM10 at the site;",
    "·\tThe NO2 and PM10 emission from transport and a comparison with the transport benchmark;",
    "·\tShow that the building and transport emission benchmarks will be met in order to achieve air quality neutral requirements; and",
    "·\tMitigation (if required) or contribution to off-setting the development's emissions.",
    "b) The use hereby permitted shall not commence until all measures identified in the Air Quality Neutral Assessment have been shown to be implemented to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority in writing.",

    "Prior to the commencement of any works pursuant to this permission the developer shall submit for the written approval of the Local Planning Authority;",
    "a)     A Phase I (Desktop Study) Report documenting the history of the site, its surrounding area and the likelihood of contaminant/s, their type and extent incorporating a Site Conceptual Model.",
    "b)\tA Phase II (Site Investigation) Report if the Phase I Report confirms the possibility of a significant risk to any sensitive receptors.  This is an intrusive site investigation including factors such as chemical testing, quantitative risk assessment and a description of the sites ground conditions.  An updated Site Conceptual Model should be included showing all the potential pollutant linkages and an assessment of risk to identified receptors.",
    "c)\tA Phase III (Remediation Strategy) Report if the Phase II Report confirms the presence of a significant pollutant linkage requiring remediation.  A detailed remediation scheme to bring the site t",
    "a)        If, during development, contamination not previously identified is found to be present at the site then no further development (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority) shall be carried out until a remediation strategy detailing how this unsuspected contamination shall be dealt with has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The remediation strategy shall be implemented as approved.",
    "b)        Following completion of the remediation works as mentioned in (a) above, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out satisfactorily and remediation targets have been achieved.",
    "Reason:   To ensure that any previously unidentified contamination found at the site is investigated and satisfactorily addressed in order to protect those engaged in construction and occupation of the development from potential contamination.",
    "Before the development hereby permitted commences  details of a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by  the local planning authority which specifies the provisions to be made for the control of noise emanating from the site. Such scheme as may be approved shall be implemented prior to first occupation and thereafter retained in accordance with such details.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent   properties.",
    "Before any works commence a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent   properties.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until an external lighting plan has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The lighting shall be provided and operated in strict accordance with the approved scheme.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the impact arising from any external lighting required in connection with the building or use.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect residential amenity and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "No above ground works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until samples of all materials to be used in the external construction of the building(s) are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "It is noted that, the 'Area guidelines for SEND and alternative provision (building bulletin 104)' are provided by the Department for Education, with guidance on the area standards for such facilities. These guidelines are not within the planning remit and therefore have not been taken into consideration for the assessment of this scheme. However, it is encouraged that these guidelines are followed.",
    "It is requested that the school maintain an active and TfL STARS accredited travel, including the collection of annual modal shift data for at least 3 years following the occupation of the new building.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email. The revisions involved correcting some discrepancies in the plans, providing additional plans and revising the ramp at the entrance to a more practical design. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 25/09/21."
