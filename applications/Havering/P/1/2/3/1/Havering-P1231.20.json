  "description": "Part two storey side extension, part single storey side/rear extension involving conversion of garage to habitable use, and conversion of roof space to habitable use with dormer to rear, rear roof light and side roof light.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would by reason of the resulting excessive depth, lack of subservience, width and awkward design appear incongruous, prominent and visually intrusive in the rear garden environment and front street scene detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and visual amenity of the locality in contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "The proposed two storey side / rear extensions would, by reason of its excessive height, depth, bulk and proximity to the boundary, be unneighbourly which would give rise to an uncomfortable and overbearing effect resulting in an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, loss of sunlight and be harmful to neighbouring properties contrary to Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the London Borough of Havering Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Malcolm Clarke via email on 21st October 2020."
