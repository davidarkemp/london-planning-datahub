    "The first floor single bedroom would not be of a sufficient size for the intended occupant. The applicant has therefore not demonstrated that the property would be suitable for the intended occupiers in terms of the standard of facilities and the level of independence and there would then be conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 6(v).",
    "The development by virtue of its use and scale including proposed occupancy and overly intense operation would be at odds with the suburban nature of its surroundings and resulting in undue harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers from noise and disturbance associated with the comings and goings of the use contrary to Policies 6, 7, 16 and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies H12, S1 and S2 of the London Plan and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "It has not been robustly demonstrated that an adequate degree of carer and visitor parking facilities would be provided. As a consequence, the proposal is likely to result in increased parking congestion in surrounding streets, particularly given the relatively low accessibility of the site. The proposals have not demonstrated that the surrounding area is capable of accommodating increased demand for on-street parking without detriment to the amenity of surrounding occupants. Thus, the proposal is considered unacceptable, and would not be in accordance with Policies 6, 16 & 24 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy T6 of the London Plan, and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to LRJ Planning Ltd via email on 6th November 2024."
