    "The proposed development would appear out of character due to the narrower plot width compared with other dwellings in Woodlands Avenue, the width of the plot sizes would be less than 23m and the lack of sufficient setback at ground and first floor level from side boundaries would fail to accord with Sector 6 of the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD.  The proposed dwellings by reason of their narrow width, bulk and massing, in particular the bulk of the upper floors of Dwelling A, and would consequently appear out of character and incongruous in the rear garden scene, and the depths of the proposed new dwellings at ground, first floor and loft level would appear excessive and out of character in this context. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the Policy DC61 and DC69 of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (the Core Strategy), the Emerson Park Policy Area SPD, the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD, the Design SPD, the London",
    "The proposed development of two new dwellings gives rise to an intrusive, overbearing and unneighbourly form of development which would result in adverse amenity impacts to both adjoining neighbours at nos. 3 and 7 Woodlands Avenue as well as adverse amenity impacts to the future inhabitants of both Dwellings A and Dwelling B. resulting from the close relationship between flank windows, contrary to Policy DC61 of Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies and Development Plan Document (the Core Strategy), the Design SPD, the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF.",
    "While not reasons for refusal in their own right, the following should be noted if further applications are made. No internal storage space has been shown for Dwelling A, when a minimum of 3sqm is required, as outlined in the London Plan (adopted 2021).",
    "No section drawings have been supplied to measure the acceptability of the floor to ceiling heights. The minimum floor to ceiling height must be 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of the Gross Internal Area of each dwelling, in accordance with the London Plan (adopted 2021). Section drawings should be submitted if making another planning application.",
    "In the event that this application is allowed through the appeals process the proposals would be liable for the following CIL contributions:",
    "The proposals would incur a Mayoral CIL contribution of £2,644.25 at a rate of £25 per sqm (105.77m² x 25).",
    "The proposal is also liable for the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL), which has a charging rate of £125 per square metre of net additional floor space in Zone A. The Havering Community Infrastructure Levy contribution would equate to £13,221.25.",
    "Each contribution would be subject to indexation.",
