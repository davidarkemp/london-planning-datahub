    "The proposed development would, by reason of the height, bulk and mass of the roof, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its overall height, roof form, design, and proximity to neighbouring properties, appear as an obtrusive building viewed above the height of the existing fences and out of scale with the immediately adjoining rear garden environment.  This would have an adverse effect on the amenities enjoyed in the rear gardens of adjacent occupiers and is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant via telephone on 2 October 2015.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Settle and Green.  The revisions involved lowering the height of the proposed building and amendments to the roofline, as well as providing information regarding the proposed use.  Although some revisions were received, the applicant declined to make all of the suggested revisions."
