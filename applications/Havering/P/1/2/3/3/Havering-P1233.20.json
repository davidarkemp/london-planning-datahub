    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, total length and position, form an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature within the street, harmful to the appearance of the street scene and detracting from the open character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The boundary treatment, by reason of its height and position would impede the visibility for vehicles exiting from the site and from the neighbouring property at No.1 Tindall Close and for pedestrians approaching from either direction and would thereby be harmful to pedestrian comfort and highway safety contrary to Policy DC34 of the Local Development Framework and the guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Mr Gough by e-mail on 19-11-20."
