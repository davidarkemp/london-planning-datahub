  "description": "Proposed rear extension and alterations to subject dwelling.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, taking into account the existing additions and historic development at the site by way of the cumulative impact would result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building and therefore, would be inappropriate in principle within the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case which overcomes the harm identified and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CP14 and DC45 of the adopted LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan 2016 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed development would - by reason of its height, bulk and mass and inappropriate design - appear cumulatively as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature to the host building and to the area more generally, and would be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies D4 and D8 of the emerging Draft London Plan (\"Intend to Publish\" version December 2019), and policies CP17 and DC61 of the Havering Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008, and the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2008.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent/applicant in April 2019. The revisions involved lowering the ridge height of the proposed addition and revisiting the depth of the projection to the rear. The applicant declined to make the suggested revisions."
