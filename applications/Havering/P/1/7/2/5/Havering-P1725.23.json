The measurement position, assessment and definitions shall be made according to BS4142:2014 + A1:2019 \"Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound.",

The revisions involved relocating the flue following concerns that the initial proposal was adjacent to a bedroom window. Revised plans were received and neighbours were re-consulted. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 10/01/24."
