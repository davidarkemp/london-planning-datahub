  "description": "\"Proposed 3 x 3 bed and 1 x 2 bed terrace of houses and associated off-street car parking\" P1682.18 Conditions(s) Variation of Condition 2 (SC32)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed variations would materially change the consented scheme to the extent that the rationale which allowed planning permission to be granted under LPA reference P1682.18 dated 24th June 2019, would be severely diminished.  The increased scale, bulk and mass of the dwellings would exacerbate the visual impacts of the development and the isolated and potentially uncharacteristic nature of the development. Consequently the proposed dwellings would, by reason of their prominent rear garden location, height, bulk and mass, appear as an incongruous and unacceptably dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive features in the rear garden setting which would be harmful to the appearance and character of the surrounding area and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to the implementation of Policy DC61 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure contributions towards the demand for school places arising from the development, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the infrastructure impact of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policies DC29 and DC72 of the London Borough of Havering LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD 2008. and Policy 8.2 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reasons for it were given to the agent in writing 10-12-2019."
