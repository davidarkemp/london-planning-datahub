    "In the absence of details satisfactorily demonstrating that the loss of a specialist accommodation would not be prejudicial to the local community, the proposed development is contrary to Policy 6 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt, and the proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk, material, roof design and appearance, taking into account the site coverage of the front development would result in larger building over and above the size of the original building it replaces and therefore, would be inappropriate in principle within the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policies G2 of the London Plan 2021 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed rear development would, by reason of its site constraints, location, setting, the shallow and inadequate provision of external amenity space, limited outlook, aspect, sense of enclosure and proximity to adjoining boundaries would materially harm the living conditions of future occupiers, which would be contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The application fails to demonstrate that the proposal, having regard to the access road with no turning head circle, is able to make adequate provision for the servicing of the site, including adequate provision for refuse collection and access arrangements for emergency and rescue vehicles,  resulting in inadequate servicing arrangements contrary to Polices 24 and 35 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would due to the siting, orientation of the site in conjunction with the site coverage, the proposed layout, materiality, height and design, would be an unneighbourly, overbearing and an oppressive development which would result in a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of immediate adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be £28,950 subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
