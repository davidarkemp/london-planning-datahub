    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to ensure that the occupants of the development and property are not subject to any risks from soil gas and / or vapour in accordance with LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD Policy DC53.",
    "The A2 premises shall not be used for the purposes hereby permitted other than between the hours of 09:00 and 20:00 on Mondays to Fridays and not at all on Saturdays, Sundays, Bank or Public holidays without the prior consent in writing of the Local Planning Authority.",
