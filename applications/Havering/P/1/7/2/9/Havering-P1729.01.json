    "The proposal, by reason of the scale and height of the development and the cramped layout of the site, would constitute overdevelopment of this site, resulting in an intrusive development, out of scale and character with the surrounding area and detrimental to the visual amenity of occupiers of neighbouring property, contrary to Policy ENV1 of the Havering Unitary Development Plan.",
    "The proposal would, by reason of the position of the flats in relation to neighbouring residential properties, be overbearing and would also result in unacceptable overlooking of neighbouring dwellings, and vice versa, to the detriment of the privacy of existing and future residents, contrary to Policy ENV1 of the Havering Unitary Development Plan.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the degree of shortfall of private amenity space, would be prejudicial to the character and appearance of the property and the amenity of prospective occupiers of this and the recently constructed flats on this site, contrary to Policy ENV1 of the Havering Unitary Development Plan."
