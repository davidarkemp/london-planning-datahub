    "The provision of a rear terrace area would form an uncharacteristic and visually dominant feature harmful to the character and appearance of the subject dwelling and wider conservation area setting. As such the development would fail to preserve the character or appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area. The development would conflict with policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the objectives of the NPPF. The development also fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Gidea Park Conservation Area, therefore contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.",
    "The formation of a rear terraced area in this location would create an unneighbourly relationship between the subject dwelling and the surrounding environment in particular with regards to immediate neighbours through increased overlooking, loss of privacy to the detriment of their amenity and enjoyment of their homes therefore contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 and the aims and objectives of the NPPF, specifically Paragraph 130(f) which requires a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 17-11-2021."
