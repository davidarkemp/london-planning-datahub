    "The proposal by reason of its excessive depth and close proximity to the shared boundaries with Nos. 85 and 89 Whitchurch Road would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development resulting in a significant loss of  outlook, overbearing and potential loss of light to nearby occupiers.  As such, the proposal is contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
