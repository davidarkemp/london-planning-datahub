    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position and proximity along the common boundary to No. 23 Berwick Road significant reduce the availability of light into a habitable room (bedroom) window along the adjacent flank wall which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers of this property contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
