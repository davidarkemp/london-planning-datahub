    "The proposed development would, by reason of its position, height, bulk and mass in particular with respect to its roof-form, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area. Furthermore, the proposal by reason of its design with particular reference to the introduction of under-croft and use of the garden for parking purposes would be against the character of the development. It is therefore, considered that the proposal would not be in keeping with the character of the area with harmful visual impact contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the advice given the National Planning Policy Guidance 2019.",
    "The proposal gives rise to undersized and poor standard of accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers, in particular by reason of the insufficient gross internal floor area and the lack of amenity space afforded to the second floor flats. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 3.5 of The London Plan, Policies DC4 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate provision of amenity space, result in a cramped over-development of the site to the detriment of future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to policy DC61 of the of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed car parking layout is deigned in such a manor which would not allow the cars to manoeuvre within the site in order to entre and egress the site in a forward gear fashion. The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate sightline and insufficient on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and the free flow of traffic.",
    "Based upon the information supplied with the application, the proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) at the rate of £3675 (plus indexation) and would also attract a liability payment of £18,375 plus indexation in Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent of the application on 30th January 2020."
