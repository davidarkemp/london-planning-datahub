    "The scheme as shown on drawings submitted and observed through the combined loss of boundary treatment, increased hard-surfacing and loss of planting would detract from the green verdant character of the area, to the detriment of the special character and appearance of the Gidea Park Conservation Area.Accordingly the development fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and is therefore, contrary to Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and consequently Policy 28 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031. With regards to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the level of harm to the Conservation Area is considered less than substantial, which enacts Paragraph 196. It is not considered that any heritage or public benefit would outweigh the harm identified.",
