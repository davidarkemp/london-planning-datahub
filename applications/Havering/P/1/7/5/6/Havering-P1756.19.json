  "description": "The proposal is to use the site for the sale of outdoor cabins to include erection of metal security fence and dismantlable show cabins; two timber fence enclosure housing and two preparation work shops and an office.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The site is within the area identified as Metropolitan Green Belt. The Local Development Framework and Government Guidance as set out in the NPPF is that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that the new building will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances.  No very special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed change of use, including the sales buildings, sales forecourt, storage areas, surfacing and associated fencing, would by reason of the prominent location and setting, erode the openness of the area and increase the intrusion of built development into the countryside, resulting in considerable harm to the openness of the Green Belt, contrary to Policy DC45 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the provisions of the NPPF.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was considered that negotiation would not be appropriate in this case and the application should proceed directly to refusal, giving the applicant opportunity if so wished to appeal against the decision."
