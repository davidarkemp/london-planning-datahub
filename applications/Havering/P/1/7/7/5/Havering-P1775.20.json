    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "All new external finishes shall be carried out in materials to match those of the existing building(s) to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The door connecting the historic garage to the main dwelling shall be installed and maintained permanently and no cooking facilities shall be installed within this room. It shall not be occupied independently of the main dwelling and must always maintain a relationship with the main dwelling.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To ensure that the room is not self-contained or operated as a separate unit of accommodation, in the interests of the amenity of future occupants and to ensure compliance with Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent in writing. The revisions involved the removal of facilities from the room in the historic garage and the formation of a connecting doorway. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 25-01-2021.",
    "The applicant is advised that it is their responsibility to ensure that a change of use has not taken place and that the functioning of the premises as a HMO is lawful. Through the course of determining the application it has been suggested that there are seven persons within the dwelling which would represent a material change of use to a larger HMO for which permission would be required."
