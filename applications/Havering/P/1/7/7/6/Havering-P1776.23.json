    "The proposed development, by virtue of its use, level of proposed occupancy and overly intense operation of the application site would be at odds with the suburban nature of its surroundings, would result in undue harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers, and would adversely impact on the safety and convenience of the local highway network. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policies 6, 7, 24, and 34 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies H12, S1, S2, and T6 of the London Plan, and to the objectives of the NPPF.",
    "The proposed loft bedroom would not demonstrate a suitably high standard of accommodation for the intended occupant without a section plan, and would therefore be considered to have limited internal floor to ceiling height, contrary to Policies 6 and 7 of the  Havering Local Plan, Policies H12, S1 and S2 of the London Plan and the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
