    "The proposed part single, part two storey rear/side extension would, by reason of its excessive width, scale, bulk, mass and roof form at the rear at first floor level, appear as a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment that would be harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies 7 and 26 of the Havering Local Plan and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "The part single, part two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its depth, bulk, scale, mass and proximity to the common boundary, would be an intrusive and unneighbourly development and have an adverse effect on the amenity of adjacent occupiers at no. 29 Woodstock Avenue, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
