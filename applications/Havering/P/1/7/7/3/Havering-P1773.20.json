    "The formation of a two storey dwelling in this location and associated landscaping works would depart from the established pattern of development and would be detrimental to local character by reason of the prominent rear garden location, height, bulk and mass and would read as an overbearing and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden setting entirely out of keeping with the spacious and undeveloped character of the environment harmful to the appearance and character of the surrounding area and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The layout of the proposed development, including the narrowness of the plot, the proximity of the proposed dwellings to one another and neighbouring rear gardens would give rise to material harm to the amenity of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing impact and visual intrusion, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD.",
