    "As submitted the proposals would seek to remove 103 Daventry Road permanently from local housing stock for the purposes of short-term letting. The applicant has not demonstrated how this would align with the objectives of local and national planning policy. Fundamentally the proposals conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policy 3 which seeks to resist the loss of housing stock in the Borough.",
    "There is no evidence before officers that the proposed use would not attract comings and goings which would be distinguishable from its use as a single dwelling house and which might erode the residential character of the locality and sense of community. On that basis there would be conflict with Havering Local Plan Policies 3, 26 and 34, the London Plan Policy GG1 and the objectives of the Framework, specifically Para 135 which amongst other considerations seeks to ensure that development does not undermine community cohesion.",
    "In the absence of any evidence otherwise the proposed use has the potential to generate activity and disturbance through comings, goings, noise and vehicle movement distinguishable from other activities within Daventry Road to the detriment of neighbouring amenity and therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 16 and 34, London Plan S1 and the Framwork in particular Para 135 which amongst other considerations requires development provide a high standard of amenity.",
    "In the absence of evidence as to how the proposed use would operate it is unclear whether adequate parking provision can be made within the site or accommodated in surrounding roads without contributing to existing parking stress. It has not therefore been demonstrated that there would not be a material impact on the functioning of the highway or that the cumulative impacts would not be severe. The proposals are therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 23 and 24 which seek amongst other things to ensure adequate parking provision is made and that no unacceptable impacts on highway safety would occur. Further to this there would be conflict with Para 115 of the NPPF in the absence of any evidence otherwise.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 06-02-2024."
