    "The proposed development would, by reason of its close location to the rear boundary, its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, harmful to the character and appearance of the surround area and detrimental to the amenity of the adjoining occupiers in particular to No 10 Beaufort Close, resulting in an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD."
