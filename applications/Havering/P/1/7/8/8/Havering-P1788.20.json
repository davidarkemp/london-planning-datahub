  "description": "Construction of single storey outbuilding and swimming pool at rear garden",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Before any works commence a scheme for any new plant or machinery shall be submitted to the local planning authority to achieve the following standard. Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB and shall be maintained thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until samples of the external finishing materials, which shall match those of the existing building(s) are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter the development shall be constructed with the approved materials.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of the external finishing materials to be used.  Submission of samples prior to commencement will safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area and will ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policies DC54 and DC61.",
    "No works shall take place in relation to any of the development hereby approved until a scheme for the protection of tree adjacent to the proposed outbuilding on the site has been submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Such scheme shall contain details of the erection and maintenance of fences or walls around the trees, details of underground measures to protect roots, the control of areas around the trees and any other measures necessary for the protection of the trees. Such agreed measures shall be implemented before development commences and kept in place until the approved development is completed.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate how the preserved trees on site will be adequately protected during construction.  Submission of details prior to commencement will ensure that the measures to be employed are robust.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email. The revisions involved modification of siting of outbuilding and reduction in building size. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 24/2/21.",
    "You should also check whether the development requires separate Building Regulation consent. Information is available on the Building Control webpages and the team is available between 9am and 10am Monday to Friday via 01708 432700."
