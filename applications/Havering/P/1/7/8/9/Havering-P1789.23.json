    "The proposed linked detached double garage, by reason of its scale, bulk, mass, height and design would appear as an unacceptably dominant, incongruous and prominent feature within the street scene. For the same reasons as well as its proximity to the shared boundary with no. 48 Nelmes Way, it would also appear as a visually intrusive and unneighbourly form of development, thereby having an adverse effect on the amenity of these adjacent occupiers, contrary to Local Plan Policy 7 and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, it was necessary to issue a decision as close to the statutory timeframe as possible as opposed to seeking amendments which would have significantly delayed the application."
