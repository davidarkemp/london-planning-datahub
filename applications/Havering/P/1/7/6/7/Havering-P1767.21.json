    "The proposed development would fail to make provision for the minimum requirement of one three bedroom family unit required in conversions and subdivisions as set out within Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan 2016-2031.",
    "The original house had a gross internal floor space of approximately 95 square metres which does not meet the minimum standard of 120 square metres of original floor space. The proposal would result in the unacceptable loss of a family sized unit and therefore is contrary to section ii of Policy 9 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "The proposed development by reason of the resultant scale, bulk and mass of the host property and design concept of the extensions proposed cumulatively would appear dominant and visually intrusive to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area. Given the layout of the proposed floor plans, it is not considered that the proposal would be able to retain the distinctive 'A' frame appearance as indicated on the proposed Elevation Plan. This would exacerbate its visual prominence and exacerbating the harm identified thereby contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7 and 26 and the design guidance within the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to prevent future occupants from applying for or obtaining a residents parking permit, the proposal fails to satisfactorily mitigate the parking impacts of the development, contrary to the provisions of Policy 24 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031) and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed development would result in the unacceptable loss of a street tree, contrary to Policy 27 of the Local Plan (2016-2031).",
    "The proposed rear first floor balcony would, by reason of its position and proximity to neighbouring properties cause overlooking and loss of privacy which would have a serious and adverse effect on the living conditions of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy 26 of the Havering Local Plan (2016-2031). The proposal includes a first floor living area which would abut a bedroom of the attached dwelling, resulting in amenity impact through noise disturbance, contrary to Policy 9 of the Local Plan (2016-2031)",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of Â£9,500 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "The proposed extensions would be less than 100 square metres and therefore the Mayoral CIL is not applicable.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy Â£9,500 plus indexation for the application, based on the Havering's charging rate for residential of Â£125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 76 square"
