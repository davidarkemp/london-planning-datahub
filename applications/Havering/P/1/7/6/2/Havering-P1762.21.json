    "The site is within the area identified in the Havering Local Plan as Metropolitan Green Belt. Policy G2 of the London Plan and Government Guidance as set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the existing rural character of the area so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The development is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and it is considered that the very special circumstances that have been submitted in this case do not outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan, as well as the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would introduce urbanisation of this area of the Green Belt and an intensification of the existing business use, which would significantly harm openness and be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy G2 of the London Plan as well as the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of insufficient ecological information on European Protected Species (GCN & bats), Protected species (reptiles & badger), Priority species (Hedgehogs) and Priority habitats (hedgerow) and in the absence of landscape and tree assessments and  additional compensation, mitigation & biodiversity enhancement measures to make this proposal acceptable and result in the removal of existing trees, a hedgerow, landscaping and habitats, be materially harmful to ecology and the Green Belt and have an adverse impact on the settlement pattern and localised landscape structure contrary to Policies 27 and 30 of the Havering Local Plan, G2, G6 and G7 of the London Plan  as well as the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to MBH Design Studio via email on 10th February 2022."
