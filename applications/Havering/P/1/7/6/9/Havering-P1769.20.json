  "description": "Erection of 2 storey attached dwelling with associated parking and amenity space involving demolition of existing outbuilding and alterations to fenestration of existing house.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling would read as a dominant and visually intrusive piece of development. It would through its scale, bulk and mass and position forward of the building line of adjacent premises be at odds with the existing pattern of development and would erode the spacious character present through closing down the space between the flank elevation and back-edge of the foot-way, at odds with the spacious character of the street-scene. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the area and prevailing pattern of development contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD. There would also be conflict with paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which states that developments should function well, add to the overall quality of the area and be sympathetic to local character.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 15-02-21",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as well as Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the CIL payable would be:",
