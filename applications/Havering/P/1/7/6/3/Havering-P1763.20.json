    "The proposed development would, by reason of it's combined bulk, scale and design, appear out of character with the host dwelling as well as unbalancing the symmetry of the semi-detached pair and would be harmful to the streetscene, rear garden scene and surrounding area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2011 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "There is a small discrepancy in the plans. The site photos show that the existing rear extension has a 3 panel bi-fold door and another separate door to the rear, whereas the existing plans show only one door and a window.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal was given to Mr Vikrant Dahiya, via email on 18 February 2021."
