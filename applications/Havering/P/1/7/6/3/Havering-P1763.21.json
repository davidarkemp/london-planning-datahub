    "The proposed development, by reason of noise and disturbance caused increase in traffic entering and leaving the premises, vehicles parking and manoeuvring, particularly during the evening hours of operation, would be detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby residential properties, contrary to Havering Local Plan Policies 7, 26 and 34, and London Plan (2021) policies D14 and T6.",
    "The proposed development use would, by reason of its location and relationship to nearby sensitive receptors, in particular residential properties above and adjacent to the premises on Straight Road, result in an unsatisfactory relationship by way of noise and disturbance from the ventilation equipment associated with the use and potential odour from cooking smell which would be to the detriment of the amenity and living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Havering Local Plan Policy 34.",
    "The proposed extraction vent by reason of the location and design would result in an overbearing and unduly prominent feature in the street scene, visually intrusive and out of character with its surroundings and adjoining building, contrary to  Havering Local Plan Policy 26.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of the inadequate on site car parking provision, result in unacceptable overspill onto the adjoining roads to the detriment of highway safety and residential amenity. The proposed off-street parking arrangements without acceptable vehicular access would fail to safeguard the safety and comfort of pedestrians and cyclists and would be detrimental to traffic safety and increase road danger on Straight Road. The proposals would fail to provide sufficient room for turning on-site and be detrimental to the safe and efficient operation of buses on the busy junction contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan, London Plan policies T3, T4 and T7 and paragraph 104 of the NPPF (2021).",
