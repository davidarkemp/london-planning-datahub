    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",

    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",

    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any groundworks or development of the site, details shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out suitable has protection measures to be employed on site including, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable has resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015. The gas protection measures shall be carried out in strict accordance with the agreed details.",
    "Upon completion of installation, a 'Verification Report' must be submitted demonstrating that the works have been carried out.",

Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the risk arising from landfill gases.  Submission of an assessment prior to commencement will protect those redeveloping this site and any future occupants from potential landfill gas.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the agent via email. The revisions involved removing reference to the proposed change in roof height and adding a mono-pitched section to the side extension. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 16/02/2024."
