    "Prior to the commencement of the development hereby approved, details of all boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",

    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until cycle storage is provided in accordance with details previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The cycle storage shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to demonstrate what facilities will be available for cycle parking.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use is in the interests of providing a wide range of facilities for non-motor car residents and sustainability.",
    "Before the building(s) hereby permitted is first occupied, details of parking arrangement including permeable surfacing materials shall be provided and approved in writing by the local planning authority, there after the forecourt shall be surfaced in accordance to the approved scheme and retained permanently thereafter for the accommodation of vehicles in association with the future occupiers of the dwellings.",

    "The building(s) shall be so constructed as to provide sound insulation of 43 DnT,w + Ctr dB (minimum values) against airborne noise and 64 L \"nT,w dB (maximum values) against impact noise to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining properties.",
    "No building shall be occupied or use commenced until refuse and recycling facilities are provided in accordance with details which shall previously have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The refuse and recycling facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge how refuse and recycling will be managed on site.  Submission of this detail prior to occupation in the case of new building works or prior to the use commencing in the case of changes of use will protect the amenity of occupiers of the development and also the locality generally and ensure that the development accords with the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document Policy DC61.",
    "A fee is required when submitting details pursuant to the discharge of conditions.  In order to comply with the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012, (as amended), a fee of £116 per request or £34 where the related permission was for extending or altering a dwellinghouse, is needed.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018.",
    "Before occupation of the residential/ commercial unit(s) hereby approved, it is a requirement to have the property/properties officially Street Named and Numbered by our Street Naming and Numbering Team.  Official Street Naming and Numbering will ensure that that Council has record of the property/properties so that future occupants can access our services.

    "you are also advised to take the following (DOCOs) recommendations for security purposes;",
    "Main Communal Entrance - Given the local crime activities and the intended residency we recommend that the front door set (and the adjoining fixed window), meet a minimum standard of PAS 24:2016 and access should be controlled as specified below.",
    "Access Control - Due to the high likelihood of residents not returning keys or getting additional keys cut for future unlawful use, we recommend the instillation of an electronic release audio access control system at the communal entrances.
