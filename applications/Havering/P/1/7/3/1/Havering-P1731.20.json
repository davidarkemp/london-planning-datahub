    "The proposed development by reason of its roof design, excessive width, incongruous layout, scale, bulk, mass and materiality would appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and rear garden harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension would, by reason of its excessive height and position close to the boundaries of the site, be an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document and the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary.",
