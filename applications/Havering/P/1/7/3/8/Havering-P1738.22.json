    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its combined height, bulk, mass and position close to the boundaries of the site is considered to be an unneighbourly development which is out of scale with its surroundings and creates a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the rear garden environment, that is harmful to the amenity of adjacent occupiers, in particular No. 12 Adelphi Crescent contrary to the  Supplementary Planning Document for Residential Extensions and Alteration SPD and Policy 7 of the Local Plan.",
