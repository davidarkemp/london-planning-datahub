    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed within the application form and set out in supporting documentation unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The proposed extension hereby permitted shall be heated using ASHP as indicated in writing 30-01-2024 unless otherwise agreed in writing with the LPA.",
    "Reason:  In the interests of air quality and in order to comply with London Plan Policy SI 1 and relevant guidance, as subsequently amended.",
    "The proposal is liable for the Mayor of London Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). The Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering is £25/m² and is chargeable for each additional square metre of residential gross internal [floor] (GIA).  Based upon the information supplied with the application, £8,450  would be payable due to result in a new floor area of approx 338² of GIA, however this may be adjusted subject to indexation.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website. You are also advised to visit the planning portal website where you can download the appropriate document templates at http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applicatio"
