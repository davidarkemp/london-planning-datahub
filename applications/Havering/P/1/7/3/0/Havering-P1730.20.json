    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under Drawing no: PL-17, dated November 2020, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area and comply with Policy DC61 of the Development Control Policies Development Plan Document.",

    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used only for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house at 11 Sylvan Avenue, Hornchurch, and not for any trade or business nor as living accommodation.",

The scheme should demonstrate compliance with the following noise standard - Noise levels expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level LAeq (1 hour) when calculated at the boundary with the nearest noise sensitive premises shall not exceed LA90 -10dB. The noise/vibration control measures outlined in the scheme shall be implemented and maintained thereafter.",
    "Reason:  To prevent noise nuisance to adjoining/adjacent properties.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: No significant problems were identified during the consideration of the application, and therefore it has been determined in accordance with paragraphs 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019."
