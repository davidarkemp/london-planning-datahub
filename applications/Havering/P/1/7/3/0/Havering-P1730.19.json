    "The site is within the area identified in the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document as Metropolitan Green Belt.  The proposed development would, by reason of its scale, bulk and mass, taking into account the existing additions and historic development at the site by way of the cumulative impact would result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building and therefore, would be inappropriate in principle within the Green Belt. No special circumstances have been submitted in this case and the proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CP14 and DC45 of the adopted LDF Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan 2016 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its combined design, bulk and mass, appear as an incongruous and visually intrusive development harmful to the character of the subject property and therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the guidance contained within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD. Furthermore the development would neither preserve nor enhance the special character of this part of the Conservation Area. The development sought is therefore contrary to Policy DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document in addition to the Heritage SPD and National Planning Policy Framework.",
