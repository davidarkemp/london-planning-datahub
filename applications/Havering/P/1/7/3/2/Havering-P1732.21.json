    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on drawing PROPOSED PLANS AND ELEVATIONS revised on 09th December 2021 accompanying the application, the single storey office outbuilding hereby approved shall be finished in Cedral lap cladding white prior to it first being brought into use unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  It shall then be retained as such permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To safeguard the appearance of the premises and the character of the immediate area, and in order that the development accords with the Local Plan.",
    "The construction of the outbuilding hereby approved shall be carried out solely in accordance with the details of the screw piling as shown on the Ground Screw Plan received on 18-01-22 and in relation to the submitted Adaptor Screw Product sheet which contains details of the underground measures to protect the root of the trees adjacent to the proposal.",
    "Reason:-  To protect the adjacent trees.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "The single storey office building hereby permitted shall be used  for purposes incidental to the primary use of the site as a care home and not for any other use nor for the provsiion of residential accommodation at any time.",
    "Reason:-",
    "The proposal is acceptable for the stated purpose but alternative uses of the office building may give rise to additional impacts which would need to be the subject of further assessment and therefore should be controlled.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with Mr Besant (Agent) by phone and e-mail. The revisions involved clearly indicating the retention of the trees and boundary wall but also the materials to be used on the proposed office building. The amendments were subsequently submitted on 30-11-21, 09-12-21 & 18-01-22."
