The proposal is also liable for Mayoral CIL and will incur a charge of £5,550. (subject to indexation) based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre.",
    "These charges are levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008.  CIL is payable within 60 days of commencement of development. A Liability Notice will be sent to the applicant (or anyone else who has assumed liability) shortly and you are required to notify the Council of the commencement of the development before works begin.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: In accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, improvements required to make the proposal acceptable were negotiated with the Agent by email on the 11/07/22.
