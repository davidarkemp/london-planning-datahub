    "The proposed development, by reason of the substandard provision of accommodation with particular reference to the cramped internal layout with insufficient internal floorspace, inadequate light to and poor outlook from habitable room windows would create an unacceptable living environment which would be detrimental to the amenity of the future occupiers and the character of the surrounding area contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan, Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Adopted London Borough of Havering SPD on Residential Design 2010. The proposal would be contrary to the implementation of the DCLG Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard March 2015.",
