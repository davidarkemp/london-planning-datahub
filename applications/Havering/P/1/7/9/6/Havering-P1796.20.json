  "description": "Erection of a two storey building to include 4 x self contained flats (2x two-bedroom flats and 2x one-bedroom flats) with associated parking and amenity space.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The bulk, scale and mass of the proposed development in close proximity to the boundaries would appear as an unneighbourly cramped overdevelopment of the site, incongruous with the local pattern of development and out of character with the surrounding built form, therefore harmful to local character and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to London Plan Policy 7.4 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposal fails to meet the minimum internal floor space standard, would have inadequate outlook from rear ground floor habitable rooms and provide insufficient private outdoor amenity space for the top floor flats, resulting in substandard residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future occupiers, contrary to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed development would by reason of its excessive bulk, mass and scale on a constrained site within close proximity of the boundaries result in an visually intrusive form of development that would compromise the amenity of neighbouring properties by way of harm to outlook, sense of enclosure, loss of privacy and overbearing impact contrary to the objectives of DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to agent via email on 26/2/21.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £6100 and £30,500 for Havering CIL, subject to indexation. Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
