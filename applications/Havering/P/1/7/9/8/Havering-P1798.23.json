    "Unit 02 has a double bedroom, which is capable of double occupancy, and therefore, it fails to meet the minimum gross internal floor area of 50 square metres for a one bedroom, two person, one storey dwelling. In addition, the only window to the bedroom would be a very short distance to a two storey flank wall providing poor aspect and outlook from this habitable room, both of which would result in substandard residential accommodation detrimental to the amenity of the future residents contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and Policy D6 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed layout of the development would be inadequate resulting in substandard accommodation for future residents. The access arrangements for Unit 01 would result in a loss of amenity, including overlooking and loss of privacy, to the habitable room windows of Unit 02 harmful to the amenity of future occupiers of Unit 02 contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The lack of amenity space for the proposed flats would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy D6 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its excessive depth, height, scale, bulk, mass and siting, be unneighbourly, appear dominant, visually intrusive and overbearing in the rear garden environment and result in a significant loss of amenity to adjacent occupiers, particularly No. 163A High Street, contrary to Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan, the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Stephensons via email on 14th May 2024.",
    "The proposal, if granted planning permission on appeal, would be liable for the Mayor of London and Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). Based upon the information supplied with the application, the Mayoral CIL payable would be £1,000 based on the calculation of £25.00 per square metre and the Havering Community Infrastructure Levy (HCIL) would be a charge of £5,000 based on calculation of £125 per square metre. Each would be subject to indexation.",
    "Further details with regard to CIL are available from the Council's website."
