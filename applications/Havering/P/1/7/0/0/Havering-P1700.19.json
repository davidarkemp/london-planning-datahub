  "description": "erection of two new dwelling houses to rear of 172-174 Collier row lane",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwellings given the constraints of the site would appear as a cramped  form of development within the rear garden environment, entirely out of character with the surrounding environment and established pattern of development therefore harmful to visual amenity of the area and detrimental to neighbouring residential amenity, contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6.",
    "The proposed development whilst it would meet overall minimum floorspace standards, individual habitable rooms would be overly constrained, in particular, within the roof space providing sub-standard residential accommodation for future occupiers. Contrary to the aims of London Plan Policy 3.5 and Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the parking arrangements and access would be practical for future occupiers of the development to manoeuvre and enter/exit in forward gear as  well as to achieve a high quality and safe arrangement for non-car mode users through intensification of the shared space. Through the travel distance and uncertainty over the practicality of the parking, waste and servicing arrangements the resultant environment for future occupants of the development and adjacent accommodation would potentially be harmed. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policies DC33, DC36 and DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Amendments were sought by staff which addressed issues with parking, however it was not considered that the above reasons for refusal were capable of being overcome. Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason for it were given to the agent in writing 05-06-2020",
    "Please note also that should permission be granted, from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £25,500 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development. Based upon calculations undertaken by the case officer and information supplied with the application your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £4,250 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 1",
    "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures implemented, a site visit was not undertaken by the case officer. For the purposes of assessing the proposed development a combination of historic photographs, including those from the previous submission, street-view, relevant aerial photography and historic records including drawings were utilised."
