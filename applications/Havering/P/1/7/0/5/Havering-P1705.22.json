    "In the absence of marketing evidence to clearly demonstrate that the existing public house is not viable, the proposal would result in the loss of a public house and a community facility contrary to Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies HC7 and S1 of the London Plan.",
    "The creation and siting of three car parking spaces, together with space to manoeuvre vehicles to enter and exit the site, would substantially reduce the amount of land for The Angel Inn, including reducing the size of the pub garden and affecting its car parking provision, which would have a detrimental impact on the functionality and viability of The Angel Inn public house as a community facility contrary to Policy 16 of the Havering Local Plan, Policies HC7 and S1 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The cumulative impact of the creation and siting of three car parking spaces, with a loss of soft landscaping and an increase in hardstanding on the site, would be harmful to the setting of this locally listed building and a Grade II listed building and the character and appearance of the Rainham Conservation Area contrary to Policies 27 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan, Policy HC1 of the London Plan and the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "There are three car parking spaces for the proposed office use, which exceeds the maximum car parking provision of up to one space contrary to the aim of the Mayor to reduce car use. In the absence of a swept path analysis/tracking plans, the creation and siting of the parking spaces would result in a cramped layout with inadequate access and egress arrangements harmful to highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policies 23 and 24 of the Havering Local Plan and Policies T4 and T6.2 of the London Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to Design Ghar Limited via email on 21st December 2022."
