    "The proposal, by reason of the volume, bulk and footprint of the extensions, would result in disproportionate additions to the original house and garage over and above their original form and would result in material harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt.  No very special circumstances to justify such harm have been submitted. The size, design and scale of the extensions would also appear overbearing and visually intrusive within the plot and in relation to the host property, detrimental to the character of the Cranham Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore considered to be be contrary to the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy G2 of the London Plan and Policies 26 and 28 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent by e-mail on 03/04/2024."
