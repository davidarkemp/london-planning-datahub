  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development to which this permission relates must be commenced not later than three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To comply with the requirements of Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).",
    "The proposed development hereby approved shall be constructed in accordance with the materials detailed under the Materials section of the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the proposed development will harmonise with the character of the surrounding area.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be carried out otherwise than in complete accordance with the approved plans (as set out on page one of this decision notice).",
    "Reason:-",
    "For the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that the development is carried out as approved.",
    "All building operations in connection with the construction of external walls, roof, and foundations; site excavation or other external site works; works involving the use of plant or machinery; the erection of scaffolding; the delivery of materials; the removal of materials and spoil from the site, and the playing of amplified music shall only take place between the hours of 8.00am and 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and between 8.00am and 1.00pm on Saturdays and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays/Public Holidays.",
    "Reason:-",
    "To protect residential amenity.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on the approved plans, including Drawing No.'s 1B and 6D, a 1.8m high close boarded fence shall be provided on the north western (rear) and north eastern (side) boundaries of the private amenity area of No. 82 Como Street with a gate. The fencing shall be permanently retained and maintained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To protect the visual amenities of the development and prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property.",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on the approved plans, including Drawing No.'s 1B and 6D, prior to any above ground works details of all proposed walls, fences and boundary treatment shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority.  The boundary development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details before the development is first occupied and retained permanently thereafter to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:",
    "Insufficient information has been supplied with the application to judge the appropriateness of any boundary treatment.  Submission of this detail prior to above ground works will protect the visual amenities of the development, prevent undue overlooking of adjoining property and ensure that the development accords with Policy 7 of the Havering Local Plan.",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the dwellings hereby approved, a scheme of hard and soft landscaping shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.
