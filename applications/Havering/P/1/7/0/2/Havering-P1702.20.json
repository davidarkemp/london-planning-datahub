    "The proposal building would by reason of its bulk, scale, layout and potential for independent use form an incongruous feature at the rear of the garden.  It would be contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD and the advice given in the NPPF which states that new development should conserve and enhance local character and respect the surrounding built environment, respond to local character and add to the overall qualities of an area and the guidance contained within the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
