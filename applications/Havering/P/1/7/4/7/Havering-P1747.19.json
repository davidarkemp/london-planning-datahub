  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its unsympathetic design, massing and detailing, result in unacceptable harm to the intrinsic character of the host property. This would neither preserve nor enhance the special character of this part of the Gidea Park Conservation Area, and the identified harm would not be outweighed by any public benefits. The proposed development is therefore contrary to paragraph 196 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policies 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (MALP 2016), policies DC61 and DC68 of the Core Strategy and Development Control Policies Development Plan Document, the Heritage SPD and section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 [as amended].",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of its height, bulk and mass, appear as an unacceptably dominant and visually intrusive feature in the adjacent garden scene and harmful to the appearance of the surrounding area contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent via e-mail prior to the decision notice being issued."
