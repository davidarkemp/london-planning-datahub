    "The proposed development would be contrary to the general pattern of the development which primarily is characterised by row of houses to the front with generous landscaped gardens to the rear. The proposal would squeeze a new dwelling at the far end of the garden, with poor access, taking up a significant portion of landscaped gardens, with loss of two existing ancillary outbuildings and is sited within proximity of the boundaries with two neighbours. The proposed development due to its siting, scale, height, width and depth,  would fail to be in keeping with the character of the area.  The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies 7, 10, 26 and 27 of the Local Plan and Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021. Taken together, these policies and guidance seek to ensure that development is of a high quality design and respects the distinctive qualities, identity, and character of the area and seeks to ensure the development on garden and backland sites does not adversely harm th",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, mass, bulk and position would appear as prominent and over bearing when viewed from the garden of the host dwellings as well as those of the adjoining occupiers. The proposed development therefore conflicts with Policies Policy 10 and policy 7 of the Local Plan and Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and NPPF 23. Taken together, these policies and guidance seek to ensure that development would not adversely affect the amenities of the neighbouring occupies.",
    "The proposed development would, by reason of poor outlook and unsatisfactory access to the residential unit give rise to a poor quality of accommodation for the future occupiers of the site contrary to Local Plan Policies 7, 10 and 27 and  policy D6 of London Plan 2021 and advice given in the NPPF.",
