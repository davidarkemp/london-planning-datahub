  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwelling would, by reason of its siting and design, appear out of keeping with the spacious character that exists within the street-scene and would present as a cramped form of development  and is therefore contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "The proposed dwelling by reason of its positioning on the site and proximity to shared boundaries, in conjunction with its scale, bulk and mass would represent an intrusive and unneighbourly development as well as having an adverse effect on the amenities of adjacent occupiers contrary to Policy DC61 of the LDF Core Strategy and Development Control Policies DPD.",
    "Please note also that should permission were to be granted, (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £33,750 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development. Based upon calculations undertaken by the case officer and information supplied with the application your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £5625 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A) and the floorspace of 225 square metres",
