    "The proposed development, in  particular the first floor rear extension by reason of its design, excessive width and bulk and position close to the boundary with No.78 Elm Park Avenue, would be a dominant and visually intrusive addition, overwhelming the rear elevation and resulting in an intrusive development that is harmful to the amenity of the adjoining occupier at no.78 Elm Park Avenue, having an adverse effect on the visual amenities and character of the area, contrary to the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document, policies D1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021) and Policies 7 and 26 of the Local Plan.",
