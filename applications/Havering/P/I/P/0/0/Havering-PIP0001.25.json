    "The Council is not persuaded that the amount of development proposed, a mix of six to eight two bedroom three person and three bedroom four person dwellings can be accommodated on this site and that the quantum of development is appropriate. The amount of development proposed and as described would dictate the massing of the development and amount and extent of site coverage which would likely be consistent with earlier decisions made for the site (REFS: P1864.23 / P0952.24). This would lead to impacts with local character, site layout in the context of prevailing patterns of development, residential environment for future occupants and neighbouring amenity. The Council has given consideration to both the lower amount and maximum amount stated in reaching this position and regards there to be conflict with Havering Local Plan 2016-2031 Policies 7, 10, 26 and 34, the London Plan and National Planning Policy Framework (Paras 131-139).",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the agent in writing 03-03-2025"
