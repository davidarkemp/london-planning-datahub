    "The site is within the area identified in the Local Development Framework as Metropolitan Green Belt. The National Planning Policy Framework (Green Belts) states that in order to achieve the purposes of the Metropolitan Green Belt it is essential to retain and protect the openness of the so allocated and that new development will only be permitted outside the existing built up areas in the most exceptional circumstances. The development is inappropriate in principle in the Green Belt and it is considered that the very special circumstances that have been submitted in this case do not outweigh the harm caused by reason of inappropriateness and visual harm to the character and openness of the Green Belt. The proposed development would there be contrary to the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal by reason introduction new housing with a significant physical presence  would amount to a substantial suburban incursion into the Green Belt. The residential nature of the proposals including its associated curtilages, would create a formalised domestic layout with gardens to the side and rear and a parking area. The proposals would introduce an urban layout and character which would significantly harm openness and would be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The provision of housing in principle would undermine further the continued restoration of the land following recent removal of habitat including trees and would  have significant impact upon the ecological and biodiversity value of the site. In this respect the proposal would be contrary to policies 27 and 30 of the Local Plan, the host of policies in Chapter 8 of London Plan and the advice given in the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "Statement Required by Article 35 (2) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015: Consideration was given to seeking amendments, but given conflict with adopted planning policy, notification of intended refusal and the reason(s) for it was given to the applicant on 11.03.2022"
