    "It is considered that the proposal falls outside of the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 14, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as the installation of the solar panels would be contrary to condition No.7 of P1221.18 which withdraw permitted development rights including additions to roofs, which the installation of the solar panels will be. As a result, it is considered that the solar panels to be retained are not permitted development and require a planning application."
