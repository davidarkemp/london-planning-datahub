    "Insufficient qualitative evidence has been provided to demonstrate that the premises has been used and occupied without any fatal breaks for the requisite four year period. The absence of meaningful periods of utility bills specifically for the annexe which correspond with occupation and/or a statutory declaration by the occupiers/owners weighs against the applicant's version of events and prevents the Council from forming a favourable view.",
