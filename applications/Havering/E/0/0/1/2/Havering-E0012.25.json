    "The operations do not fall within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. The gabled wall has been built up to include the cheek of the dormer.  The resultant dormer, being entirely rendered as part of the gabled wall, means that the cheek of the dormer is not finished in materials which match those used in the main roof of the house, which is tiled. As such, the existing roof alteration does not comply with part B.2 (a) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) and therefore requires planning permission.",
    "The drawings submitted with this application do not appear to accurately reflect the development as carried out on site.  In the absence of accurate drawings, the Local Planning Authority cannot be certain that the development as undertaken complies with the relevant provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended, with particular reference to the resultant volume."
