    "Upon review of evidence available to the Local Planning Authority, it is clear that enforcement action could have been taken against the operations applied for (consisting of the use of the car parking spaces at units B12, B13 and B14 for the siting of a container and a freezer, and the erection of a means of enclosure (boundary fence)) at the time of the application.
