    "On the balance of probabilities, the Local Planning Authority refuse a Certificate of Lawfulness for the use of the outbuilding to the rear of 53 Ernest Road as a separate unit of accommodation, as the development is not deemed lawful within the meaning of Section 191(2) (a) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended. Further, insufficient qualitative and quantitative evidence has been provided in support of the application, and the level of representation made by neighbouring residents which is noted to conflict with the applicant's version of events and the lack of substantive evidence is considered to weigh against the proposals."
