    "The building works, including the rear dormer window and loft conversion, were not substantially completed more than four years before the date of this application. In addition, permitted development rights have been removed for extensions or enlargements to the dwelling under the original planning consent for the dwelling house for planning application L/HAV/1667/81 (condition No.4). As a result, the retention of the existing rear dormer window and loft conversion are not permitted development.",
    "It is noted that planning application P1601.22 for a single storey side/rear and rear dormer extension and conversion of attached garage to habitable use including alterations to front elevation (Retrospective) was refused and the rear dormer was dismissed on appeal (reference APP/B5480/D/23/3314219). This matter has been referred to the Council's enforcement team."
