    "The hardstanding is not in accordance with the requirements of the enforcement notice dated 28 July 2004 (upheld on appeal on 21 November 2005). Specifically the enforcement notice requires the land, including the current area of hardstanding, to be regraded to levels approved by planning permission reference P0941.00 and shown in drawing 3004/C01/150802/M9a. The grading of the hardstanding does not match the approved plan. The enforcement notice is still \"in force\" and no contrary evidence has been provided to indicate otherwise. Section 191(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 which states that a use or operation is not lawful where there is an enforcement notice and as such an lawful development certificate cannot be issued."
