    "Buildings A, B and C are in contravention of an enforcement notice dated 4th October 1988, which required the cessation of the use of the building for unauthorised offices and storage purposes and their reversion back to agricultural use.  The council records indicate that enforcement notice is still \"in force\" and no contrary evidence has been provided to indicate otherwise.",
    "Insufficient qualitative and quantitative evidence has been provided in support of the application and the lack of substantive evidence is considered to weigh against the proposals with respect to buildings D and E to establish their uses for storage purposes within Class B8 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, as amended, for a period over ten years.",
    "There is no evidence to demonstrate that the grassland identified with the application site has been used in connection with the activities associated with the cluster of buildings being used for business uses.",
    "The land to the southeast of the building has had its land levels raised by using imported building materials and rubble. In addition, two enclosures have been created using palisade fencing and the enclosed land is used for car sales. The operation and the uses are unauthorised and have commenced less than four years ago."
