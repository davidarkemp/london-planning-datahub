    "It is considered that the proposed development would not be lawful within the meaning of section 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act as it would not comply with the requirement of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order  2015 (as amended) and therefore would not constitute permitted development because it has not been demonstrated that the outbuilding by reason of its size and use would be reasonably required for incidentals purposes to the enjoyment of the dwelling house.",
    "For Residential Development Only",
    "Please be advised that approval of this application from 1st September 2019 (either by London Borough of Havering, or subsequently by PINS if allowed on appeal following a refusal by London Borough of Havering) will attract a liability payment of £2,550 plus indexation in Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This charge has been levied under s.206 of the Planning Act 2008 and includes both the Mayor of London's CIL and Havering Council's CIL.",
    "London Borough of Havering, as CIL collecting authority, has responsibility for the collection of the Mayoral CIL, in addition to Havering's CIL, on commencement of the development.",
    "Your proposal is subject to a CIL Liability Notice indicating a levy of £22,800 plus indexation for the application, based on the Mayoral CIL levy rate for Havering of £25/sq.m plus Havering's charging rate for residential of £125/sq.m (Zone A), and the floorspace of 152 square metres.",
