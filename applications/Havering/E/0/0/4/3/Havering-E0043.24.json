    "It is considered that there is insufficient and conflicting information provided to be able to conclude that the use of the caravan would be ancillary to the main dwelling and would not form a separate household. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm that the proposal does not represent a material change of use of the land to a separate residential unit."
