    "The Council consider that the proposed development by reason of its depth, height and position on the shared boundary, would unacceptably harm the amenity of adjacent neighbour at No. 7 Ambleside Avenue, Hornchurch, by reason of loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and overbearing effect on this property.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
