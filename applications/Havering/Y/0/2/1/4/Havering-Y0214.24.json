    "The Council consider that the proposed development would not comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015. Specifically:",
    "1. The proposed development, when joined to the existing detached garage within the site, would extend beyond the rear wall of the original semi-detached dwellinghouse by more than 6 metres",
    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of the neighbouring dwelling at no. 5 Manser Road would be unacceptable by reason of its excessive depth and proximity to the boundaries of the site and would therefore result in overshadowing, loss of light, an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure, all of which would be detrimental to the amenity of these neighbouring occupiers."
