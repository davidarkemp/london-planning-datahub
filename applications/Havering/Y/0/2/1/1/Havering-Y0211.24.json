    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development would unacceptably harm the amenity of  the adjacent neighbours at No.24 Byron Way, Romford by reason of loss of light, outlook and overbearing effect on this property.",
    "The proposal would not be Permitted Development as the eaves height of the proposed extension would be higher than the 3m permissible under permitted development and therefore the proposal does not comply with Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
    "The applicant has the right to an appeal against this notice to the Planning Inspectorate, see details below.",
    "Preparation for any re-submission Informative",
    "The applicant should note that the eaves height is measured from the ground level at the base of the outside wall to the point where that wall would meet the upper surface of the flat roof - the overhang and the parapet wall should be ignored for the purposes of measurement as outlined within MHCLG Permitted development rights for householders Technical Guidance (September 2019) but should be included within the overall height. As such, the eaves should not be measured to the underneath of the gutter line but to the top of flat roof as per the guidance and as a result, the eaves and overall height on the application form should state 3m."
