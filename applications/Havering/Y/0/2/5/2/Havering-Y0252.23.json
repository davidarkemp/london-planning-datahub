    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development would unacceptably harm the amenity of the adjacent neighbours by reason of loss of light, outlook and overbearing effect on this property.",
    "The proposal is not permitted development due to the proposed single storey rear extension(prior approval) being more than half the width of the original dwelling (where there is a staggered original rear wall or where the proposal extends beyond the rear wall) due to the fact the existing characteristic pitched roof projection was demolished to make way for the existing ground floor rear extension on site, case law advises that the 'original' rear wall is the element to be taken into consideration.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
