    "The Council consider that the proposed development would not comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015. Specifically:",
    "1. The proposed development, when joined to the existing store, would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse.",
    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of the neighbouring dwelling at no. 59 Frederick Road would be unacceptable by reason of its excessive depth and proximity to the boundaries of the site and would therefore result in overshadowing, an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure, all of which would be detrimental to the amenity of these neighbouring occupiers."
