    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development, by reason of its depth, height and position on the boundary would be intrusive and unneighbourly that would have an overbearing impact and significant loss of outlook to the amenity of adjacent occupiers at No. 23 Felstead Road, Romford",
    "The application site has previously developed a single storey rear extension with a pitch roof over 4m high. The proposal is therefore not permitted development as the height of the enlarged part would exceeds 4m and also the eaves of the proposed extension would exceed the height of the eaves of the existing dwelling house and is therefore not permitted development.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
    "The applicant has the right to an appeal against this notice to the Planning Inspectorate, see details below.",
    "Raised patio informative",
    "The applicant should note that the photos provided to assess this application shows a drop in ground level within the rear of the site with three steps going from the dwelling into the garden. As such, the raised patio shown on proposed drawing in officer's opinion would be more than 30cm."
