    "The Council consider that the proposed development would not comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015. Specifically the nominal distance between the proposed extension and existing garage is not considered to constitute a 'meaningful gap' between the two structures thereby meaning that both cumulatively would appear and be perceived as one development joined to each other that projects beyond the rear of the original dwelling by six metres.",
    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of the neighbouring dwelling at no. 5 Manser Road would be unacceptable by reason of its excessive depth and proximity to the boundaries of the site and would therefore result in overshadowing, loss of light, an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure, all of which would be detrimental to the amenity of these neighbouring occupiers."
