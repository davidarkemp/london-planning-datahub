    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of the adjoining dwelling at 33 Waverley Road would be unacceptable by reason of the depth of the extension and its proximity to the shared boundary, resulting in overshadowing, loss of light, an overbearing impact and increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of the adjoining occupiers.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
