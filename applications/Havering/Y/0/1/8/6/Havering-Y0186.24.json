    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of the neighbouing dwellings at nos. 17 and 21 Elmer Gardens would be unacceptable by reason of its depth and would therefore result in overshadowing, loss of light, an overbearing impact and an increased sense of enclosure, all of which would be detrimental to the amenity of these neighbouring occupiers.",
    "The proposed development would not comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015. Specifically, the height of the eaves of the part of the dwellinghouse enlarged, improved or altered would exceed the height of the eaves of the existing dwellinghouse. As such, the application fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs A.1 (d) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
