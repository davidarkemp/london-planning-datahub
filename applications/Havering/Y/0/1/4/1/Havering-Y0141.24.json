    "The proposed single storey rear extension due to its excessive depth and proximity to the shared boundaries with No's 68 and 72 Ingrebourne Road, would contribute to an overbearing sense of enclosure, a significant loss of outlook from the existing rear windows at the ground floor while reducing the availability of natural sunlight into the rear of both neighbouring dwellings. It is deemed to be detrimental to the ongoing residential amenity of both No's 68 and 72 Ingrebourne Road contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
