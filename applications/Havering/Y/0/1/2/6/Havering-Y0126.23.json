    "The proposed single storey rear extension due to its excessive depth and mass to the shared boundaries with No's 33 and 37 Macdonald Avenue, would result in an overbearing form of development, cause a significant loss of outlook, an increased sense of enclosure and would reduce the availability of natural sunlight into the rear of both neighbours' dwellings to the detriment of the amenity of both sets of neighbouring occupants.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
