    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development, by reason of its depth, would be intrusive and unneighbourly and have an adverse effect on the amenity of adjacent occupiers at Nos. 19 and 23 Felstead Road.",
    "The application site has previously developed a single storey rear extension with a pitch roof over 4m high. The Proposal is therefore not permitted development as the height exceeds 4m and the depth of the proposed extension is more than 8m for a detached property.",
    "The eaves height of the proposed extension would appear to be higher than the eaves of the existing dwelling house.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
