    "The raised patio as shown in the submitted plans did not form part of the consideration of the application.",
    "Any extension to the existing patio would require planning permission being more than 30mm in height.",

It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
