    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development, by reason of its depth and proximity to the boundary of the site,  would unacceptably harm the amenity of  the adjacent neighbours at No.55 Birch Close, Romford by reason of loss of light, outlook and overbearing effect on this property.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
