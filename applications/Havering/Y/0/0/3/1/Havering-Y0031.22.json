    "Proposal is not permitted development due to the proposed extension being more than half the width of the original dwelling (where there is a staggered original rear wall or where the proposal extends beyond the rear wall).  Even with the intent to demolish the furthest forward rear wall (bay window), case law advises that the 'original' rear wall is the element to be taken into consideration at the time of validation.",
