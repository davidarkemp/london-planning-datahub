    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development, by reason of its depth and proximity to the boundary of the site, would unacceptably harm the amenity of the adjoining neighbour at No.33 Bush Elms Road, Hornchurch by reason of loss of outlook and overbearing effect on this property.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.
