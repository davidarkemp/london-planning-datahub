    "Land Contamination Informative",
    "The applicant should note that the application site falls within a contaminated land area. Prior to the commencement of any groundworks or development of the site, the applicant should liaise with the Building Control Department setting out suitable gas protection measures to be employed on site including, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable gas resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015.

The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
