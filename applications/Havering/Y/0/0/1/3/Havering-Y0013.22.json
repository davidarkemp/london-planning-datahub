  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey rear extension due to its excessive depth and height on the shared boundaries with No.120 and 124 Barnstaple Road, would result in an overbearing impact and a significant loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of the occupiers.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
