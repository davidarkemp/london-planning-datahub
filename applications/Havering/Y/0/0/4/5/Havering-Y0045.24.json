    "The proposed single storey rear extension due to its excessive depth and proximity to the shared boundaries with No's 46 and 52 Claremont Road, would contribute to an overbearing sense of enclosure, a significant loss of outlook from the existing rear window while reducing the availability of natural sunlight into the rear of both neighbouring dwellings. It is deemed to be detrimental to the ongoing residential amenity of both No's 46 and 52 Claremont Road contrary to Policy 7 of the Local Plan and the Council's Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
