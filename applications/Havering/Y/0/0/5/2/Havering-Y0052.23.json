    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development would unacceptably harm the amenity of  the adjacent neighbours at No.140 Suttons Avenue, Hornchurch by reason of loss of light, outlook and overbearing effect on this property.",
    "Proposal is not permitted development due to the proposed extension being more than half the width of the original dwelling (where there is a staggered original rear wall or where the proposal extends beyond the rear wall).  Even with the intent to demolish the furthest forward rear wall (bay window), case law advises that the 'original' rear wall is the element to be taken into consideration at the time of validation.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
    "The applicant has the right to an appeal against this notice to the Planning Inspectorate, see details below."
