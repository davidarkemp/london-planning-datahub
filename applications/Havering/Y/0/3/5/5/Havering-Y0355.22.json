    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no window or other opening (other than those shown on the submitted and approved plan,) shall be formed in the flank wall(s) of the building(s) hereby permitted, unless specific permission under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 has first been sought and obtained in writing from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In order to ensure a satisfactory development that will not result in any loss of privacy or damage to the environment of neighbouring properties which exist or may be proposed in the future.",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific permission from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:-",
    "In the interests of the amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring dwelling.",
    "Land Ownership Informative",
    "The applicant is advised that this planning permission does not give consent for any part of the development including guttering and fascias to encroach onto any land not within the applicant's ownership.",
    "Land Contamination Informative",
    "The applicant should note that the application site falls within a contaminated land area. Prior to the commencement of any groundworks or development of the site, the applicant should liaise with the Building Control Department setting out suitable gas protection measures to be employed on site including, but not necessarily limited to, the installation of a suitable gas resistant membrane, in compliance with BS 8485:2015.  The gas protection measures should be provided to protect the occupiers of the dwelling house from methane and carbon dioxide.",
    "Implementation of the Proposal",
    "Works under permitted development, for example, the single storey rear extension (Y0355.22) need to be substantially complete prior to undertaking any other works. Therefore the single storey rear extension would need to be water tight and substantially complete. Substantially complete would mean, roof constructed, window or doors installed and a first coat finish applied.  Where works are not substantially completed and are being done in conjunction with a planning application that are under consideration such as P1843.22, these would need to be within the planning application description and assessed together.",
    "The implementation of Y0355.22 and P1843.22 should it be approved, at the same time may invalidate one or both of these applications and as a result a fresh planning application may be required as the proposal would be contrary to the approved plans and the proposal would fail to comply with permitted development as the proposal would be more th",
    "Party Wall Informative",
    "This planning permission does not remove the need to obtain any separate consent of the owner of the adjoining property prior to commencing building works on, under, above or immediately adjacent to their property (e.g. foundations or guttering). The Party Wall Etc. Act 1996 contains requirements to serve notice on adjoining owners of property under certain circumstances, and a procedure exists for resolving disputes. This is a matter of civil law between the two parties, and the Local Planning Authority are not involved in such matters.",
    "A free guide called \"The Party Wall Etc Act 1996: Explanatory Booklet\" is available on the website of the Department for Communities and Local Government.",
