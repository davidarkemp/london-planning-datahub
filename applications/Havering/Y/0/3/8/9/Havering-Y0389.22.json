    "The Council consider that the impact of the proposed development would unacceptably harm the amenity of  the adjacent neighbours at Nos.23 and 29 Melville Road, Rainham by reason of loss of light, outlook and overbearing effect on these properties.",
    "The proposal would not be Permitted Development as the eaves height of the proposed extension would be higher than the eaves of the original dwelling and therefore the proposal does not comply with Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
