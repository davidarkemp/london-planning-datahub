    "The Council consider that the proposed development by reason of its excessive depth, bulk, scale and mass would unacceptably harm the amenity of the neighbouring residents at No. 175 Main Road, Romford, by reason of loss of light, outlook and overbearing effect on this property.",
    "The proposal would not comply with the criteria as outlined under Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as works had commenced on site prior to the Larger Homes Extension Application being determined and therefore fail to comply with permitted development guidelines.",
    "The proposal fails to meet provision (j) of Class A as it has a width greater than half the width of the original dwelling; (where there is a staggered original rear wall or where the proposal extends beyond the rear wall).  Even with the intent to demolish the furthest forward rear wall, case law advises that the 'original' rear wall is the element to be taken into consideration.",
    "This written notice indicates that the proposed development would not comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is important to note that this written notice does not indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations of conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.",
