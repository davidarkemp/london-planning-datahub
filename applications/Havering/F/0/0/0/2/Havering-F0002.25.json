    "The proposed structure in the absence of evidence otherwise would be visually prominent and of a scale which would dominate the landscape. The applicant has not demonstrated that the scale and proportions, including development footprint and volume of the structure sought is genuinely required and proportionate to the use of the wider site as a whole. Accordingly it is considered that there is conflict with the objectives of Schedule 2, Part 6, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
