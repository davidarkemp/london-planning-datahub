    "T2 - Ash Crown reduction by approximately 1.5 metres from the tip as part of general",
    "maintenance",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The applicant is required to give 7 working days notice of when the work for which consent is granted is to be carried out.",
    "Reason:",
    "To give the council the opportunity to make arrangements to supervise the work.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "The applicant is advised that if you wish to carry out further works to the above tree[s] you will need to obtain our further consent.",
    "Anyone who takes, damages or destroys the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is in use or being built is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and prior to commencing work you should ensure that no nesting birds will be affected.",
    "Anyone who kills, injures or disturbs bats, obstructs access to bat roosts or damages or disturbs bat roosts, even when unoccupied by bats, is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 2007. Prior to commencing work you should ensure that no bats or bat roosts would be affected. If it is suspected that a bat or bat roost is likely to be affected by the proposed works, you should consult Natural England (tel. 0845 6003078)",
    "Please note that if the work for which consent is granted is not carried out within 2 years of the date of this letter, it will be necessary to submit a fresh application if it is intended to implement the work.",
    "You should comply with British Standard No. 3998 'Recommendations for Tree Work' a copy of which can be inspected at this office. You are advised that the work should be undertaken by a competent and suitably qualified tree contractor.",
    "T1 - Oak Fell to ground level due to large cracking of patio and dropping/lifting of areas",
    "making a trip hazard for the client.",
    "The applicant has not provided any information to confirm that the cracking is due to T1",
    "and without this the request to fell will not be approved. As they have stated that this patio",
    "is a trip hazard for the client, it is recommended that the patio surfacing is removed to",
    "confirm the presence of the root in causing the damage, as well as confirming the root(s)",
    "as belonging to T1 Oak. Without this information to confirm the trees involvement, the",
    "request to fell is not sufficient.",
    "Works would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the local area.",
    "The justification/evidence submitted is not sufficient to warrant the work applied for.",
    "Without sufficient justification and evidence proving why the tree is unsafe and why lesser courses of action cannot be followed, any future applications requesting to fell without this information will be refused."
