    "Removal of deadwood from the crown of the Horse Chestnut tree T7, and dead wood in Hazel T8 of submitted tree survey.",
    "The removal of deadwood is not covered by the TPO process so there is no requirement to gain permission to remove this, but this is covered as a notification that work is intended to remove this dead wood from the identified trees.",
    "It is recommended that the Horse Chest shown as T6 on the tree survey data and part of group G2 can be felled as it is in decline due to decay in the stem, T7 of the same group G2 can be reduced by 1m beyond previous pruning points, Holly tree T10 shown as T5 on Havering's TPO 1/87 can  be overall crown reduced by up to 1m.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents."
