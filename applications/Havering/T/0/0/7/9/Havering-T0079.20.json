  "description": "The trees have become overgrown in the 10 years that we have lived at the property. We would like to clear the ivy that has grown over the trunks and trim and thin out and re-shape the overgrown area, which is now taking over the top of our garden shed to also clear the ivy as mentioned and to tidy the tree's so that the trunks can be seen. The tree to the left that belongs to the neighbour over the fence will need the branches to be trimmed back. Once trimmed it is anticipated that our trees will be at fence height.",
