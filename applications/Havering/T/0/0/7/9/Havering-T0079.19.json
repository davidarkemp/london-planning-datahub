    "It is recommended that these Conifer trees shown as group G2 and G3 on the plan of Havering's TPO 24/91, can not be felled.",
    "Though the individual trees are poor towards 2 Heather Avenue, with exposed trunks and brown dead wood this will be masked by the new development, they presently provide a good screen between the residential properties and the service station and A12 Road. In the Arboricultural report and Arboricultural implications assessment, dated 16th October 2017 prepared by J. M. Moore it refers to BS 5837:2012, that these conifers have been given a border line c/u rating as although poor they have visual importance.",
    "The applicant is advised that if you wish to carry out further works to the above trees you will need to obtain our further consent."

  "description": "Removal of a line of conifers, of varying sizes, along the boundary line between 2 Heather Avenue RM1 4SL and Shell Rise Park (Petrol Station) RM1 4SJ. The conifers are located just on the side of the petrol garage, yet overhang the boundary so encroach into 2 Heather Avenue. \n\nThe conifers are not only dilapidated, unsightly and un-maintained, but they also block out light to both parties. They have also been hacked at down one side, exposing the trunk and brown dead wood, which will not grow back. The conifers are also preventing the construction of a new dwellinghouse that is proposed to the side garden of 2 Heather Avenue, as it is due to be built right up to the boundary. The proposed new dwellinghouse is called 2A Heather Avenue RM1 4SL, and the approved planning permission drawings are submitted as part of this TPO Consent Application, for thoroughness. \n\nThe conifers that are to be removed total 18m in linear length, and the conifers to be removed are indicated in red on drawing ref TPO001. Any screening that is provided by the conifers will be replaced by the proposed new dwellinghouse structure. The 2m high fence to the boundary will also be retained.",
