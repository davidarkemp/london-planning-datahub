  "description": "T1 - Blue Atlas Cedar - Reduce height by approx. 3 metres and the sides by approx. 2 - 3 metres.\nThe Cedar tree has been reduced previously and is situated next to a grade 2 listed Church. It also overhangs the pavement and it is on this side where the tree has recently had limbs split out due to storm Eunice. I would recommend the following works to prevent limbs failing in the near future.",
