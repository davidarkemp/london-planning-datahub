    "It is recommended that this tree which stands to the rear of 40 Parkway which is within the Gidea Park Conservation Area, may be felled.",
    "The six week evaluation period has expired, and the Arboricultural Officer has reviewed this request for these works and does not consider that this tree meets the criteria for protecting the tree with a tree preservation order.",

    "Anyone who takes, damages or destroys the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is in use or being built is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and prior to commencing work you should ensure that no nesting birds will be affected.",
    "You should comply with British Standard No. 3998 'Recommendations for Tree Work' a copy of which can be inspected at this office. You are advised that the work should be undertaken by a competent and suitably qualified tree contractor.",
    "Please note that if the work for which consent is granted is not carried out within 2 years of the date of this letter, it will be necessary to submit a fresh application if it is intended to implement the work."
