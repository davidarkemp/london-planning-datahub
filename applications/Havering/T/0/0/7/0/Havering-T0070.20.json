  "description": "I have two Ash trees with TPO's on them in my back garden. They are fully mature. I am concerned that they are unsafe and suffering Ash disease. They are very large and adjacent to neighbours houses /gardens following development some years ago. A large bough has snapped off one and is currently suspended, partly supported from another branch.\nI request that both trees be removed from the TPO list allowing me to have them assessed and removed if necessary. \nThere are many, many trees in my garden including a large mature maple right next to the Ash.",
