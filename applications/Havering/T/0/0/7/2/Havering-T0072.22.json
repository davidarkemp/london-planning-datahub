  "description": "The 4 Lime trees labelled G2 on the TPO located in front of the building at 64 Station Lane require pruning to a reasonable size as they are causing overhang problems at street level and for our neighbouring property at 66 Station Lane. Ourselves and our neighbour at no 66 are very concerned about the size the trees have now reached and the impact this may be causing to the foundations of both properties. In addition we wish to avoid any issues with the shared access drive way located between no 64 and no 66 caused by the excess size of the trees labelled G2. We plan to contract qualified tree surgeons to undertake this work once approval has been granted.",
