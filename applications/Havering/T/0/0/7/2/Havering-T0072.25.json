  "description": "I live at 3 Brockton Close, RM1 4EQ which backs onto the garden of 41 Main Road. The large tree in question has branches and overhangs our house. It is also fairly old and unkept and branches/twigs/horse chestnuts themselves and other bits of the tree fall into our garden. This is dangerous as they hit our father (whom I care for)  our grandchildren and our dog (ourselves as well).\nWe have obtained permission before to have the tree cut back so there is no overhang ( i refer you to Application T0154.17 on 01/11/2017 & the planning permission granted by Bob Roper under reference RR/tpo/16/73 on 29/04/2004.\nBoth times works were carried out in accordance with BS 3998:1989. and BS3998:2010.\nA letter was also sent by you to the owner at 41 Main Road who allowed access.\nThe tree needs about 20% cut back this time and the removal of any dead limbs.\nPlease can you authorise urgently as i fear that harm may be done as above and it hasn't been trimmed for 8 years.",
