Three of these are recommended for removal irrespective of development proposals.\nThe trees are protected by TPO/11/85.\nTree protection measures have been specified which are achievable and sufficient to protect trees during the proposed works.\nIn my opinion the proposed development is achievable in both arboricultural terms and in relation to planning policy as it applies to trees.",
