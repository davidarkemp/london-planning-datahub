Part of regular maintenance of the tree and works due to excessive shading.\n\n\nRoad Tree T2 - Crab Apple\tCut back limbs by 1m from road and lift canopy to 3m from ground level if council allows. This is a street tree that is hanging low and could do with a lift and cut back to stop canopy being hit by passing vehicles.\n\nRear Garden T3 - Oak\tMake new Pollard @ approximately 10 metres from ground level reducing the longer laterals in by 3/4 metres from the tips. Remove epicormic growth. This is due to excessive shading in the garden because the customer is very over shadowed by neighbouring trees and believes the tree could be reduced back further than previously reduced.",
