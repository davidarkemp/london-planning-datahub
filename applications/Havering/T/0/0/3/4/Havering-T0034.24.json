  "description": "The tree T1 on TPO 25/82, a London Plane, is outside of our site boundary. The overhang of the tree and in particular the spread of the branches are now inhibiting our main site entrance.\nAs the spring approaches and the tree is beginning to come into season, it is attracting pigeons which are causing a lot of mess and disruption due to droppings at our main site entrance to employees and visitors alike. This is now causing a serious health risk.\n\nThe works we would like to carry out is pruning of the overhanging branches around the entrance footpaths, back to the site boundary.\nAn Arborist has been engaged and advise that general pruning works back to the site boundary will be sufficient. He advised to apply for the permission.",
