  "description": "3 trees subject to TPO, on St Georges Hospital site. Remove trees for the following reasons -  1. Small cherry tree in front garden overhanging public footway. This is partially dead and frequently falls onto the public highway. 2. Small unknown tree in front garden overhanging public footway and adj ambulance station. This is currently interfering with vehicles to both addresses and is preventing the installation of a new boundary fence. 3. Tall unknown tree in rear garden, whilst this has been a tree we intended to retain, the installation of a sewer tank & pump within 1.5m on the trunk has necessitated cutting through numerous roots which it is believed has compromised the tree's integrity. etc",
