  "decision_conditions": [
    "It is recommended that the Poplar T9 can be felled, as there is cavity in the main stem to east  from the base extending  to beyond 2m, also signs of soft rot to the buttress to the west. There is evidence of exit holes from an infestation of Hornet Moth at the base and the rear of the tree at 1.5m.",
    "Poplar T10 can be overall crown reduced by up to 3m to previous pruning points.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "Having considered the particular circumstances of the case and the position of the tree for which consent to fell has been granted the Council has decided that it will not be necessary to replace the Poplar tree T9."
