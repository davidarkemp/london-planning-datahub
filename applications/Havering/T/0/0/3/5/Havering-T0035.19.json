    "It is recommended that these trees identified in the Arboricultural Condition Report 40748 and shown on the Havering TPO plan 4/89 can be felled.",
    "These trees were flagged up as potentially dangerous by Mitie Landscapes Ltd and a notice to fell was requested by Padbury Group Ltd. These trees were inspected by T Goldrick 11th February 2019 and this is confirmation that the removal of the Poplar Trees as identified as T1 to T4 and T6 to T27 on Havering's TPO plan 4/89 can be completed.",
    "That the trees for which consent for removal is granted shall be replaced by heavy-standard container grown, 12-14 cm girth, within the first available planting season (November to March) following the removal of the original trees. Failure to plant the replacement trees as required can lead to enforcement action.",
    "THE APPLICANT SHALL NOTIFY THE LOCAL PLANNING AUTHORITY IN WRITING WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF THE PLANTING BEING CARRIED OUT, SO THAT THE REPLACEMENT TREE CAN BE INSPECTED.",
    "Reason:",
    "In the interests of public amenity and to enable the Council to update its records."
