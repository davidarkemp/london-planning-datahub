    "Removing any dead wood as part of general care for the tree.",
    "The removal of deadwood is not covered by the TPO process so there is no requirement to gain permission to remove this, but this is covered as a notification that work is intended to remove this deadwood from the Oak tree.",

The large lower limb that is growing in a southerly direction can be reduced back to the main scaffold branches by up to 2m to reduce the overhang to the garden and neighbouring properties.",
