  "description": "T3 and T5 Hawthorne Trees. Remove. The 2 Hawthorne bushes have been overwhelmed by a Privet hedge, I wish to remove the whole hedge and replace with low level shrubs including Rhodendron and Roses and build a low level retaining wall. This will prevent overgrowth extending into pavement, as it is doing now, and to enable an unobstructed view to vehicles coming out of the front drives of mine and adjacent neighbours.\n\nT6 Purple Leaved Plum Tree. Remove. The tree is leaning dangerously on to the pavement, and trunk and roots creating a trip hazard for pedestrians. Given the poor state of the tree, I am concerrned that the tree is a potential danger of falling down and a risk to passers by and vehicles. I wish to replace the tree with an ornamental Magnolia tree, locating safely within the boundary behind a low level retaining wall.",
