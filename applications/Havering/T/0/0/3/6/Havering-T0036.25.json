  "description": "The tree marked T7 on the sketch plan is a copper beech (Fagus Sylvatica Purpurea).\n\nWhen in foliage the crown of the tree casts an extensive permanent shadow over half of the small rear gardens at nos 12 and 14 Chalforde Gardens RM2 6BU.\nThe effect is a severe lack of sunlight considerably reducing space available for recreation and cultivation.  The gardens of nos 10 and 18 are similarly affected but to a lesser extent.\n\nA solution to the shadow problem was sought from a firm of tree surgeons.\n\nIn accordance with advice received from the tree surgeons, this application is for a crown reduction (3 metres).  Merely cutting back the lowest branches would not be effective due to overhanging branches at a higher level.",
