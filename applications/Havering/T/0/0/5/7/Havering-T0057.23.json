Over the 10 years we have lived at the property the tree has grown. I am not looking to do any major work on the tree however requesting permission to cut back 2/3 of the lower branches that are now overhanging over the lawn area where my children play. On occasions small branches / twigs break away from the tree and fall in this area. i am requesting permission to trim these branches so they are safe and items do not fall on them.",
