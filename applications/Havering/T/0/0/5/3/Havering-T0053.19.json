  "description": "T70 and T72 walnut,  both trees require removal due to plan to reduce size of roundabout to increase turning circle for large coaches visiting site (there have been near misses with coaches hitting listed buildings).  Although trees cannot be replaced in the same location,  two evergreen trees (Scots pine and Douglas Fir) will be planted in the woodland area near the entrance to the site.  Yew (not attributed a tree number in past survey but highlighted on the map)  to be removed for health and safety reasons (young children were picking up berries to eat).  Replaced with columnar Lawson cypress.  Small holly tree to side of building near yew (not attributed a tree number)  to be removed as this is causing cracking to the steps.  T60 Corsican pine to lift lowest 4-5 branches to front of tree to alleviate stress (a large Oak tree was sited behind this which failed and had to be removed,  leaving a large gap in the growth of the pine on one side) and to balance rest of crown.  T52 Horse Chestnut this tree is dead and so it is proposed to remove all branches and leave as monolith for wildlife habit.  T38 Sycamore,  T39 Willow and T40 Alder to remove.  The willow has failed twice already. The site plans to open up the pond and develop as a wildlife habitat installing a viewing platform and safe walkway at the location of these three trees.  Replacement trees (evergreens to increase diversity of bird species will be planted Colorado blue spruce,  Japanese white pine and Cedar of Lebanon further to the north of the pond).  T30 Horse Chestnut to reduce crown overall by 2m and remove rubbing limb on second union.   T25 Oak to remove all dead wood and balance crown.  To remove four self set very small trees growing near to T25 within area marked as G2. To remove small self-set sycamore within woodland area (not attributed tree number in previous survey)  marked on map as this is growing between two larger sycamores and will never reach any potential (thinning required).",
