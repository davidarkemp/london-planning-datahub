    "Removal of dead ivy, from Ash tree, which is part of Group G2 on TPO plan 19/85.",
    "Ivy is not covered by the TPO process so permission is not required for this work, but this is covered as an notification that work is intended to remove this from the Ash tree.",
    "It is recommended that the Oak tree T3, can be overall crown reduced by up to 2m, and the Ash tree showing as part of the group  G2 on the Havering TPO plan 19/85, can be overall crown reduced by up to 2m from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the trees balanced.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date)."
