    "It is recommended that this Blue Atlantic Cedar tree T4 as shown on the Havering TPO plan 27/80 can have the main central part of crown by 3 metres branch length and upright reiteration growth by 4 metres branch length reduced. Reduce lateral crown spread by up to 3 metres branch length back to suitable growing points, from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the tree balanced.",

  "description": "1 x Blue Atlantic Cedar - reduce main central part of crown by 3 metres branch length and upright reiteration growth by 4 metres branch length. Reduce lateral crown spread by up to 3 metres branch length back to suitable growing points & remove deadwood. \nThe tree does not appear to have been managed for some time, there are a number of large dead branches & a potential decay column into the main trunk from a shed limb wound at 3.5 metres; & the tree has recently shed a large branch. \nWorks are required as routine management to reduce branch leverage & sail effect in windy conditions.",
