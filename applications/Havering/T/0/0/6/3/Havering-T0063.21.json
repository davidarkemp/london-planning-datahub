    "It is recommended that these two Pine trees T7 & T8 as shown on the Havering TPO plan 8/81 can be overall crown reduced by up to 2m from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the trees balanced, the crowns can be thinned by up to 10% to allow more light into the properties and reduce the risk of snow loading on the canopy, the right hand tree can have the two lowest limbs removed and the left hand tree adjacent to the fence can have the lowest branch reduced, to help alleviate shading to the neighbours garden and to bring the canopy to a uniform shape.",
