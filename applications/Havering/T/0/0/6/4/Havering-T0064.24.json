Reduce side branches to previous cutting points up to 2m off, clearing branches back to the trunk on the Flats side to give maximum clearance.\nThe adjacent Flats have been built too close to the Tree, and this has caused branches touching the roof, windows and wall of the Flats, this also leads to shading issues to the window of the flats.
