  "description": "Removal/felling of Whitebeam.  There is no immediate urgency as the trunk and branches are propping up the neighbour's bush and providing privacy.  I also like to hang things artistically on the dead wood.  I don't know if the Whitebeam has a TPO, as the Walnut did, or if it needs replacing.  The honey fungus is currently in the flower bed and a few small bushes have died nearby.  It would not be prudent to plant anything too soon in case the fungus kills it.  Please let me know if you think it should be replaced.  I have a large number of trees and bushes in the garden, so another one would not be a problem (apart from the honey fungus).",
