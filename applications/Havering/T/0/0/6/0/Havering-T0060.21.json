  "description": "Line of leylandii conifers owned by Shell adjacent to the boundary with No 2 Heather Avenue and found 3 in urgent need of removal (Photos 1 & 2).\n \nIn short, what seems to be as a result of current building works at No 2 Heather Avenue (Photos 3 & 4) conducted extremely close to and well within the trees' Root Protection Area, ground and the trees have been disturbed.\n \nIn turn, ground disturbance has caused the likelihood of one tree to become unstable in high winds (Photo 5), another now moveable with little force by hand (Photo 6) and a third damaged by, I would suggest, some form of mechanical equipment at the base and now leaning against an adjacent healthy tree (Photo 7).\n \nSince the 3 trees are all within a potential line of fall into the petrol station's forecourt (Photo 8), clearly, there is a genuine high risk of potential serious harm or damage if not made safe by removal.\n \nThe leylandii are within the blanket TPO 2491 (attached) hence this 5 Days Notice of Intention to Complete Tree Works.  Kindly note our intention to mitigate the risk of serious harm or damage is to remove the 3 trees on Wed 28 Apr next week.\n \nThe works will be carried out by qualified arborists to BS requirements and we will of course thoroughly check for both nesting birds and roosting bats and adjust works as necessary if any are present.",
