  "description": "T1 Ash -  Make new Pollard @ approximately 6 metres from ground level. \nWe reduced this tree earlier in the year and one of the team noted there was a lot of movement in the main stem. I advised that the customer should keep an eye out for fruiting bodies this time of year and sure enough, there was one approximately 20ft up on the main stem. I sent a team to return and film the movement in the tree while it was being pulled from the ground with the climbing line. The video isn't too clear but there is definitely movement in the stem. Because of where it is in the front garden and how busy the road gets, the customer would like to pollard the tree for safety reasons.",
