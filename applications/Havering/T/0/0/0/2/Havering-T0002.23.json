  "description": "All tree works due to massively shaded garden and part of general maintenance of trees.\n\nAlso, when carrying out dead wooding works to T9 earlier in the year, we inspected a very large limb with large cavities in (visible from the ground). We think there is too much decay for the weight of the limb and that to just remove this limb would unbalance the tree so have advised that the tree be felled. Pictures have been supplied.\n\n\nT5 Hawthorn\tFell to ground level and remove all arisings due to large amounts of deadwood in crown and major decline in canopy.\n\nT8 (side of house)\t\nOak\tCrown Reduction - Reducing the height and spread of the tree by up to 3/4 metres to re-balance crown from previous cut back works and to stop over hang onto roof by chimney flue. \n\nT8(a) Hawthorn Fell to ground level and remove all arisings due to garage extension plans and low amenity value. \t\n\nT9\tOak\tFell to ground level and remove all arisings. This is due to 2 x large limbs with major cavities with over 2/3 limb heart wood integrity gone. Fell to allow other trees either side to fill space. \n\nT9(a) Oak Crown Reduction - Reducing the height and spread of the tree by up to 2 metres and back from car parking space outside garage door to reduce acorn fall on the driveway due to father in law slipping on nuts. \t\n\t\nT10\tOak\tCrown Reduction - Reducing the height and spread of the tree by up to 1/2 metres in places. Back from car parking space. \t\n\nT11\tOak\tCrown Reduction - Reducing the height and spread of the tree by up to 3/4 metres\t\n\nT12\tSycamore\tCrown Reduction - Reducing the height and spread of the tree by up to 1/1.5 metres back from neighbours property and to match Oak canopy reduction above this tree. \n\nT13\tLime\tCrown Reduction - Reducing the height and spread of the tree by up to 1 metre to keep in-line with reduction of Oak canopy above and to cut back over hang from driveway",

    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",
    "The applicant is advised that if you wish to carry out further works to the above tree[s] you will need to obtain our further consent.",
    "Having considered the particular circumstances of the case and the position of the tree for which consent to fell has been granted the Council has decided that it will not be necessary to replace the tree.",
    "Anyone who takes, damages or destroys the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is in use or being built is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and prior to commencing work you should ensure that no nesting birds will be affected.",
    "Anyone who kills, injures or disturbs bats, obstructs access to bat roosts or damages or disturbs bat roosts, even when unoccupied by bats, is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 2007. Prior to commencing work you should ensure that no bats or bat roosts would be affected. If it is suspected that a bat or bat roost is likely to be affected by the proposed works, you should consult Natural England (tel. 0845 6003078)",
    "Please note that if the work for which consent is granted is not carried out within 2 years of the date of this letter, it will be necessary to submit a fresh application if it is intended to implement the work.",
    "You should comply with British Standard No. 3998 'Recommendations for Tree Work' a copy of which can be inspected at this office. You are advised that the work should be undertaken by a competent and suitably qualified tree contractor.",
    "Non Standard reason. Works to tree are specified as necessary for a development at the property. This tree and the others would be a material consideration of the planning process and as such the removal of T8(a) is to be considered with the development."
