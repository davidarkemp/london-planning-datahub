    "Removal of deadwood.",
    "The removal of deadwood is not covered by the TPO process so there is no requirement to gain permission to remove this, but this is covered as a notification that work is intended to remove this deadwood from the Oak tree.",
    "It is recommended that this Oak tree, T13 as shown on the Havering TPO plan 14/76 can be crown lifted to 4m, the large branch that is growing toward the property, 40 Barleycorn Way can be crown reduced by up to 3m and the remaining overhanging crown to the property 40 Barleycorn Way reduced by up to 2.5m to balance.",
