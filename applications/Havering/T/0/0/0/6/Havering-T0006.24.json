  "description": "An arborist from Crown Tree Services recently removed a dead tree on Spire View Court under planning application T0115.23.  On their advice, it is highlighted that a tree approximately at position G2 on TPO 4/74 is dead/dying and is a danger to the property, residents and passers by of the development.\n\nA further tree has been identified as having some dead wood and requires \"dead wooding\".  This tree is approximately at position G1 on TPO 4/74.\n\nThe TPO covers the Dury Falls Estate which has now been redeveloped and renamed Spire View Court.\n\nWe are requesting permission to remove the tree and dispose of and remove all movable waste related to the tree from the site.\n\nWe are not proposing to replace the tree, given the development already has significant green foliage giving the property an aesthetically pleasing look and appeal in keeping with the local area.  The trees on the property have also create a large amount of garden waste which has created blockages in guttering which in November 2022 caused some internal water leak/flooding to the two of the properties.",
