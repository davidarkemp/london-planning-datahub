The tree is currently dropping lots of deadwood, posing a safety hazard to my family. We believe a whole crown reduction / hard cut back is essential for the health of the Oak Tree as well as maintaining the integrity of our home and outdoor living space and ensuring the safety of our family.\n\nWe are requesting a reduction of 3m from the tips",
