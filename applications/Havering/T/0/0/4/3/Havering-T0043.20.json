    "It is recommended that this group of trees, situated in the rear garden, on the boundary of 51 Heath Drive, consisting of a mixed species, including ash, prunus, cypress and ivy, which is within the Gidea Park Conservation Area may be removed.",
    "Please note that if the work for which consent is granted is not carried out within 2 years of the date of this letter, it will be necessary to submit a fresh application if it is intended to implement the work.",
    "Whilst permission is granted for the removal of the mixed species of tree identified as group TG1, consisting of ash, prunus, cypress and ivy. It is recommended that the ash and prunus are removed as a phased removal. The cypress should potentially removed at a later date,  as although there were no coniferous roots found in the bore hole, this tree will be implicated by its close proximity to 45 Reed Pond Walk  and therefore if removed initially could compound any heave implications."
