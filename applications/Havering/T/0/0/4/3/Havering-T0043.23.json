  "description": "Please refer to the tree survey p. 35 for aerial sketch plan.  Additional seperate sketch plan has also been provided with street names, addresses, north direction indicator as requested.\n\nT5 - Robinia pseudo acacia:  remove due to poor condition including dieback of canopy and dead branches, as described in the tree report (on the TPO, this is numbered a part of a group of trees, G2).  This tree has been in decline for a number of years, is unattractive and has limited amenity value.  We are concerned that this tree may pose a danger in case of storm.  We think the landscape would be improved by removal and replacement per our proposed plan.\nT6 - Ilex aquifolium:  remove to facilitate proposed landscaping scheme \nT4 - Taxus beccata: remove to facilitate proposed landscaping scheme. This is a self seeded tree that is growing underneath more dominant tree (T3 Ash) so has limited potential in the garden.  \n\nThese trees will be replaced with 3 birch (Betula) trees. Approximate size 45L 10-12cm multi stem.  Please see proposed planting plan for location of new trees.",
