    "It is recommended that the most southerly White Poplar of the group G8 can be felled to ground level as this tree has historic storm damage and is structurally unsafe. The central tree can be overall crown reduced by up to 3m and the most northerly tree overall crown reduced buy up to 3.5, from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the tree balanced.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "Having considered the particular circumstances of the case and the position of the tree for which consent to fell has been granted the Council has decided that it will not be necessary to replace the tree."
