  "description": "Oak T1 growing in rear garden of 15 Ashburnham Gardens\nThe proposed works are to remove the 3 lower limbs to the western Engayne Gardens side of the tree.\nThese limbs are to be removed to balance the appearance of the canopy and to avoid ongoing management to these 3 lateral limbs that are growing over the highway boundary.  The size of the limbs to be removed, the resultant wounds and the overall health and vigour of the tree confirm that the proposed pruning works will not impact on the appearance, amenity value,  health or longevity of the tree.\nThe proposed works will allow this tree to be retained at an appropriate scale within the gardens of 15 Ashburnham Gardens \nPruning Works will be undertaken follow appropriate guidance in BS3998 (2010)",
