    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",

    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",
    "Having considered the particular circumstances of the case and the position of the tree for which consent to fell has been granted the Council has decided that it will not be necessary to replace the tree.",
    "Anyone who takes, damages or destroys the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is in use or being built is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and prior to commencing work you should ensure that no nesting birds will be affected.",
    "Anyone who kills, injures or disturbs bats, obstructs access to bat roosts or damages or disturbs bat roosts, even when unoccupied by bats, is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 2007. Prior to commencing work you should ensure that no bats or bat roosts would be affected. If it is suspected that a bat or bat roost is likely to be affected by the proposed works, you should consult Natural England (tel. 0845 6003078)",
    "Please note that if the work for which consent is granted is not carried out within 2 years of the date of this letter, it will be necessary to submit a fresh application if it is intended to implement the work.",
