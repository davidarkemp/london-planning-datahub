  "description": "T4 - OAK - FELL \nTPO - REASONS FOR APPLICATION\nThe tree works are proposed to stop the influence of the tree(s) on the soil below building foundation level and provide long term stability.\nEstimated costs of repair to the building are Ã?Â£30k if the influence of the tree(s) remain and 11.2k if the proposed tree works are allowed to proceed. Granting permission will limit these costs. In the event of a refusal we, or our clients, will seek to secure compensation for the additional costs incurred through Section 202(e).\nShould the tree/s remain the total cost of repairs will be the Superstructural repairs + Alternative method of repairs = Â£41.2k\nIt is the expert opinion of both the case engineer and arboriculturalist that on the balance of probabilities the supporting information demonstrates the influence of the tree(s).\nNote: Further monitoring results may be submitted if these become available during the course of this application.",
