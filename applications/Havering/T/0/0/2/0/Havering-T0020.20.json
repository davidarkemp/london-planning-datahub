    "The applicant is advised that if you wish to carry out further works to the above tree you will need to obtain our further consent.",
    "It is understood that this tree causes concerns regarding the health, safety and well-being, of users of this area, from the evidence given there are no management plans in place regarding the inspection and maintenance of trees on this site.",
    "Regarding the concerns of branches failing whether it be from, summer branch drop or excessive weight in the crown, this could be minimalised through routine annual inspection and resulting tree pruning recommendations, in line with BS 3998:2010 Tree Work Recommendations."
