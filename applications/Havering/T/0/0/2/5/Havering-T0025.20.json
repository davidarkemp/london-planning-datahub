  "decision_conditions": [
    "It is recommended that this Oak tree, shown as being within area A1 on the plan of Havering's TPO 9/73, can have the overhang reduced back, in line with the boundary of 83 and 85 Westmoreland Avenue but no further, to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the tree balanced.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "You are within your rights to cut back any branches overhanging your property up to the boundary line (but no further). If the person cutting this back, requires to climb the tree to do so then permission is needed from the landowner to gain access to the tree, cuttings should be offered back to the owner to decide how they should be disposed of."
