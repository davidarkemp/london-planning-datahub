  "description": "Eucalyptus- This Eucalyptus is rather large and there is rising concern that if this tree was to fail the damage would be significant. there is small amounts of deadwood in the canopy and I can see why its causing concerns in the wind. I suggest we take around 4-5 metres out the top of the tree and then reduce the rest of the canopy to appropriate growth points",
