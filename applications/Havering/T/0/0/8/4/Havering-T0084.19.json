  "description": "T7 Ash....cut back large lowest limb which is overhanging my garden shed, rear fencing and part of the north west area of my rear garden. In high winds it sways quite a lot and often sends down several branches, some of which can be quite large. It is potentially dangerous to people walking near the shed or could conceivably fall on the shed itself and which of course someone could be in at the time. \n\nThe tree is situated BEHIND my boundary fence to the north east of my REAR garden and also sits outside the western boundary fence of my neighbour at no.11 Spinney Close but seems to be part of the rear garden of 30 Karen Close although the owner states that the tree has never been hers but belonged to another property's garden that was sold off for building new houses pre 1986 and was likely on the land of a property in Philip Road where the garden extended deep into what is now Spinney Close.\n\nTim Goldrick visited my property in August 2016 to survey the tree and offer advice on tree work at that time, but ownership was never resolved, hence I am now applying for surgery as it affects my garden solely. You have email traffic dated 18/08/16 to support my comments.",
