  "description": "Request to Trim Potentially Hazardous Tree\nThis request is to address a potentially hazardous tree located entirely within my property boundaries at RM13FG. The tree current condition is overgrown with dead branches. The branches are notably uncontrolled and spreading, making contact with and rubbing against the adjacent shed. This contact is causing concern for potential damage to both the shed and potentially the tree itself due to friction.\n\nI am the property owner of 2 Lita Mews and applicant and have a direct interest in ensuring the safety of property and mitigating any potential damage caused by the tree. The neighbouring property owner may also have an interest in ensuring the tree does not pose a risk to their property, though the tree is fully contained within my boundaries.\n\nThe reason for these works is primarily safety and property protection. The current contact between the branches and the shed presents a risk of:\n\n1. Damage to the shed structure (e.g., scratching, abrasion, eventual structural compromise).\n2. Damage to the tree from constant rubbing.\n3. Potential for falling branches due to an unbalanced or overgrown canopy, especially during adverse weather conditions and dead branches.\n4. These works aim to alleviate these concerns and ensure the tree remains safe and well-maintained.\n\nAt present, no replacement trees are intended to be planted, as the aim is to trim and reduce the existing tree, not to remove it. If, however, it is determined that the tree is under a TPO and the required works necessitate its removal, I am open to discussing suitable replacement tree options in line with any TPO conditions.",
