    "It is recommended that this Oak tree T1 as shown on the Havering TPO plan 30/87, can be overall crown reduced by up to 3m over the building and the remaining half of the crown towards the garden can be reduced by 2m from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the Oak tree balanced. There are two lower limbs over the garden area that can be removed at point of origin to rebalance the tree.",

    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
