  "description": "Removal of 15 conifers in rear garden. The conifers have had to been reduced slightly due to dead wood over hanging neighbours garden. We are now concerned these could damage the neighbours property if left in situation. As they are very close to their property. There is also one on the opposite side of the garden next to our footpath and there has been some large branches come down. We are concerned that one could fall on us whilst in the garden. We have checked with planning and there are no TPOÃ¢??s on any of our trees in the garden. We have many lovely native trees which will also benefit from the removal of these conifers as that are affecting the light these trees need. We would also like to replace the conifers with more native trees. We have been advised by a tree surgeon they the stumps would require stump grinding.",
