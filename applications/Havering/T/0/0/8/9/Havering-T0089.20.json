    "It is recommended that the lime trees identified as Groups G5 and G6 of TPO 15/05 by Nursery Walk can be re-pollard to previous pruning points as completed as a  three year maintenance cycle so as to maintain high pollard points and no cuts bigger than 80mm to be completed unless severe decay is detected.",

    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an pollard, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
