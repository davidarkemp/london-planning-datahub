  "decision_conditions": [
    "It is recommended that these Hawthorn trees can be pruned as follows, the group of Hawthorns (1-4) on the left hand side of the  drive adjacent to 2 Rayburn Road, may be pruned back to the kerb edge of the driveway and the overhang to 2 Rayburn Road, cut back to the boundary, and the height reduced to previous pruning points.  The Hawthorn trees (7&8) in the central bed can be overall crown reduced by up to 1.5m, crown thinned by up to 10% and have the overhang to the grass verge reduced to the middle of the verge and lifted 3m, so that the branches do not encroach over the footpath.",
    "Trees 5/6, the tree  T5 is now dead and the tree T6 is in decline, since they were last pruned T5 has died and T6 has put on very little growth, these two trees can be removed as one is dead and the other is in decline.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "That the trees for which consent for removal is granted shall be replaced by one of the following species;",
    "Silver Birch (Betula spp) 12/17m height depending on species",
    "Acer psudoplatanus 'Brilliantissimum' 3/8m height",
    "Acer campestre 'Nanum' 3/7m height",
    "Crataegus x lavalleei 'Cockspur thorn' 5/7m height",
    "Serviceberry (Amelanchier spp) 5/7m height",
    "Pride of India (Koelreuteria paniculata) 3/8m height",
    "Himalyian Birch (Betula utilis jacquemontii) 12/17m height",
    "Cherry (Prunus spp) 5/17m height depending on species",
    "The tree should be a heavy-standard container grown, 12-14 cm girth, on the right hand side of the drive way with in the bed that trees 5&6  were situated, to replace the felled Hawthorns 5&6 and to be completed within the first available planting season (November to March) following the removal of the original tree's. Failure to plant the replacement tree's as required can lead to enforcement action.",
    "THE APPLICANT SHALL NOTIFY THE LOCAL PLANNING AUTHORITY IN WRITING WITHIN TWO",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date)."
