  "description": "Tall eucalyptus tree in my garden that is growing leaning towards the house and is not far from the house. I am worried about the tree being blown down in the wind and landing on the house. The tree also has a long branch growing to the side that has also grown towards the house, further increasing the lean of the whole tree towards the house. The tree is very tall and thin and so leans heavily towards the house in the wind. I estimate the height of the tree to currently be about 20 metres tall. The proposed works are to a (T1) Eucalyptus tree Ã¢?? Whole crown reduction to 14m above ground level, to provide sufficient clearance to property.",
