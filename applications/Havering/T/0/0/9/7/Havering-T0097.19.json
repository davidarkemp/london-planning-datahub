  "description": "Removal of Lime Tree.  I am looking to remove the tree that sits on my property at the front of the house so I can carry out works to the driveway of my home.  The removal will make access to the drive in and out easier and much safer.  We currently have to reverse or drive on, which makes it dangerous to reverse off the property as the traffic speeds around the bend 10 metres away from the property.  We generally have issues with speeding traffic on North Road.  This is currently under consultation with the council and highways agency on how this can be improved.  If this request is granted I am happy to plant a tree in the back garden along with the others I have added since living here.",
