    "The Copper beech tree that is the subject of this application, stands to the right hand side of the front curtilage   of 4 Elm Grove. It is shown as  tree T4 on the plan of Havering's TPO 9/74, can be felled and the stump ground out.",

Failure to plant the replacement tree as required can lead to enforcement action.",
