The hedge prevents maintenance and treatment to the rustic weatherboard on the entire wall and there is now significant damp inside the building. I am also requesting permission to trim all of the hedges around the perimeter of my property as these are again laurels that have not been maintained. There are no trees that are to be removed under these works.",
