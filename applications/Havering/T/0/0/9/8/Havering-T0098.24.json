  "description": "The tree is a Holme oak. We have 3 in our garden. Two of which are in good health. The one in question is completely hollow from the base rising up the tree to the main branches. There is also hollowing out on some large overhanging branches. . The tree surgeon has advised that the tree is now in a very unstable condition and it should be felled as soon as possible to avoid any further damage to the surrounding trees as the tree could topple at any time. We have also been advised not to get close to the tree for safety reasons. I have highlighted the tree in red.",
