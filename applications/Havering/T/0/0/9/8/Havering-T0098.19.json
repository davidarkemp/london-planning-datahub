    "It is recommended that the trees as shown as area A1 on the Havering TPO plan 2/92, and situated in the rear garden, crown reduce the Willow trees back to previous pruning points reducing the trees by no more than 20%. The Grey Poplars to be reduced to previous pollard points removing no more than 25%. The Ash tree with the fungal bracket adjacent to decking, can be felled.

    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
