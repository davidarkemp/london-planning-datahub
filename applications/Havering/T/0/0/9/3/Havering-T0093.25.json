  "description": "formally request permission to fell a mature Sweet Chestnut tree (Castanea sativa) located at 24 Nelmes Crescent, RM11 2QB.\n\nDuring a recent site visit, we assessed the tree and found it to be in a severely compromised condition. The tree is completely dead, with no live foliage present, and displays clear signs of advanced decay and structural weakness. Most concerningly, the tree is positioned very close to the residential property and significantly overhangs a main public road, presenting an immediate risk to both people and vehicles.\n\nTree Assessment Overview\n- Species: Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa)\n\n- Location: Rear garden of 24 Nelmes Crescent Ã¢?? overhanging boundary fence and main road\n\n- Condition: Completely dead Ã¢?? no visible signs of life, leaf growth, or cambial activity\n\n- Structural Integrity:\n\nÃ¢?Â¢  - Major limbs are brittle with high risk of sudden failure\nÃ¢?Â¢  - Large sections of the crown are showing extensive dieback\n- Decay Indicators:\n\nÃ¢?Â¢  - Fungal growth present at the base of the tree, suggesting internal decay and likely root compromise\nÃ¢?Â¢  - Bark is delaminating and shedding from the trunk\nÃ¢?Â¢  - Discoloration and softening of core wood in several areas\n- Safety Risk:\n\nÃ¢?Â¢  - Proximity to the property poses a threat to building structure in high winds\nÃ¢?Â¢  - Overhanging a public road Ã¢?? direct danger to pedestrians and motorists\nÃ¢?Â¢  - Presents potential liability to both the resident and the Council if left unaddressed",
