  "description": "Following two reputable tree surgeon opinions, our magnificent copper beech tree sadly has MERIPILUS GIGANTEUS (MERIPILUS). At present this fungus is clearly visible at the roots of the tree. There are over 33 growths so far which is a lot more than last year. IÃ¢??ve been told there is no cure once a beach is infected with this fungus and the rot can kill a tree within a relatively short space of time. Given the close proximity to our house and the sheer size of the tree, the safest option would be to fell it as we could not risk it falling. This is a very difficult application for us especially after it was beautifully pruned less than a year ago. We would never want to fell a tree of this age and grandeur unless totally necessary. We are asking permission to remove this tree.",

    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",

    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",

    "Anyone who takes, damages or destroys the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is in use or being built is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and prior to commencing work you should ensure that no nesting birds will be affected.",
    "Anyone who kills, injures or disturbs bats, obstructs access to bat roosts or damages or disturbs bat roosts, even when unoccupied by bats, is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 2007. Prior to commencing work you should ensure that no bats or bat roosts would be affected. If it is suspected that a bat or bat roost is likely to be affected by the proposed works, you should consult Natural England (tel. 0845 6003078)",
    "Please note that if the work for which consent is granted is not carried out within 2 years of the date of this letter, it will be necessary to submit a fresh application if it is intended to implement the work.",
