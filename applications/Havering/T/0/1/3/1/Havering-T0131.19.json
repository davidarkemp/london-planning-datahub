    "It is recommended that these trees at 20 Meadway, which is within the Gidea Park Conservation Area, can be pruned.  The Magnolia that is situated centrally to the front lawn can be overall crown reduced by 30% and shaped and the Holly in the rear to the left hand side to the flank of the property 22 Meadway, can be overall crown reduced by 40% and reshaped so as to minimise the overhang to 22 Meadway. In the far left hand corner along the rear wall, is a Yew tree this can be overall crown reduced by 30% the left hand sycamore can be pollarded, to take in to account where the branches have being cut back following recent wind damage, and the Conifer to the right hand side can be overall crown reduced by up to 40%.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",
    "The applicant is advised that if you wish to carry out further works to the above trees you will need to obtain our further consent.",
    "Please note that if the work for which consent is granted is not carried out within 2 years of the date of this letter, it will be necessary to submit a fresh application if it is intended to implement the work."
