  "description": "Lowest end of car park \nT1 - Lime tree - Crown Reduce to previous reduction points by approx 1.5m (this tree is in good condition and shape, but growing to close to building. The cut back from building needs to be done but might look unbalanced. It might be better to reduce the whole tree lightly. \n\n*Please note this tree should also have a TPO put on it.\n\nFront of estate\nT2 - Lime Tree - Central drive way. Raise the crown to approx 4m. Crown thin by 30%. Reduce lateral spread by approx 1m to balance crown. Do not reduce height - \nT3 - Ash - Twin stem- Remove mature epicormic shoots from beneath crown break. Crown thin by 20% \nT4 - Ash tree - Raise crown to give clearance of approx 3m from ground level - Remove lowest 4 branches of no more than 2\" diameter over grass area. Crown thin by 20% \nT5 - Ash tree - Crown thin by 20% \nT6 - Ash tree - Raise Crown to give 4m clearance from ground level retaining any major limbs. Reduce back from Cherry by approx 2m\nT7 - Cherry - Reduce over long lateral spread by approx 2m \nT8 - Ash tree - Raise Crown to approx 3-4m, 2nd crown break, retaining major limb at approx 2.5m. Do not reduce crown - (maybe reduce in 3yrs) \nT9 - Yew Tree - Centre of driveway - Lightly reduce back from road by approx 0.5m to allow vehicles to pass.\n\nThis work is for maintenance purposes\n\n*It appears some pruning has happened to the Lime tree, a crown lift and some neighbours ash trees have been heavily lifted.",
