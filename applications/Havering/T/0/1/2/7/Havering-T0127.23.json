  "description": "1, Lime tree and Horse chestnut tree ( G1) \n\n2  Oak tree , T1\n We previously had works approved back in 2016 to perform maintenance works to reduce crown and prune the tree to keep the trees healthy and also maintain good neighbourly relations , as the now larger overhanging branches grow into the restaurant parking area .\nWe want to repeat of what works we performed earlier , the current canopy spread is about 8 to 9m and we would like to reduce by not more then to 5 metres . The lime tree is much less spread to this will be to just reduce dead branches and reduce by about 2 metres .\nThere are neighbouring conifers on rear , which are non TPO , as marked on sketch which will also be pruned to last prune points",
