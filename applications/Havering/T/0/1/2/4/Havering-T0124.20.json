    "It is recommended that these Beech trees situated to the rear of 10 Broadway which is within the Gidea Park Conservation Area, these seven Beech trees are on are on the left hand border backing on to 17 & 18 Heath Drive, the first five beech trees T1 - T5 can be felled as they are outgrowing the retaining walled bed and impacting on the boundary wall.  The remaining two trees T6 & T7 can be reduced, to bring them in line with the existing Beech hedge, eventually formalising them so these become part of the existing hedge line.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",
    "The applicant is advised that if you wish to carry out further works to the above tree[s] you will need to obtain our further consent.",
    "Please note that if the work for which consent is granted is not carried out within 2 years of the date of this letter, it will be necessary to submit a fresh application if it is intended to implement the work."
