  "description": "Fig Tree half way down the garden on the right hand side. The tree is located just to the right of the middle of the garden.  \nThe tree has significantly grown over the last few years and needs to be pruned.  The Fig Tree has not been pruned in over 8 years.  The branches are now all touching the grass and it is not possible to mow the lawn under the tree.   The Fig Tree branches are also making it difficult to access the right hand side of the garden. \nOur gardener has advised that the tree should be reduced by a third all over.  He also said November would be a good time to do this.",
