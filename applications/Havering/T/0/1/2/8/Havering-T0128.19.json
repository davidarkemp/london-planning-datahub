  "decision_conditions": [
    "It is recommended that this Willow tree T6 as shown on the Havering TPO plan 7/10 can be overall crown reduced by up to 3m from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the tree balanced.",
    "Where this Willow tree is growing towards other trees on this site, it can be pruned to alleviate the branch growth through or against other trees. The Prunus to the east can have the branches that are growing through the main canopy reduced to the fork before the Prunus, the remaining branch to the left can be reduced by up to 2m, to stop branches entangling with the branches of the Prunus.  The Hawthorn to the south can have the branches growing through its canopy reduced to the main fork, and the remaining branches pruned to give 1m clearance.  The Silver birch to the west can have the Willow branches pruned away from the Silver birch to give 1m clearance.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",
    "Anyone who kills, injures or disturbs bats, obstructs access to bat roosts or damages or disturbs bat roosts, even when unoccupied by bats, is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 2007. Prior to commencing work you should ensure that no bats or bat roosts would be affected. If it is suspected that a bat or bat roost is likely to be affected by the proposed works, you should consult Natural England (tel. 0845 6003078)"
