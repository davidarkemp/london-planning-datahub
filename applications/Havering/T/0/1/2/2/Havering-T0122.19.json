    "It is recommended that the three Sycamore trees can be crown reduced by up to 2m to previous pruning points, there are concerns regarding the integrity of the remaining ash trees, these can be felled if there are signs of Ash die back in the canopies further to aerial inspection, and one has an excessive lean.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",
    "Having considered the particular circumstances of the case and the position of the Ash tree's for which consent to fell has been granted the Council has decided that it will not be necessary to replace the Ash tree's."
