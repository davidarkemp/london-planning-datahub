  "decision_conditions": [
    "It is recommended that the Cedar tree showing as part as the group G27 on Havering's TPO 25/72 can be felled as it is in decline.",
    "The two Oak trees in the rear can be crown reduced by up to 2m and crown lifted 5m over the sheds, the Ash tree which is on the northern boarders of 7 Burntwood Avenue, and the second Ash tree backs on to 5 Tall Trees Close, can be felled as they are showing signs of sever decay and hollowing trunks, which could eventually fail, these four trees are part of the TPO 7/49 shown as area W28.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "That the Cedar tree for which consent for removal is granted shall be replaced by a Silver Birch, standard container grown, 12-14 cm girth, in the existing tree pit, to the driveway in the front left hand side of 11 Burntwood Avenue, on the flank of 7 Burntwood Avenue, and to be completed within the first available planting season (November to March) following the removal of the original Cedar tree. Failure to plant the replacement tree's as required can lead to enforcement action.",
    "THE APPLICANT SHALL NOTIFY THE LOCAL PLANNING AUTHORITY IN WRITING WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF THE PLANTING BEING CARRIED OUT, SO THAT THE REPLACEMENT TREE CAN BE INSPECTED.",
    "Reason:",
    "In the interests of public amenity and to enable the Council to update its records.",
    "Having considered the particular circumstances of the case and the position of the two Ash trees to the rear of 11 Burntwood for which consent to fell has been granted the Council has decided that it will not be necessary to replace these tree's.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date)."
