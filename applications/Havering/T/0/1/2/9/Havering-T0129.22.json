  "description": "Reduce leaning Pine tree by 3-4 meters. This tree has a large lean on it due to growing away from neighbouring trees. A branch has become the dominant leader over time and requires reducing due to all the weight of the tree being on the side of the lean. \n\nWe would like to reduce the top of the tree by 3-4 meters and reduce the lateral branches in by 1-2 meters. The intention is to take some weight off the lean and to create an aesthetically pleasing balance of the tree whilst finding and pruning at the correct growing points",
