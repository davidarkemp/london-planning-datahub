  "description": "One oak tree is inside our property. The branches need crowning and trimming so as to allow light through. There are also telephone wires which are going across the branches which need to be trimmed to prevent damage. There are branches also above the pavement and the road which can restrict trucks, lorries and coaches from driving on Nelmes road. We had it done a few years ago and we paid the tree surgeon to apply and permission was granted but it took 3 months which is too long. This time we are applying directly but will get a certified tree surgeon to do the work once we have approval.",
