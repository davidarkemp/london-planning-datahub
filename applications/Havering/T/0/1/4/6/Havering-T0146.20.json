    "Removal of deadwood",
    "The removal of deadwood is not covered by the TPO process so there is no requirement to gain permission to remove this, but this is covered as a notification that work is intended to remove this deadwood from the trees listed in the schedule.",
    "It is recommended that the works are carried out as identified in the schedule of works.",

    "T109 Weeping willow, overall reduce crown to previous pruning points.",
    "Group G4, four Leyland cypress fell to ground level.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "Having considered the particular circumstances of the case and the position of the trees for which consent to fell has been granted the Council has decided that it will not be necessary to replace the trees.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
