  "description": "Ash T1 - Pollard to 10 metres in height and remove ivy to fence line - Whole crown die-back progressively over the last 2 to 3 years, major deadwood present in crown,  leading to a  significant risk of personal injury and damage to property.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Removal of ivy to fence line and deadwood.",
    "The ivy is not covered by the TPO process, so permission is not required for this work, also where there is deadwood with in the canopy of the tree, there is no requirement to gain permission to remove this, but this is covered as an notification that work is intended to remove this deadwood from the Ash tree.",
    "It is recommended that this Ash tree shown on the Havering TPO plan 12/06 can be overall crown reduced by up to 2m from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the tree balanced.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",
    "Permission has been granted for an overall crown reduction, as to pollard this tree risks it being put in to a cycle of decline and potentially leading to its demise."
