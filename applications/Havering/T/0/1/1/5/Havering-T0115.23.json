  "description": "On advice on an arborist, the residents of Spire View Court have been told that the Sycamore Tree located and labelled at position T2 on the TPO 4/74 is dead/dying and is a danger to the property and people of the development.\n\nThe TPO covers the Dury Falls Estate which has now been redeveloped and renamed Spire View Court.\n\nWe are requesting permission to remove tree, and local roots and surrounding earth, and dispose of and remove all movable waste related to the tree from the site.\n\nWe are not proposing to replace the tree, given the development already has significant green foliage giving the property an aesthetically pleasing look and appeal in keeping with the local area.  The trees on the property have also create a large amount of garden waste which has created blockages in guttering which in November 2022 caused some internal water leak/flooding to the two of the properties.",
