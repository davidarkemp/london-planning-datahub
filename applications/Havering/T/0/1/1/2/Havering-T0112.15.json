  "description": "Oak - needs removing, branches keep falling down, sap falls on garden furniture the whole of the summer, grass is affected becoming muddy, and the tree is way too big for where it is position.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The Councils Arboricultural officer in communication with the resident has rejected the request to fell this tree but has recommended that the oak tree as shown as T1 Havering's TPO 15/91 can be pruned with out being detrimental to the oak tree's health, the canopy can be crown reduced by 2m from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out as an overall reduction, so that the tree's crown remains balanced.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the tree's stability is maintained and in the interests of public amenity.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
    "Reason:",
    "To ensure that the work is carried out in accordance with good arboricultural practice.",
    "Anyone who takes, damages or destroys the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is in use or being built is guilty of an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and prior to commencing work you should ensure that no nesting birds will be affected.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents."
