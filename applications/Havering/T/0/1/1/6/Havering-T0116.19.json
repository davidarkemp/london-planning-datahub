  "description": "The following trees require removal due to intention to widen pedestrian path for disabled access:\nG1 group of 3 small silver birch trees growing close to fence line, T2 Field Maple this tree has suffered severe bark loss and whilst there was no evidence of any apparent fungal strategy, there is significant dead wood present and sparse canopy. It is proposed to remove this tree to assist with the path widening. T3 Sycamore -this tree is on the edge of the woodland but has poor canopy growth and is in decline. It is also proposed to remove this tree. The Amana Trust has already compensated for the loss of these few trees by planting a variety of tree species (including multi-stem birch trees, Acers, Persian ironwood and a variety of conifers within the woodland area. It is still proposed that eventually a new avenue of Lime trees will be planted along the driveway leading to the main building.",
