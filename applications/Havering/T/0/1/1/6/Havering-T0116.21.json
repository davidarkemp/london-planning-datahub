  "description": "I have enclosed a map ( not to scale of my garden and labelled all the trees within. Please note I am only applying for work to be carried out on Yew trees 1 & 2. Yew Tree no. 1L I would like to be completely felled for the following given reasons: It is probably 70 years old and has become extremely large and problematic. Its root system is lifting pathways and is nearing to the workshop and drain areas. It is also now stunts the shape & growth of a much more attractive Robina Fasica. Another concern is the goodness and shading it is now taking from the perennial border beneath it. All the flowers are fighting for light. If an allowance is made for its removal I would like to replace it with a Rowan Tree, which would be more practical for the areas of my garden.\n\nYew tree no. 2: I would like to apply for this tree to have a crown reduction only, preferably 50% in order to keep it under control.",
