    "It is recommended that these two Ash tree's part of the group G1 as shown on the Havering TPO plan 19/85 can be removed.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out within 2 years from the date of this consent.",
    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "That the two Ash trees for which consent for removal is granted shall be replaced by feathered, heavy standard 14-16cm girth, container grown, either Tulip tree or Sweet gum, no more than 2m from the location of the original trees and within the first available planting season (November to March) following the removal of the original trees. Failure to plant the replacement trees as required can lead to enforcement action.",
    "THE APPLICANT SHALL NOTIFY THE LOCAL PLANNING AUTHORITY IN WRITING WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF THE PLANTING BEING CARRIED OUT, SO THAT THE REPLACEMENT TREE CAN BE INSPECTED.",
    "Reason:",
    "In the interests of public amenity and to enable the Council to update its records.",
    "The two trees when planted should have a  watering regime to aid establishment for a minimum of two growing seasons."
