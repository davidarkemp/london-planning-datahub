  "description": "There are 2 large trees located at the entrance of 4 Reed Pond Walk. The one on the right is subject to a TPO, and I have been advised that the second tree on the left (which is the one we are seeking to remove) is under a Conservation Order. This tree is becoming increasingly dangerous with its growing size and the fact that the roots are growing above a manhole / drainage system. We have had comments from workers from Havering Council also advising they think the tree should be removed and therefore we are requesting for you to have one of your professionals take down the tree, otherwise we will look to have the works carried out by a qualified tree surgeon. This will include removing the full tree including the roots.",
