    "It is recommended that this Oak tree as shown on the Havering TPO plan 8/72 as part of the area A1 as identified on Haverings TPO plan, can be felled.",

    "Reason:",
    "To prevent the accumulation of consents.",
    "It is suggested that you engage the services of a qualified and fully insured tree surgeon to carry out the above work on your behalf (you should ask to see the contractor's insurance certificate and make sure that it is up to date).",
    "Having considered the particular circumstances of the case and the position of the tree for which consent to fell has been granted the Council has decided that it will not be necessary to replace the tree."
