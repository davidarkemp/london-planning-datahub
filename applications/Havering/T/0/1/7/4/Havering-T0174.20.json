    "It is recommended that this Turkish hazel tree that stands centrally to the top rear garden approximately 30m from the property, and is shown on the plan of Havering's TPO 7/49 as area W29 as mixed plantation, can be overall crown reduced by up to 2-3m from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the tree balanced.",
