The tree is in terminal decline - it borders with the footpath which is a danger to the public. \n\nT2 - Lime - Crown thin lower branches and crown lift up to 2.5m over the footpath. Reduce the height by a third. This sapling overhangs the footpath which is below 2.5m. The Lime will benefit from formative pruning. \n\nT3 - Horse Chestnut - Crown reduce by 2.5m. Sever the Ivy and cut back the Ivy to the stem. All of the Horse Chestnut trees have outgrown their location and overhang the house and the entrance road into the college. These trees will benefit from a crown reduction to alleviate weight and prevent limbs from failing in the future. \n\nT4 - Horse Chestnut - Crown reduce by 3m. Sever and cut back the Ivy to the stem. All of the Horse Chestnut trees have outgrown their location and overhang the house and the entrance road into the college. These trees will benefit from a crown reduction to alleviate weight and prevent limbs from failing in the future. \n\nT5 - Horse Chestnut - Crown reduce by 2.5m and sever the Ivy. All of the Horse Chestnut trees have outgrown their location and overhang the house and the entrance road into the college. These trees will benefit from a crown reduction to alleviate weight and prevent limbs from failing in the future. \n\nT6 - Horse Chestnut - Crown reduce the height by 2.5m and reduce sides back to previous (approx. 1.5m).
