    "Removal of Ivy",
    "The ivy is not covered by the TPO process, so permission is not required for this work, but it is noted that the ivy will be removed and severed from the Ash tree T12.",
    "It is recommended that this Ash tree T12 as shown on the Havering TPO plan 32/04 can be overall crown reduced by up to 2m from the tip to an inter-nodal branch break to leave the tree balanced, to include removal of basal epicormic growth.",
    "The work for which consent is granted shall be carried out to the standards detailed in British Standard Document BS 3998:2010.",
