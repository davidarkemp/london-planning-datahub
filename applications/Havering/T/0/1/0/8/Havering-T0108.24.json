Would like trees to be inspected for safety and remove unsafe or dead branches as some fall down in wind and to shape.  Large willow tree needs trimming/pollard and if possible to reduce height as towering over houses and branches hitting houses when windy and worried it will fall over. Also for safety as people sit there in the summer. Can meet on site with the council tree man to discuss. Tree surgeon not found yet until approved.",
