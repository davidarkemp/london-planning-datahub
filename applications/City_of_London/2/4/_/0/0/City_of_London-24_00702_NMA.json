This caused the deterioration of the ivy, which became an unsightly and superfluous facade treatment given the new conditions and contributed negatively to the overall neighbourhood amenity. \rThe Client is looking to remove Planning Condition 9 from the original Planning submission for the site (Ref. 12/00145/FULMAJ) which outlines requirements for maintenance of the green wall located on the eastern elevation. This will enable the removal of the former green wall and the installation of a new facade treatment in the area of works.",
