  "description": "1. Replace French windows on top floor which open on to a small balcony with a sash window (this is in accordance with the advice given by Kristian Kami?ski  ref: Q2016/2803/LBC on 21 July 2016 \"a sash window, however, could be supported\". The sash window would be wooden, single glazed and identical style to the existing sash windows elsewhere in the house. \r\n\r\n2. Replace existing faulty manual opening rooflight with electric opening rooflight (the same size, only method of opening changes)\r\n\r\nThe top floor is two child bedrooms. The changes in 1 and 2 are necessary as the top floor does not currently have adequate ventilation in summer and becomes unbearably hot. The French windows cannot be opened due to a dangerous drop (permission for a safety balustrade was refused in 2016 and sash window suggested)\r\n\r\n3. Replace existing bathroom and kitchen fittings (these dates from c2008), no external modifications, no removal of original features. \r\n\r\nThis is to address wear and tear\r\n\r\n4. The external doorstep area is currently unfinished concrete and a worn limestone step. The doorstep and doorstep areas allow water ingress. We would like to replace the doorstep area to match the original Georgian finish/features. We would welcome your advice in this respect. We would also consider replacing the modern metal stairs with wrought iron Georgian style stairs if this would be supported\r\n\r\nThis is to deal with water ingress and return to original features\r\n\r\n5. Repaint and repair the exterior of the house (in current colour (white). Advice as to whether any particular paint required welcomed.\r\n\r\n6. Repaint interior walls (there is no original paint work - the walls were painted as part of the last renovation in c 2008)\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that any of the proposed changes the building's character as a building of special architectural or historic interest as:\r\n\r\n-\tChange 1 replaces modern french windows with Georgian style sash window\r\n-\tChanges 2 and 3 are like for like chang",
