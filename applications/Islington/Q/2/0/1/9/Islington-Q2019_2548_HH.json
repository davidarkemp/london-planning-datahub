  "description": "Our apartment comprises the raised ground floor of the building with a separate garage downstairs. We own the property on a share of freehold basis as well as the driveway and front garden. \r\nCurrently the garage is accessed externally via the garden and driveway. Since the garage narrows at its deepest portion it is not possible to store a car in and we therefore park on the driveway. \r\nOur family will soon be expanding and we therefore hope to make the garage a more usable working and storage space. To achieve this we would first like to enhance access to the garage space via an internal door connecting the garage to a communal hallway, used by the other four apartments in the building and accessible via our own back entrance. In this way we can access the space without having to go outside. Fire safety is also enhanced with a second exit. \r\nFollowing this we hope to renovate the space with appropriate insulation and according to relevant fire/building regulations. We would very much appreciate advice on how to secure the required approval. \r\nWe then aim to utilise the existing plumbing and sewage pipe, which run through the corner of the room, to install a small toilet/washroom.  \r\nInitial discussions with other residents of the building have yielded no objections to the internal doorway, the residents downstairs ask only that it not be placed directly opposite their own entrance. We are in the process of drawing up a formal party wall agreement. Disturbance will be kept to a minimum and the hallway will be retuned to its former state. \r\nWe appreciate living in a conservation area and do not intend to make any changes to the external appearance of the property. The space will remain accessible via the existing external doors. \r\nCharge for written advice:£286.00 + VAT = £343.20",
