  "description": "To create a split-level rear extension, and thus enlarge the kitchen so that it better meets the needs of modern family living. The proposed extension will match in size those of its immediate neighbours.To create a third-floor extension, which will occupy the rear 2/3 of the current roof level, to match the size of its immediate neighbours (No.20).\r\n• To reinstate the internal staircase between the ground and basement floors, which was lost when the house was subdivided into 2 flats in 1991.\r\n• To remove the rear external metal fire escape stairs, landing and first-floor external door as part of the works to return the house to a single dwelling as per the original design. This will also significantly improve the setting of this house and the group, as well as improving the amenity value of the surrounding properties.\r\n• To reinstate period-correct fireplaces in both ground floor rooms.\r\n• To clad the front basement staircase in a pale stone, and to replace the existing concrete slabs on the front path with matching stone slabs to match other properties within the terrace.\r\n• To make minor internal alterations to the interior layout, thereby improving the plan-form. These include: inserting a pocket door between the two ground floor rooms; increasing the door head heights in these rooms to better match the period scale of these rooms; and removing the later raised floor in the front ground floor room; adding internal shutters to the two windows of the first floor master bedroom.\r\nWritten Advice with Virtual Site Visit: £611.00 + VAT = £733.20",
