  "description": "I wish to replace the old and rotten garden shed at the bottom of my garden. The new outbuilding will perform the function of the old shed but, additionally, act as a workshop and office. I am working from home and I think will be doing so until retiring and this will provide a quieter environment and later, allow me to pursue interests.  The proposed new shed will be 4490mm (east to west) by 2465mm (north to south) giving 397mm between all shed walls and boundaries and so room to perform maintenance. The roof will be single pitch with a slope of around 4 degrees and be around 150mm thick. This will make the north elevation wall 2350mm high keeping within permitted development height restrictions and the south elevation wall be 2200mm. The eaves of the roof will extend 200mm out from north east and west elevations and 400mm from south. The roof will have an asphalt? covering with white fascia and soffit.   The floor will be a 100mm concrete slab on a insulated and waterproofed substructure. The floor will be   surrounded by a drawf wall of engineering brick on a strip foundation and will extend 150mm above ground to a DPC only. The wall will mark the external dimensions. I want this solid base structure to prevent any penetrating damp because I would like to lay a laminate wooden floor on the concrete base and I do not want wood, pressure treated or otherwise, near the base. The previous shed was always rotten near and on the ground as I remember and required a lot of maintenance to keep standing.  On top of DPC will sit the wooden frame walls making the main shed up to the roof. The external render will be wood tongue and groove and have the colour of Disraeli Green. Against this all windows and the door will be framed with white uPVC . The double door will be French 1200mm by 2000mm and offset from centre to be in line with the new garden path.  There will be one window to the west of the door 700mm by 1300mm and two windows equally spaced to the east 600mm by 130",
