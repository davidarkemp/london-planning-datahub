  "description": "We own the upper maisonette in the conversion in this property. Its residential and our primary home.The ground floor flat has a flat roof extension at the back of the property.\r\n\r\n4 of our windows at the back of the property are decaying and letting air in and need replacing, we understand this would require an application.\r\nWe want to use this opportunity to build a terrace on a part of our neighbour's extension. This would mean changing one of these windows into a door and add decking and ballustrades. As you can see on the attached plan, the terrace would be about 5.8 square meters. While it overlooks neighbours' gardens it doesn't allow more view than what we already have from other windows in our flat. We're also planning to use trellises as ballustrades to avoid taking light from no 14's garden.\r\n\r\nWe have the agreement of our downstairs neighbours with whom we own the lease. We can see terraces in other properties in the street (no 11 and 22 Ella road at least), these also have stairs to go into their garden. There are also terraces in neighbouring streets (e.g. Briston Grove 26-30).\r\nThe front facades of the properties in the street are locally listed but this work would happen in the back so we assume it wouldn't need any extra agreement.\r\n\r\nObviously we'll also need to get a structural engineer to look into the feasibility of the whole project, that hasn't happened yet.\r\n\r\nWe understand we would need to do a full application and any guidance would be welcome but we're wondering in particular:\r\n-\tDo we need to do separate applications for the windows and the terrace? (if the terrace is denied we still hope we can replace the windows)\r\n-\tIs it likely that we could fill the application successfully ourselves or do we need an architect?\r\n-\tAny thought on the gas boiler flue? We assume it may need to extended but don't know the regulations (it's currently 1m from the window so that side should be fine)\r\n-\tAny tips? What would be matter for this kind of appli",
