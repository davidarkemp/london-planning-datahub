  "description": "Property is an ex- council 1960s house, built in 1967. Sitting within a small housing estate at the edge of Islington, the estate is a combination of houses and low high rises, The estate is also on a hill as shown in the imagery ( B ) Our street is a combination of a terrace row which we sit within, as well as flats and a group of new 2\r\nstory council properties (C ). The houses and properties behind us sit higher than us due to the estate being on a hill. (D) We would add an extra level in a similar style to\r\nthe properties current simple style. We do not have plans, however have the original floor space tech drawing from when we bought the house in 2006 (E) . We would be looking to add x 2 bedrooms and 1 or 2 bathrooms . We need more space due our family size and working from home, and would prefer to add space to our home rather than move and incur the huge costs involved .\r\nWritten Advice (only): £286.00 + VAT = £343.20",
