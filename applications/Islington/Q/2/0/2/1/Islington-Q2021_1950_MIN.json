  "description": "Convert the basement level into a self-contained flat to generate rental income.\r\nAs part of this making the basement level self-contained, I would likely make the following changes:\r\n1)EXTERIOR (FRONT): Add a small exterior staircase that allows access to the basement level from the street level gate (consistent what many homes on this street have) (photo 1). The railing would be black wrought iron to match the ground level fence, and the steps would be wrought iron or another material deemed sympathetic to the house's Georgian architecture).\r\n2)INTERIOR: Add a small wall and door to separate the lower floor from the main level. The wall would be placed adjacent to the left banister of the stairway going down (i.e., the stairway between the main floor and basement level; photo 2). The door would be integrated within this wall, on the landing visible in the same photo. The upper incline of this wall would follow that of the stairs leading up to the first floor, and the wall would be covered in wood panelling to ensure aesthetic harmony with the house's period details.\r\n3)EXTERIOR (REAR): Replace the kitchen window with French doors (of the same total width; photo 3) and create a wrought iron exterior staircase that leads from these French doors to the garden below. (NB: a staircase from the first floor to the garden appears in a directly adjacent property, either 37 or 39 Noel Road.) NB: the plan is to make this staircase as discrete as possible, both in terms of its footprint, shape, and colour.\r\nAlong with these changes related to the basement conversation, we also would like to make a few minor changes to the interior, which include:\r\n4)Renovation of the existing bathroom between the main level and first floor (photo 4)\r\n5)Convert the rear-level bedroom into a full bathroom (currently it only contains a toilet and sink in the small dark cabinet visible in photo 5)\r\n6)Add wooden bookshelves on both sides of the fireplace in the living room (photo )\r\nSmall Scale Mi",
