  "description": "NHS Property Services (NHSPS) have been working on a coherent and informed approach to the future management of Finsbury Health Centre. As part of this approach NHSPS are prioritising the application of a waterproof coating to the existing roof structure, as phase 1 works.\r\nAt present, the roof areas to Finsbury Medical Centre are protected with an asphalt waterproofing, to which a solar-reflective paint coating has been applied. Two small areas of bituminous felt waterproofing are located to the rear aspect of the property. The existing waterproofing has deteriorated. There are visible indications of breakdown, and as such it can no longer be considered as an effective or reliable system.\r\nA 'SIKA' system is proposed to re-cover the flat roof to the building to ensure that it is water tight. The proposed solution is a simple, non-invasive system that will firstly entail the repair of the existing asphalt roof covering where it is damaged and will then cover the roof with a waterproof coating - similar in outcome, but more effective than that which is already there - such that it will not change the environmental conditions in any way from the existing situation. The new covering is vapour permeable and therefore moisture is able to emit and breathe through the coatings.\r\nThe proposals will 'tidy up' all joints and areas of weakness to ensure that existing leaks are prevented and new ones not possible/likely.\r\nAdditional information on the approach chosen is provided in the accompanying documents. \r\nNHSPS are also looking at a strategy for the long-term future of the building which includes other works to the building. We would be grateful for the opportunity to share these plans with you and hope that a collaborative approach to this strategy can be established between yourselves, Historic England and NHSPS. \r\n\r\nWritten Advice (only):£810.00 + VAT = £972.00",
