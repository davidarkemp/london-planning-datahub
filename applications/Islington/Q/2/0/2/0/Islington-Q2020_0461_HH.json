  "description": "We live on the top floor (third floor) of the building\r\nand would like to convert part of what is currently\r\na storage loft under the roof into a terrace.The existing property has a mansard roof with sloping roofs to the front and rear and a flat central section - the plan is to remove the sloping roof on the rear and half of the flat central section to make space for the terrace. The sloping roof on the front and the other half of the flat central section would remain exactly as they are, and the terrace would not take more space than what the current storage loft does on the rear. The stairs to access the new terrace area would be built within our current flat on the third floor and would be a continuation of the existing stairs that go from the second floor to the third floor (within our property) and in general a continuation of all the main stairs in the building.\r\n\r\nWritten Advice with Site Visit £465.00 + VAT = £558.00",
