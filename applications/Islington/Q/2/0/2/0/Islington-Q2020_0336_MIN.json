  "description": "Change of Use - We would like to obtain permission to change the use of the property from a dwelling house to an office. The house is owned by Alison Owen who is co-owner and director of Monumental Television Ltd and Monumental Pictures Ltd (a television production company and film production company respectively) and we would like to formally run these two businesses from this premises. This will not involve making any structural changes/development to the building, we are solely applying for change of usage. The usage will be light commercial - with approximately 8-10 members of staff conducting administrative duties only. There will not be a heavy flow of people/goods/deliveries in and out of the office and will have no impact on parking or any other residents of the street.\r\nWritten Advice with Site Visit: £1,184.00 + VAT = £1,420.80",
