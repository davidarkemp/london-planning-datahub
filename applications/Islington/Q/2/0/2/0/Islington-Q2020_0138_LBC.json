  "description": "We have recentlty purchased the property. \r\nOn the Ground floor of the building in the sitting room area the ceiling has been  wall papered with woodchip wallpaper by previous owners .  We do not know when this was completed but we suspect it was done in the 1970/80's.\r\n\r\nWe wish to replace this ceiling with a new ceiling to match the reception room ceiling (as it is one continuous room) and every other ceiling in the house .  It wouldn't be possible to remove the woodchip without ceiling replacement as  removal of the wooodchip would almost certainly  damage the ceiling  Picture atached shows the  ceiling and you will need to zoom in to see the woodchip .\r\n \r\nThe current  four manard dormer windows  are rotten and cannot be repaired and need replacement following our survey . As per the pictiures these windows were introduced when the mansard was bulit 30 years ago as we understand it . \r\n\r\nWe would introduce some sash windows to be more in keeping with the rest of street as the attached photo shows.\r\n\r\nWe attach a photo of the type of window which will be single glazed made from wood and pre-finished  white \r\nCharge for Written Advice with Site Visit: £611.00 + VAT = £733.20",
