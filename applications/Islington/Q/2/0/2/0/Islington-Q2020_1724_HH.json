  "description": "I want to replace the existing old roof extension with one that doesn't leak, is properly insulated, and is architecturally superior to the current structure.\r\n\r\nOver the last few years, I have submitted two previous planning applications P2018/2572/FUL and P2019/2575/FUL, both of which were rejected. The second application (which went to appeal) I though was a very sympathetic design which would improve the existing view of the structure. The extension would not have been seen from any street elevations or long views.\r\n\r\nI want to get some advice on what the council would be happy with, as the reasons given for refusal in my applications were quite generic.\r\n\r\nBroadly, the questions I have are broken down into 4 parts :\r\n\r\n1. The council seem to regard my current roof extension as unauthorised. There was a reference to this, and in the relevant history a listing for \"Unauthorised roof extensions\" E/2014/0066 in my second refusal. In this situation, will any planning applications for alterations be accepted, or will I just receive blanket refusals?\r\n\r\n2. The planning refusals seem to be down to adversely affecting the conservation area. In the decision notice it is (underscores are my emphasis) : \"The proposed roof extension, in terms of scale, massing and appearance, would represent an incongruous addition along this terrace of houses, which comprises a largely unaltered roofline, and would adversely affect the significance of the Arlington Square Conservation Area.\" The current, unlovely structure has been there for a long time, and I'm proposing to improve it without increasing visual the impact. I understand how a new structure could harm the conservation area, but I'm proposing to improve an existing rundown structure. Can you give me some more information about this? I'm really struggling to understand the reasoning, and I fear future applications will be refused if I can't get this straight.\r\n\r\n3.
