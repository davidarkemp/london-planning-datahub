  "description": "Redesign of the external spaces next to the rear elevation, on both ground floor and lower ground floor levels. The area affected is 3.7m deep by the whole width of the patio. The idea is to create an open mid level patio area with new steps to connect the lower ground floor with the big rear patio. To do this we need to remove the existing small balcony and remove the deck and all of the timber structure under it. This deck is not original of the building. It was never approved and it is in bad condition. The existing kitchen door to access the patio is also not original. We do not know if the existing balcony is original. There are no records of anything. We are proposing to change the existing metal black balcony with a small walk-on glass platform within a steel black structure in the sae style as the existing. Replace the existing deck with a new smaller decked area aligned with the kitchen and add a glazed veranda with a slim, black steel structure. The new glass step and deck will be at the same level as the existing balcony. The veranda will be a max of 3.7m at ridge level and about 2.5m. at eaves level next to the boundary brick wall with Number 14. Nothing can be seen from the street\r\n Written Advice with Site Visit: £611.00 + VAT = £733.20",
