  "description": "The property is a maisonette on the first and second floor with access to an unmodernised loft space above. It is accessed via the original walk up to the side extension.The proposal seeks to convert the existing loft space for habitable use. This will provide a valuable contribution to the need for the housing stock which can serve as family accommodation in the future.Works to the loft include the realignment of the side dormer and a new conservation rooflight to the rear. The former is necessary to create sufficient head height in the stairwell to access the loft where the existing staircase is currently non-compliant. Additionally, the existing roof will \r\nbe repaired, insulated and relined with slate tiles to match the original covering. The ridge height will be maintained in keeping with conservation guideline principles.\r\nThe design of the proposed side dormer retains the arched form of the existing dormer. It will be  lined with zinc to blend with the slate covering of the hipped roof. The rear conservation roof light will provide good daylighting to the loft space \r\nwithout visually detracting from the roof line.It is also proposed to construct a storm porch over the front door to the property, which is accessed via steps to the original raised entrance of the house. The design of the porch takes its cue from Victorian precedents of lightweight wrought iron structures, which will be read as a subservient element to the original built form.\r\nFollow-up Advice: £185.00 + VAT = £222.00",
