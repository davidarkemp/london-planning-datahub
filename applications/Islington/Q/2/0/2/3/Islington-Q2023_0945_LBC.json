  "description": "Ground floor: reinstating the opening between the front and rear rooms. This was closed following the Listed Building application in 2007. The blocked up section is non original modern construction. The partition could be reinstated in the future. The opening would not disturb the existing picture rail or decorative ceiling mouldings and structural and Building Control permission has been approved.\r\n2\r\nFirst floor: small rear extension, removal of existing plasterboard wc cubicles, which are later additions. This area would become a rear landing space with its two windows letting light into the hall areas. Again the 2 small toilets are a modern addition.\r\nFirst floor and second floor: removal of fire lobby entry to front and rear rooms, installation of door to front room from stair hall, formation of approximately 1200 wide ie double door width opening between front and rear rooms. The opening head would align to the underside of the existing picture rail which would not disturb the decorative ceiling mouldings and would maintain the architectural integrity of the two rooms. The fire lobby is a later addition and it is likely the door into the front room was originally off the hall\r\nWritten Advice with Site Visit: £611.00 + VAT = £733.20",
