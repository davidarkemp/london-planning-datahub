Despite previous repairs, water is leaking and damaging the walls, and also the ceiling of the bedroom below, where cracks are spreading. Photographs attached.Window replacement is needed urgently to prevent further damage to the fabric of the house and possible health and safety issues. \r\nPossible addition of secondary double glazing as also detailed to improve energy conservation in house. Neither of the above would have any effect on the external appearance of the building.Replacement of poor quality, damaged and poorly fitting and apparently non-original front door. Details in attached quote. We have attached a photograph of the doors on the terrace opposite which appear to be of original design. We would welcome any information, if known, about the original front doors of this terrace, and modify our plans as appropriate. \r\nWritten Advice (only): £425.00 + VAT = £510.00",
