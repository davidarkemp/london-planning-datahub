  "description": "The aim at the lower-ground floor is to enhance the usability of the kitchen, with new fittings and fixtures, new WC under the stairs to replace the existing WC, and addition of a guest suite that will make use of the existing lower-ground entrance. The existing WC beneath the stair is to be refurbished, with new fittings and fixtures. The existing conservatory extension is a recent addition, and will be replaced. The new structure is constructed with glass and maintains the same dimensions as the previous conservatory. It adheres to the guidelines and regulations of the conservation area, seamlessly integrating into the existing structure. The existing opening between the kitchen space and front room is to be filled in, with a new opening added adjacent to the parti, on the staircase side. The addition of a shower room and laundry room enhances the usability of the space, and does not create significant disruption to the plan-form, maintaining distinction between the front and back spaces. The ground floor is to be refurbished, and repaired, with particular attention paid to heritage assets. New joinery is proposed alongside the chimney breasts in both the front and rear rooms, remaining a minimum of 100mm beneath the ceiling in order to preserve the integrity and legibility of cornices. This joinery will in no way affect the existing casework in the front room. Similarly, to the ground floor, the first floor will see refurbishment of the original fabric, particularly in the street-facing room. Original shutters, window and door joinery, floorboards, and cornices are to be refurbished and replaced. The existing WC, to the rear of the house, has been significantly renovated and altered over the years. The proposal includes a complete refurbishment of existing bathroom, with new fittings and joinery. This bathroom is a modern addition, and does not hold any historic or architectural significance. Alterations to the upper internal level involves similar renovation and",
