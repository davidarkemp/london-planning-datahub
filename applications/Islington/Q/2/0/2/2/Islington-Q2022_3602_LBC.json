  "description": "Lower-Ground floor:-(i) Removal of the existing rudimentary conservatory structure, and replace it with a new structure that does not extend beyond the existing conservatory footprint.\r\n(ii) Widening of the the existing opening in the dividing wall within the basement, allowing the level to function as a single kitchen space.\r\n(iii) Renovation of the space beneath the staircase, allowing for storage space. The existing staircase itself is to be maintained and refurbished.\r\nGround Floor:-Refurbishment and restoration of existing fabric Addition of non-destructive, reversible joinery mounted onto walls.\r\nFirst Floor:-(i) Complete refurbishment of existing bathroom, with new fittings and joinery. This bathroom is a modern addition, and does not hold any historic or architectural significance.\r\n(ii) Removal of storage area above the existing bathroom - a recent addition to the building - in order to restore the full head-height within the space.\r\n(iii) Addition in the bedroom space along the Eastern wall, and alongside the fireplace and chimney breast.\r\nSecond Floor:-(i) The original plan-form has been entirely lost at this level. (ii) Addition of a bathroom in the South-West corner (iii) Addition of reversible, non-destructive joinery (iv) Removal of the existing modern staircase, likely added in the 1970s (v) Insertion of a new modern staircase and enclosing wall and balustrade\r\nRoof Terrace:-Removal of existing modern structure, to be replaced with a new structure in the same position as the existing structure. The roof extension will align with neighbouring roof extension, as well as the chimney stack of the original building in order to maintain a sense of appropriate scale, and enhance the aesthetic symmetry between the neighbouring houses.\r\nWritten Advice (only): £425.00 + VAT = £510.00",
