  "description": "The proposal seeks to provide 40+ new homes on a newly merged estate, comprising Aubert Court and Drakeley Court.  In addition to this a new community space is to be reprovided.  To facilitate the new development, which will be spread across 2 locations, demolition of the existing community centre, storage facilities and a two storey block comprising 10 x one bedroom units will need to take place.  The new community space will be sited in a more visible location where new homes will be provided above.  Improved outdoor facilities will also be provided for the existing residents at Drakeley Court.\r\n10th August 2022: 2nd review Â£3,300",
