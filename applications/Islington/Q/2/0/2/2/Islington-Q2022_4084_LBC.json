  "description": "The proposal is for the installation of 1 no. new gas riser to the basement lightwell with high level penetration into Flat 63a and low level penetration into Flat 63b, from here the riser will be routed internally. \r\nWritten Advice with Site Visit: £1,184.00 + VAT = £1,420.80\r\n\r\nThe gas riser will be painted white to match the basement lightwell render. Internally the riser will be boxed in and painted to match surface finishes.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is a direct result of an emergency gas-off, which has left two flats, including a vulnerable resident, without access to heating and cooking. \r\n\r\nCadent Gas are unable to reuse the existing internal route as it does not meet current Gas Industry standards, therefore, a new route is required. The existing internal riser contained within the fabric of the building and will be decommissioned and left in situ to minimise disturbance to the historic fabric of the building. \r\n\r\nIn particular I wanted to enquire as to whether any of the works, could be undertaken retrospectively ahead of the submission of the Planning & Listed Building Consent Application. \r\n\r\nHistoric England's Advice Note 16: Listed Building Consent does not specifically address Gas Infrastructure; however, it does address utility meter box installations and Heating and Domestic Hot and Cold Water Installations. \r\n\r\nThe Guidance states that LBC may not be needed where:-\r\n\r\nUtility meter boxes are usually located where practical for utility companies. If they, and any associated cables, can be located where there is little visual impact, the impact on special interest would be very low and thus there would be no need for LBC (P. 42). \r\n\r\nFor internal works, the Guidance states that Listed Building Consent may be needed:-\r\n\r\n(ii) Where pipework is to be re-routed internally or where completely new pipework is to be installed and this would involve cutting through historic fabric or creating unavoidably conspicuous surface-mounted piperuns, LBC may be needed, depend",
