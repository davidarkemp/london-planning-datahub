  "description": "1. The upper flat currently has a small balcony and guidance on getting permission for a full width balcony/raised garden is requested. It is noted that the next-door neighbour (No.31) has a very large extension with very large balcony but there is no record of planning approval on the Islington planning portal. The proposed balcony would be less than half the size of No.31. The other neighbour, No. 29, has a small single storey extension, no balcony. (plans attached) 2.If a full width balcony is unlikely to achieve planning permission, a two-storey extension will be considered - full width for the ground floor on the existing footprint, half width on the 1st floor. It would be preferable to have the 1st storey half width extension on the north-western boundary with no.31 to partially screen no.30 from the very large balcony. Is this likely to receive planning permission, there is already a two storey extension on the boundary between 31 and 32. (no plans developed to date)\r\nWritten Advice with Site Visit £465.00 + VAT = £558.00",
