  "description": "1. To amalgamate two properties into a single-family home. \r\n2. To create a basement and ground floor extension at the rear of the property, replacing an existing, poor quality, single storey extension. This will have the benefit of: a) Making the appearance of this part of the terrace much more consistent, see fig. 1 & 2. \r\n3. To relocate the kitchen from its current ground floor location to the basement. \r\n4. Reinstating the internal staircase This will have the benefit of: a) Reincorporating the basement flat back into a single dwelling house as originally built. \r\n5. To replace the existing front external metal staircase which requires repair with stone staircase of smaller dimensions, see fig. 5, 6 and 7. This will have the benefit of: a) Fitting in with neighbouring staircases at numbers 1, 12, 21, 23, 24, 28, 29, 37, 38, 47 and 48. b) Permitting bins to be stored at basement level, rather than impinging on the front of the terrace. \r\n6. Removal of the metal staircase accessing the rear garden, see fig. 3 & 4 This will have the benefits of: a) Improving the appearance of the rear of the building.\r\nb) Increasing the useable garden area /outdoor amenity associated with the house. \r\n7. To adjust the internal layout of the basement, following reinstatement of the internal staircase, including inserting a shower room /toilet between the front and rear rooms of the basement. This will have the benefit of: a) Replacing the facilities which will have to be removed to reinstate the internal staircase, so that occupiers/ guests would not need to go up two flights of stairs. \r\n8. To reinstate the two ground floor fireplaces. \r\n9. To recreate an opening between the two principle ground floor rooms. This will have the benefit of: a) reinstating the original opening. \r\n10. To alter the internal configuration of the first and second floor bathrooms. \r\n11. To rationalise the existing rwp to the rear elevation. \r\n12. No alterations are proposed to the existing roof. \r\n13. To r",
