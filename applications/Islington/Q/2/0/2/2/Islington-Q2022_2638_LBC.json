  "description": "This proposal supports an application to install secondary glazing to primary windows and ancillary doors & Internal Wall Insulation (IWI) primarily installed to front internal walls to all flats in the subject property 38/39 Sekforde Street EC1R 0HA a Grade II Listed building. To Install secondary glazing units to the internal face of all primary windows & some ancillary doors. Secondary glazing is a fully independent internal window system. The gap between the primary and secondary windows can vary but, in this case, the gap is 75mm. The aim of the secondary glazing is to significantly improve the thermal performance of this building. We propose to install secondary glazing to all primary windows in a house or flat excluding common windows. We propose to use using a slimline system that will mirror the fenestration of the existing window using spring balanced fully supported sliding sashes in all positions & single and double casements sliding sashes as required. Glazing varies from 4mm to 8.8mm thickness, with low emissivity or sealed glass units.\r\nFrame Colour Stock finish is white HIPCA 9910 semi-gloss or any standard powder paint, wood grain finish or anodised finish to match existing.\r\nIronmongery as required.\r\nFor the internal IWI we propose to use Mathilda's Blanket System an internal wall insulation system that is designed & retro fitted to internal fa√ßade walls, typically, but not limited to, solid wall or single skin building construction. Matilda's Blanket Panels are constructed using a six-part lamination of high-tech materials. With a sealed air gap between the wall and the panel, the system provides heat, sound and fire insulation. The panels are designed and built off site making each one specially tailored to fit the wall in that room, this is a fast product to install, especially where properties are in occupation. Installation consists of special dampers at the base and side of the panels, which are adjusted to lock the panels into position (in t",
