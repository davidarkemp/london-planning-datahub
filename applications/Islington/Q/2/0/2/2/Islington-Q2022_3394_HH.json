  "description": "The flat is currently a three bedroom maisonette split across the first and second floors of an end of terrace, victorian property. This application is for an extension to the flat to add a fourth bedroom and a small outdoor terrace in place of the current roof.\r\n\r\nThe current roof is a butterfly roof and would be replaced with a mansard roof to the front and a terrace/flat roof over the staircase to the back. The plans have been designed such that the extension cannot be seen from street level and would not impact neighbouring properties' privacy. The back of the property is not visible from the street and the buildings to the back of the property are primarily non-residential. There are a number of photos attached of the view from the back.\r\nThank you for reviewing our application, I have included all the documents I could think may be relevant but please don't hesitate to contact me for more information.If you are able to please provide any comments on the following it would be very helpful:\r\nDoes the privacy screen at the end of the terrace have to be wood or would a frosted glass screen be acceptable?\r\n?\tShould the extension not be permissible and there are no changes we can make to it to make it permissible, I have also included the plans we had drawn up for two other options (named OPTION B and OPTION C) and would really appreciate your input as to whether either of those would instead be a better approach. I understand this would not be a pre-application assessment but it would be very helpful to have an indicator of which approach to pursue.\r\nWritten Advice (only): £286.00 + VAT = £343.20",
