  "description": "Replacement and extension of existing rear balcony. The balcony is at ground floor level and extends north into the rear garden, which itself is in between ground and lower-ground level. The balcony does not currently allow for access to the garden. Garden access is currently only possible via the lower-ground bedroom directly below the balcony. The proposal is to remove the current balcony and replace it with a slightly wider one, adding approximately 200mm of depth. Three steps will also be added to the side of the new balcony on the west side to permit garden access from the ground floor. No other changes to the existing structures should be required. \r\nIn keeping with the current balcony and the balustrade along the shared flat-roof, materials will be painted black metal. The design will also be consistent with the current design, including plain vertical spindles and a slatted base to continue to allow light into the basement bedroom. A section post will need to be added under the balcony by the stair section to support the overall frame. The balcony will be fixed into the wall of the building using anchor bolts fixed by resin (in the same manner as the current balcony). The design is intended to be as close as possible to the historic fabric and design of the building, while significantly improving access between the building and the garden. I have discussed the proposals with the other tenants of 6 Barnsbury Street and they have no objections. \r\nWritten Advice (only): £425.00 + VAT = £510.00",
