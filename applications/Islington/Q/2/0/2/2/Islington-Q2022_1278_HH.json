  "description": "We would like to put solar panels onto the flat roof at the top of the property, in line with the Solar Together London proposal that we have received. We understand that these panels will, because it is a flat roof, have to be tilted up at an angle that will put them more than 200mm from the surface of the roof. We do not believe they will be (significantly) visible from the ground, as it is a four-storey building. The roof is currently not used for anything (other than two skylights).\r\nWritten Advice (only): £286.00 + VAT = £343.20",
