    "To comply with the provisions of Section 41(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. previously approved. 2. i) There is a need to check the projection of the canopy to the proposed building at the junction of Liverpool Road with the Culpeper link road as the drawing indicates that the canopy comes very close indeed to the kerb line and this must be at least half a metre back. ii) The colonade support to the Liverpool Road frontage is shown to be included within the public footway and this will need to be regularised in respect of two foundation areas. iii) In relation to the permanent Car Park frontage on the Culpeper Link Road the width of the access next to parking spaces 33 and 66 appears a little tight, particularly on the turns which could put cars in positions 33 and 66 at risk. iv) If there is to be a specific means of control over the permanent car park, it would be an advantage to know how this is to be effected. v) Safety measures are necessary to protect pedestrians in the walkway through the Car Park. (It is obviously a mistake but a car is shown on this walkway on one of the drawings). The same consideration will need to be applied to the service road. vi) If shopping trolleys are to be taken to the Car Park, there will need to be a definite way of getting them back to the store and this may identify the need for part of the Car Park to be allocated for customers to leave trolleys in. vii) Means of access to and from the temporary Car Park fronting the Culpeper Link Road are likely to cause conflict. At some time of the day vehicles will be using the service road, and drivers of large vehicles in the service road may not expect the Car Park facility to be joined with it. viii) Means of lighting for the car park and walkways need to be indicated."
