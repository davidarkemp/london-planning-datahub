    "the Council the statutory six weeks notice of your intention to do the work. You ought to have received a letter on the 5th March indicating that the Council had no objection, and I apologise for this not having been done. The problem was, as you will know, this Council's staff were on strike for the three week period including that week, including the arboricultural officer. I therefore now formally notify you that the Council has no objection to the proposals, to trim the tree by pruning not exceeding 20% reduction in order to reshape the tree. It is of course for you to obtain the necessary permissions of the owner of the tree. Once again I do apologise for not having let you know the position earlier."
