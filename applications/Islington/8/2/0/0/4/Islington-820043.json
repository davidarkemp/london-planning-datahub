    "formal observations regarding the above proposal. This Council has considered the proposal as detailed on the submitted drawings 889/237, 889/241-249, 251, 256-268, 889/270-279, 281-283, LBI Reg. 003176, and I have been instructed to inform you that this Council makes the following observations. 1. In principle it is accepted that new office developments be to preferred sites such as public transport interchanges. The principle of office development here is therefor not objectionable. However, it seems that most of the community facilities previously proposed in the outline scheme have been dropped. This loss is regrettable. 2. It is considered unfortunate that no industrial accommodation has been included within the scheme as a local employment benefit. The loss of the shops is also disappointing as the area in Islington adjacent to the development site is zoned as a shopping deficiency area in the Islington Development Plan. Given the increase in employees in the area the provision of shops would be desirable. 3. Although not regarded as a planning benefit as such, it is considered that provision should be made within the scheme for small and medium sized office suites (up to 1000 sq.ft. and 15,000 sq.ft.). This would to some extent relieve pressures for office development in areas of other uses."
