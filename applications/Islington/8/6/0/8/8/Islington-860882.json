    "That this Council raises objection to the proposal for the following reasons:- 1. The proposed development is contrary to the expressed employment policies of this Local Planning Authority and would result in the loss of employment opportunities for residents of this Borough; 2. The proposal, by reason of the absence of satisfactory off-street car parking accommodation would tend to create congestion and obstruction in Petherton Road and Leconfield Road thereby prejudicing the free flow of traffic and general safety."
