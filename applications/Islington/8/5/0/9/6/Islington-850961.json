    "This council objects to the proposal for the following reasons: i) The proposal represents, in this Councils view, a departure from the GLDP and is incompatible with the Islington Development Plan in terms of its compromising impact on both the Nags Head and Stroud Green Road shopping centres. It is also not consistent with the GLDP alterations ii) The impact assessments carried out by the developers consultants J. Trott and Son, consultant surveyors - do not provide a proper basis for evaluating the ramifications of the development on existing centres. iii) In this context the Council is concerned that the proposal could render the Nag`s Head development proposal not feasible and could have a serious effect on existing food shops at the Nag`s Head and on Stroud Green Road. iv) The Council does not object to a supermarket per se but is concerned about the impact of this proposal given the scale of the superstore and parking proposed."
