    "This Council considers the lattice and dish aerials would cause an unacceptable deterioration of the protected view of St.Pauls from Islington, as the lattice and aerials would compete visually with the dome and spire. The Council feels strongly that the present application should be refused. It is further considered that alternative location on the roof of Sudbury Tower would also be unacceptable, as the lattice and aerials would then be visible in front of the dome. The louvred screen would be barely visible from protected views in Islington, but as it is understood to be unnecessary to above existing plant it should also be omitted."
