    "This Council raises strong objection to the scheme for the following reasons: The proposal represents a gross overdevelopment of the site which will have an adverse effect on Islington. The area already suffers from serious parking problems and the proposed single coach bay plus 4 parking spaces fails to meet the standard of 3 coach bays and 2O car parking spaces in this Council's amended parking guidelines. The scheme will overshadow the proposed Ropemaker Place workers creche in Bridgewater Square and will result in the loss of a partly landscaped open area. It will cause loss of sunlight to buildings as far north as Cullum Welch House. The height of the building is excessive. In general the development will cause a serious reduction in residential amenity to residents living close to Fann Street."
