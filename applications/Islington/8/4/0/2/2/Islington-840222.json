    "This Council has no objections to this proposal but observes that visibility to the footway needs to be maintained through the proposed new vehicular access gates and school frontage railings in a north easterly direction to the proposed pedestrian access and for a distance of 2.5m in a south westerley direction. This would require the relocation of the school sign presently south-west of the proposed access."
