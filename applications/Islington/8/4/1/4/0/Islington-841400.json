    "Islington Council objects to the proposal. The proposed demolition and associated works which require Listed Building Consent are associated with a scheme which involves the closure of Raleigh Street. Islington Council has refused planning permission for this development on the grounds that such a scheme, prior to agreement on a permanent traffic management scheme for the area, is premature. In these circumstances, any demolition works are also considered premature, as, without an agreed development, such demolition will result in a derelict site within a Conservation Area."
