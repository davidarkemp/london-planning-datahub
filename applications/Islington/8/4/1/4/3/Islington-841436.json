    "That this Council welcomes the proposal to provide eleven workshop/ studio units, but that the Council consider that: i) it is essential that provision is made for a pedestrian walkway (internal or external) along the Battlebridge Basin side of the building ii) The demolition of the second floor on the Crinan Street elevation involves a destruction of the character of this locally listed building it is strongly suggested that proposals should be included to bring the second floor into use. iii) consideration should be given to the use of the basement to provide car parking with ramped access from the southern part of the building."
