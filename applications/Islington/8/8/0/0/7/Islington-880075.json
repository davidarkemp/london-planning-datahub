    "This Council considers that the car parking provision is far in excess of this Council's standards and the provisions of the Greater London Development Plan which seeks to restrain non-essential traffic, particularly on a site so close to a major public transport interchange. Furthermore, this Council suggests that; i) the developer demonstrate that speciality retailing on this scale does not have an adverse affect on existing shopping centres; ii) 'Speciality' shopping be defined by LB Camden and any permission or agreement be drawn up restricting the change of use to more traditional 'local' retailing; iii) the leisure facilities provided be available for use by local residents. iv) there is provision of a new/improved public pedestrian link between Kings Cross and St. Pancras Stations. Particular care is required in respect of design and management to ensure the safety and convenience of users. v) the developer agrees to fund a local recruitment and training programme to achieve maximisation of local recruitment, particularly from local disadvantaged groups."
