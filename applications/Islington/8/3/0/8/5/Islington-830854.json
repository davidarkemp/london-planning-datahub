    "Recommendation: The GLC be informed that this Council is not satisfied with the provision of a bedsitting unit, or with the proposed resiting of the rear extension as it considers that a flat with a separate bedroom would be a preferable form of residential provision, and the resiting of the rear extension breaks the existing pattern of paved rear extensions in this terrace to the detriment of daylighting to the rear ground floor rooms of 27 Davenant Road. The layout of the ground floor should be rearranged to take account of these views."
