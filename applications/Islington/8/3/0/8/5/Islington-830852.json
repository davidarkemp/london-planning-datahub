    "This Council finds the proposal unsatisfactory for the following reasons:- 1. The proposed roof extension is unacceptable in design terms. At present the street has a pleasant traditional character largely unspoilt because the roof line is unaltered and uninterrupted. The Council wishes to keep this character. The proposed extension will be the first in the street and will be prominent and obtrusive. 2. By adding two extra habitable rooms by means of this extension, the proposed scheme increases the density to nearly twice the figure accepted as the desired standard. The Council considers this increase excessive. 3. The proposed enlargement of the existing two storey extension , is considered excessive and detrimental to the amenity of the adjoining property."
