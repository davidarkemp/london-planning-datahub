    "The Council formally draws attention to its previously submitted views contained in a letter of 17th January 1983, namely:- (i) That access to the site should not be from Hatley Road in order that disturbance to the adjoining residential property is minimised. (ii) That the detailed treatment should be to a high standard of environmental quality. (iii) That the fencing and security arrangements are adequate. In addition my Council feel that the site should be made secure immediately and would draw your attention to the resolution of the Decentralisation Sub-Committee of Islington Council of 28th June 1983 which was to acquire this site as a potential Neighbourhood Office. In this last context Mr. Alan Blair of this Council's Valuation Department will contact your own Valuers in the immediate future."
