    "This Council makes the following observations: 'An identical application was submitted to this authority for the property, the greater part of which lies within this Borough. It is considered that the proposed extensions represent over development of the site by reason of over intensive use in general and excessive residential density in particular and that the extensions would have a detrimental effect on the character of the Charterhouse Square conservation area. This Council will seek substantial amendments to the form and extent of the extensions. the extension above no.43, which partly falls within the City boundary is considered particularly inappropriate."
