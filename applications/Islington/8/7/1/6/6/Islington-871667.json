    "This Council does not object in principle to the use of the site for car parking on a temporary basis provided it is for essential business users. Objection is, however, raised to the intended point of access on City Road which it is considered would be detrimental to free flow of traffic and to traffic and pedestrian safety. An alternative access on Shepperdess Walk at the northern end well away from the junction should be sought."
