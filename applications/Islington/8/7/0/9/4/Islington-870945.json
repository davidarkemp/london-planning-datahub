    "'This Council's policy in its adjoining Conservation Area No. 4 is to refuse permission for full roof extensions except in 5 identified terraces, these being 41-69 (odd) and 48-60 (even) Linton Street, 1-19 (odd) and 2-16 (even) Rees Street and 2-13 (consec.) Rydon Street. These terraces were identified on the basis that a number of the properties in them already had roof extensions at the time the policy was adopted. Elsewhere the policy is only to allow set back roof extensions not visible from any street level view: 49-83 Arlington Avenue are identified as being a terrace where such set-back extensions would be accepted. Elsewhere no roof extensions of any kind are permitted. The Council therefore feels that despite the existence of other roof extensions in the terrace it would not be appropriate to permit a full roof extension on this property, and requests that planning permission and listed building consent be refused.'"
