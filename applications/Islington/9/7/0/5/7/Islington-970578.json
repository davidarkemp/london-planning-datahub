    "CONDITION: The development permitted shall be begun not later than the expiration of six months from date of this permission. \r\n\r\n REASON: The unit is part of a protected shopping frontage where the proportion of non-retail units is close to the maximum proportion usually considered appropriate by the shopping policy. In the shopping frontage there are some unimplemented and recently expired permission for non-retail units and the Council wishes to ensure that overall the proportion of non-retail units is regulated to be broadly compatible with its shopping policies. A short implementation will ensure that there is not an unacceptable build up of potential non-retail uses which could be implemented."
