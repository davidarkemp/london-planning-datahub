    "1. The proposal would have a significant visual impact on Islington. The extent of the increase in height and scale of the tower is not justified. Of particular concern is the likely affect on views from nearby, including those from the Finsbury Square and Bunhill Row. The proposal will also infringe the backdrop to the view of St.Pauls from Westminster Pier."
