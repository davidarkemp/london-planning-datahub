  "description": "Camden Council has received a planning application seeking to renew the planning permission for the mixed wine bar and club use of arches 26-31A (known as The Cross). Camden have asked Islington Council for its comments on the application. As you may be aware, the previous permission was granted for a limited period only. In deciding whether to renew it now, Camden's Planning Committee will take into account any comment which it receives. These can be made via us or directly to Camden Planning Department. You may find it helpful to contact the person in Camden Planning Department who is dealing with the application. His name is Ed Watson and he can be contacted on 278 4444 ext. 2682. Knowing the views of people in the parts of Islington nearest to the club premises will however help Islington Council to decide exactly what comments to make to Camden.",
