    "(1) The proposal represents a sustainable and economic use of land and is in an accessible location, although it fails to provide adequate benefits to the wider area including social housing, environmental benefits and infrastructure improvements. \r\n\r\n (2) The effect of the proposal in visual terms on the London Borough of Islington is negligible. However, extreme concern is expressed about the justification for and effect of a building which is radically out of scale and characater with surrounding buildings and streets. Of particular concern is the effect at the immediate local level and on historic landmarks and townscapes such as the Tower of London and the Royal Exchange and on views from the Thames and the eastern City fringes when the proposed tower would be seen in isolation."
