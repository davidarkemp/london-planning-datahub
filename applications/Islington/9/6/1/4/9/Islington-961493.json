  "description": "Camden Council has received a planning application seeking planning permission to extend the existing wine bar and club use in arches 26-31A (known as The Cross) into the adjoining railway arches 31B and 31C and into the remainder of arch 31A.  Camden have asked Islington Council for its comments on the application. As you may be aware, the previous permission was granted for a limited period only and there is now a separate application to renew it (96/1518).  In deciding whether to permit the extension of the premises now, Camden's Planning Committee will take into account any comments which it receives.  These can either be made via us or directly to Camden Planning Department. You may find it helpful to contact the person in Camden Planning Department who is dealing with the application. His name is Ed Watson and he can be contacted on 278 4444 extension 2682. Knowing the views of people in the parts of Islington nearest to the club premises will, however help Islington Council to decide exactly what comments to make to Camden.",
