We would however be grateful if in future you kindly allowed us a more realistic time, perhaps 28 days, in which to give observations. Should we consider in this particular case that there would be implications for our Borough, with our perhaps needing to make consultations of our own, it would be very difficult if not impossible for us to reply within fourteen days. This will be the more so when there are, as occurred in this case, several days lapse of time between your date of letter and when we actually receive it.'"
