    "This Council advises that:- \r\n\r\n Achieving the removal of the 'temporary' concourse and reinstating the front facade of Kings Cross Station would be a significant and much needed symbol of change at Kings Cross. It is very unfortunate therefore, that finding a solution to problems/oppourtunites surrounding the station was knocked off course by earlier uncertainties over the CTRL. Islington supports the early removal of the concourse, linked to re-provision of facilities within the station, and looks to Camden to be firm in its negotiations with Railtrack. To this end, Islington does not object to a further 3 year period but would suggest that Railtrack be told that this is the last extension they are likely to receive and that Railtrack should be in a position to implement an agreed replacement within the 3 year period with or without the CTRL."
