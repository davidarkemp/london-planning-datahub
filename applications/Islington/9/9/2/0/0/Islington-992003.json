    "This is a major development with a frontage on the canal which will have a considerable impact on the Arlington Square Conservation Area within LBI and canal towpath within LBI. The details proposed are inadequate to fully access the impact. The canal elevation needs articulation and clarification of materials. The overall scale appears domineering. Details are essential prior to considering whether your Council should approve the scheme. Please send any futher details of this matter to LBI. Please also note that 47a Arlington Avenue which fronts onto the canal has planning permission for residential."
