The Council would object to the proposal if it involves any new vehicular access from York Way opposite the junction with Copenhagen Street, but has no objections to the proposal if the main vehicular access is on Goods Way as existing. \r\n\r\n (2) The existing boundary wall and railings along York Way should be retained. \r\n\r\n (3) Subject to (1) above being acceptable, London Borough of Islington would prefer a less obtrusive and simpler advertising sign."
