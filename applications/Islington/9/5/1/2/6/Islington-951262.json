    "That the London Borough of Camden be informed that this Council wishes to raise no objection to the principle of the use nor to the physical alterations and associated part demolition. The Council would however urge that conditions be imposed on any permission granted seeking to minimise the impact of the proposed club use on the amenity of residents. These should include:- \r\n\r\n i) a condition requiring attenuation of noise arising from the operation so that the sound emitted is at a level in keeping with the prevailing ambient noise level; \r\n\r\n ii) a condition restricting operation of the dub to specific days of the week; \r\n\r\n iii) a requirement for the applicants to provide for a reasonable level of parking on land within the Goods Yard area. \r\n\r\n The parking provision, and arrangements for stewarding the area to encourage patrons leaving the premises to disperse quickly and quietly, should be subject to a Section 106 planning agreement."
