    "That the London Borough of Haringey be informed that this Council has no objections to the proposal but that consideration should be given to the following observations: - 1. It is considered that the parking arrangement as shown on the plans (152/P05 and 1152/P03) is unsatisfactory. The proposed parking arrangement is harzardous and probably unworkable. It would be more satisfactory to close up the Hornsey Lane access and open up an access off Tile Kiln Lane where two car spaces are proposed. This would allow different parking arrangements with more vehicles away from housing, and vehicle manoeuvre easier. 2. The lower ground floor plan (152/P05) shows Flat 1 and House 4 sharing a common space. This would cause direct overlooking into bedroom 2 of House 4 and seriously affect their amenity. The position of windows and garden area should be revised."
