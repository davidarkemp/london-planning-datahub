  "description": "Camden Council has received a planning application seeking permission for the dance club use in part of Bagley's warehouse. Camden has asked Islington Council for its comments on the application. Camden's Planning Committee will take Islington Council's comments into account when they decide whether to approve or refuse the application. They will still have the option  should they decide to approve the application  of imposing conditions designed to influence the way in which it operates. You may find it helpful to contact the person at Camden Planning who is dealing with the application. His name is Greg Dowden and he can be contacted on 071 278 4444 Extn.2624. Knowing the views of people in the parts of Islington nearest to the club premises will however help Islington Council decide exactly what comments to make to Camden.",
