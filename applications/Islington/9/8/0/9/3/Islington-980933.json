    "No objections are raised to the principle of the proposed development. Please note however the following comments: \r\n\r\n 1. The ground floors are proposed as the work element of the units, therefore, there should be a greater visual and practical distinction from the upper floors. Window cills could be lowered to 1m above pavement level and 2 large windows created out of the proposed 4. \r\n\r\n 2. The live/work units appear more like residential units and do not seem to meet live/work standards. The work area should be capable of accommodating the full range of B1 uses. The entrance doors should be significantly larger than domestic scale, and possibly double doors. The entrance to the 3 storey block should be near or in the vehicle access way for servicing purposes. \r\n\r\n 3. Vehicle bays for the live/work units should be dedicated. \r\n\r\n 4. Adequately sized refuse storage should be provided within distances from the main road prescribed by the Council's refuse service as it would appear the vehicle access head height is too low for a refuse vehicle nor would there be sufficient turning space within the site."
