    "THIS COUNCIL SUBMITS THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS: The proposed development is considered to be inappropriate in relation to the adjacent Arlington Square Conservation Area by reason of its design and bulk. It fails to properly offset the features of the neighbouring 1840's residential terrace, which is an essential element of the character of the conservation area. The treatment of the roof extension in particular clearly undermines the overall character of the area, it is bulky and does not reflect the architectural detail of the adjoining cottages. This Council also objects to the implied loss of residential accommodation which is contrary to the Strategic Guidance for London and would further exacerbate the shortage of such accommodation in London."
