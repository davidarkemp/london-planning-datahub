    "THIS COUNCIL MAKES THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS: In principle, this Council would positively welcome the redevelopment of a site which, in our opinion, severely undermines the visual amenity of the area. Notably, the redevelopment affords the opportunity to offset what this Council considers to be an attractive office development on the opposite side of City Road. In the current economic climate and considering the general lack of demand for manufacturing floorspace we do not consider the preservation of the industrial buildings to have a strategic implication. This Council does not consider the scheme to have any further implications for the London Borough of Islington and I trust these observations will assist you in the consideration of the application."
