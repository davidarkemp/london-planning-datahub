    "The proposal is to remove a mature Lime tree growing in the rear garden of 54-55 Myddelton Square, EC1R 1YA. . The tree is visible from Milne Street and from the rear of the properties at Claremont Close and Myddelton Square where it contributes greatly to the environmental amenity of the locality. It is a healthy tree of good form and vigour and it is felt that its protection would be of long term benefit to the conservation area.\r\nThe tree is alleged to have caused direct damage to the rear boundary wall to the extent that the wall is now dangerous. Approval has previously been granted for the removal of two trees that were deemed to have caused direct damage to the wall in this area and it is felt that the application for the removal of the Lime tree is to ease the building of the replacement wall without any proof provided that the Lime tree is wholly or partially responsible for the initial damage.  This Tree Preservation Order will ensure that when the wall is replaced it will be done with an engineered solution that can ensure the retention of this important amenity tree.  \r\n\r\nThe application to fell the tree has been refused for two equal and unconnected reasons (i) on the basis of loss of a visual amenity and (ii) on the basis that you have failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that it is necessary to remove the tree to facilitate the rebuilding of the wall. \r\n \r\nThere is a right to appeal this decision. Should you do intend to do this it is advised that you should consider providing further evidence to the Local Authority, prior to making your appeal, to enable the Council to consider further information and make an informed decision. If you consider that the tree is causing an actionable nuisance I would advise that you seek a declaration from the High Court that this is the case. \r\n \r\nFailure to appeal this decision or to make an application to the High Court will mean that you have wholly failed to mitigate your loss and the Council reserves the right to defend any claim that you may bring for compensation relating to the tree. \r\n \r\nIf further clarification is required in regards to the detailed nature of the information required, please contact the Local Authority to discuss this."
