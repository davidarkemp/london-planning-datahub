    "The application to fell the tree has been refused for two equal and unconnected reasons (i) on the basis of loss of a visual amenity and (ii) on the basis that you have failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that it is necessary to remove the tree. \r\n \r\nThere is a right to appeal this decision. Should you do intend to do this it is advised that you should consider providing further evidence to the Local Authority, prior to making your appeal, to enable the Council to consider further information and make an informed decision. If you consider that the tree is causing an actionable nuisance I would advise that you seek a declaration from the High Court that this is the case. \r\n \r\nFailure to appeal this decision or to make an application to the High Court will mean that you have wholly failed to mitigate your loss and the Council reserves the right to defend any claim that you may bring for compensation relating to the tree. \r\n \r\nIf further clarification is required in regards to the detailed nature of the information required, please contact the Local Authority to discuss this."
