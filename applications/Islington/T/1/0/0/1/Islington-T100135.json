    "A previous notification to remove this tree was received (T090386) in 2009, this notification was withdrawn and a Tree Preservation Order imposed on the tree to protect it from removal. No further reason or evidence has been submitted to support the application to fell the tree and as neither the situation nor the health of the tree has changed this application is refused for the same reasons  the TPO was imposed:\r\n  (i) On the basis of loss of a visual amenity and \r\n(ii) on the basis that the agent failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree is causing any damage to property as alleged or at all. \r\n \r\nThere is a right to appeal this decision. Should you do intend to do this it is advised that you should consider providing further evidence to the Local Authority, prior to making your appeal, to enable the Council to consider further information and make an informed decision. If you consider that the tree is causing an actionable nuisance I would advise that you seek a declaration from the High Court that this is the case. \r\n \r\nFailure to appeal this decision or to make an application to the High Court will mean that you have wholly failed to mitigate your loss and the Council reserves the right to defend any claim that you may bring for compensation relating to the tree. \r\n \r\nIf further clarification is required in regards to the detailed nature of the information required, please contact the Local Authority to discuss this."
