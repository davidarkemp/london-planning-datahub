    "The original application has been lessened from felling to a 30% crown reduction. This is following discussion on site that if sufficient evidence had not been received to implicate the tree as the primary agent of the damage to the wall and that all other engineering solutions have not been examined then the council would not be able to determine whether the tree should be removed. The evidence has not been provided, this is mainly due to the fact that the agreed excavations to discover the level of rooting activity behind the wall have not yet been completed. The approval for a crown reduction will allow the remedial works to reduce the sail area of the tree should it be needed after the removal of the retaining wall."
