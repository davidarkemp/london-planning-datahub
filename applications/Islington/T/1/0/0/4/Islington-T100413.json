    "There is a legal duty to plant a replacement tree when a TPO tree is removed.  In this instance, the agent has suggested  three replacement trees. These trees are to be planted as close as practicable to the location of the original tree by the end of the first planting season following its removal.  The trees should be a standard with a minimum girth of 12-14cm .\r\n\r\nThe replacement tree will automatically be protected by the existing Tree Preservation Order and I would be grateful if you could let me know when it is planted, with details of species and exact location  in order that I may amend my records accordingly."
