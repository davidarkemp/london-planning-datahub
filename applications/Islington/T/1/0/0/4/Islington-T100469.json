    "The proposed tree pruning works have been lessened following negotiation with the agent.\r\nThe eastern tree work specification for the tree adjacent to the bin stores has been reduced from a reduction and thin to a crown thin and lift following negotiation with the agent. Due to the leaf miner infestation and bursting bark canker it is inappropriate to place trees of this species on a biannual cycle as this will add to the depletion of he trees reserves and be detrimental to the long term health of the tree. It is envisioned that the planning department would look favourably on this tree being pruned on a 3-4 year cycle.\r\nThe central tree is of apparent good health and vigour. This tree has a pronounced lean to the east having been suppressed by neighbouring tree, which was removed in 2009. The works proposed have also been amended following negotiation with the agent to the lesser works of a 20% thin while retaining the proposed reduction of 20-25%. The works are appropriate to address the balance of the tree, and it is agreed that the western side will be left unpruned."
