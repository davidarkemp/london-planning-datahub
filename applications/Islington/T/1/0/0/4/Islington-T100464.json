It is strongly advised that the written permission of the tree owner be obtained prior to any works to the tree that do not overhang the boundary of the rear garden of 60 Brooksby Street.  This is  a civil matter for the two parties to address, should this matter not be resolved within the next two years, notification would need to re submitted to the authority."
