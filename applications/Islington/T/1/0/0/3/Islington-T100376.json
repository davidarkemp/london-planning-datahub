    "While the notification of intent to remove these trees has been permitted ( not been refused) by the local authority, the removal of the trees is a civil matter between the applicant and the tree owner. It is not for the council to determine whether these trees are a problem, it is for the authority to determine whether a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) should be made to avoid their removal from the conservation area. This decision has been made on whether it is expedient in the interests of amenity to protect the trees by the imposition of a TPO. While these trees do have merit, they are not currently worthy of the imposition of a TPO. This now remains a civil matter for the two parties to address, should this matter not be resolved within the next two years, notification would need to re submitted to the authority."
