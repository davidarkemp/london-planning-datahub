    "While approval has been granted for the crown reduction of these trees, this does not imply that the council have received the level of evidence to implicate these trees either partially or wholly as contributing factors to the alleged subsidence damage at 4 John Spencer Square. These trees have historically been pruned at these points and the repeat of those works previously approved should not be detrimental to the long term health or the form of the trees.\r\nThe continued level monitoring is expected to establish any reaction to the pruning works but it is strongly recommended that the ivy on trees and the other significant shrubby vegetation in the area be removed as this leaf area will have a major affect on the vegetative water uptake in the immediate location of the damage and its removal is preferable to the loss of valuable amenity trees."
