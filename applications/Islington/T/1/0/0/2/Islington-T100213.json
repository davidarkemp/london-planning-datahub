    "While the council may grant approval for the works as notified, the tree owners permission must be obtained prior to any works to the tree. This tree is managed by Greenspace on behalf of Homes for Islington, therefore permission must be obtained from both prior to any works (contact James.Chambers@Islington.gov). The council do not TPO their own trees or trees they manage which is probably why this tree was not protected during the TPO review of 2007 when many other trees in the locality were protected. If the tree where not to be managed by Islington council in the future then it would be worthy of protection by a Tree Preservation Order due to its amenity value.  It is unlikely that Greenspace will allow the removal of mature, healthy trees within a conservation area."
