  "description": "Rear Garden Mimosa - Aprox. 14m - Fell to ground level - Reasons - This fast growing species is inappropriate for its location. It continually has occurrences of limb failure and break out. It has poor crown structure and several included unions. The tree owner is happy to re-plant a more suitable (possibly British native) specimen in the garden which would be more in keeping with the character of the conservation area. 2 x Birch - Raise overhanging crown by 1.5m to abate nuisance and as general maintenance.",
