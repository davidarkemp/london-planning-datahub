    "It is recommended that the adjacent Lime trees are crown reduced and the ground cover vegetation adjacent to the main area of damage is removed, this will help to reduce the water demand in the locality. It is also recommended that continued monitoring is carried out to establish the effects of the works. The Council would look favourabley on an application to crown reduce T4 and T5 of HOLLOWAY (NO.3) TPO 1976 to the last previous points of reduction, to crown lift to 6m and to thin the remainder of the crown by up to 20%."
