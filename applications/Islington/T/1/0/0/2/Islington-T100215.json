    "The application to fell T9 has been REFUSED. \r\n\r\nThe reasons given within the application and discussed at the pre application site visit to remove T9:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe tree is an inappropriate species for its location.\r\nIn central London we are fortunate enough to have a wide diversity of species planted including many considered exotics in other parts of the country.  \r\nThe size of the tree is not out of keeping with the surroundings and the trees along this rear boundary provide important screening between the rear elevations of Alwyne place and Willow Bridge Road. Indeed it is ideally situated at the rear boundary of the garden approximately equidistant from the properties \r\nWe would not consider the tree to be of an inappropriate species for its location and the loss of this tree would have a detrimental impact on the Conservation Area.\r\nThis tree contributes materially to the amenity of the locality and to the character of the conservation area, playing an important part in providing a sense of scale, maturity and textural diversity to the immediate vicinity. It is an important visual asset along the rear garden scene and provides a unique feature of the area with the colour and texture of the foliage contrasting with the neighbouring trees. \r\n\r\n2.\tThere is foreseeable direct damage to the rear boundary wall.\r\nNo evidence of current damage has been submitted, the perceived threat of future damage while given some weight could be applied to almost all the trees in central London and is not accepted as an appropriate cause for removal. The gardens in this area of Canonbury are generally on made ground with a subsoil of River Terrace. There are larger trees in the Borough that co-exist closer to boundary walls without causing damage, the removal of this tree is believed to be premature and unnecessary. There is no evidence provided to say that the wall is any more pre-disposed to failure due to its proximity to the tree.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe maintenance costs associated with the maintenance of this tree.\r\nThe normal maintenance costs of the pruning of trees in an acceptable element of owning a property with a garden in this area.\r\nIf the tree is regularly inspected there is no set requirement to prune other than the needs of maintaining the tree in a healthy state.\r\n\r\nThe council would give favourable consideration to some pruning works to T9 in line with good arboricultural practice if a new application were to be received."
