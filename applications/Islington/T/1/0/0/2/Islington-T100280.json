    "The Lime trees have rather dense narrow crowns growing as lapsed pollards. The trees have been heavily thinned in the past leaving them a flag– poled form with the majority of the growth on the tips at the top of the canopy. While generally resistant to reducing mature trees I feel in this instance a careful reduction, without a thinning will allow the trees to achieve a smaller but balanced form while retaining the lower screening. It is envisioned that the trees be thinned in the next cycle of maintenance and that alternate crown reduction and crown thinning works on a 3 year cycle would be the best way to manage these important amenity trees."
