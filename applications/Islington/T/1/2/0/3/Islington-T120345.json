  "description": "1 x Lime Tree (T114) in the rear garden of 59 Gibson Square, London N1 0RA The tree needs to be reduced by 25% (concentrating more on the lower and mid-height lateral branches), and thinned by about 15%. Also the epicormic (sucker) growth on the main stem to the crown break needs to be removed. The tree has received various surgery in the past, the most recent of which was performed in Spring 2008 (Application T080063). This is a mature specimen of good vigour which has put on significant re-growth since the work undertaken in 2008. This application is repeat surgery to reduce the tree to its former density and to maintain a maximum clearance of 3m to the adjacent property.",
