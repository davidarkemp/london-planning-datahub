  "description": "Tree works in a Conservation Area.\r\nWorks:\r\nRear garden - Cherry - Fell.\r\nThere is a cherry tree in the small rear garden at 27 Ripplevale Grove.  Planning permission and listed building consent have been obtained to build an extension to the existing property with consquent landscaping which involves a stepped garden from the LGF to the upper level of the garden on which the tree is growing.  The tree is right on the edge of the new stepped garden and the excavation work required has removed some of the tree's roots (see plan and photographs attached).  The tree does not look healthy and its current position is very perilous.  Permission is sought to remove the tree straightaway and replace it with a developed crab apple positioned towards the rear of the garden.",
