  "description": "Works:-\r\nRear Garden\r\nLiquid Amber - Approximately 8m. Fell to ground level as it has reached an inappropriate size for a town garden. Client wishes to replace tree with a more suitable specimen tree, possibly a magnolia. Cherry - Located on rear boundary. This tree appears in good health and provides valuable screen for both tree owners and neighboring property. As part of the treeâ€™s ongoing maintenance schedule we would like to reduce crown by 20-25%, thin crown density by 20% preserving low branch structure for continuity of screen and remove dead wood. Birch - This tree is in fine condition. We are very aware that birch trees do not respond well to heavy pruning and make the following request because of the trees proximity to buildings and because our client has received concerns with regards to subsidence. We would like to reduce the crown by 25% being as sympathetic as possible in order to preserve trees health whilst helping to curtail sphere of influence.",
