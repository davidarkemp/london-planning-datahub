  "description": "Horse Chestnut in front garden is dying and branches now falling into both our garden and our neighbours. Tree has been in poor condition for a number of years and we have monitored it in the hope it might recover. This year however it is clearly dying and we wish to remove it to avoid any danger to us and our neighbours. We propose to replace it approximately 1.5m to the right of the existing location with a Silver Birch or a species recommended by LBI.",

    "A tree must be planted to replace the Horse Chestnut permitted for removal.\r\nA silver birch is not a sufficient replacement and the council expects to see a replacement chosen from the following list:\r\n  Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa); \r\n  Tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera); or \r\n  Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua).\r\n\r\nThe location of the replacement should be slightly further away from the property along the boundary wall, about 2m to the south side of the existing stem to prevent suppression from the adjacent Plane trees.\r\nthe tree is required to a standard of a minimum girth of 16 - 18 cm at 1.5m above ground level. It must be planted within one growing season of the Horse Chestnuts removal.\r\n\r\nThe replacement tree will be automatically protected by the existing TPO. Please contact the tree officer when the tree is planted so that the TPO records may be updated."
