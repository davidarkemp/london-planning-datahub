  "description": "Statement of Reasons for Tree Preservation Order Application To fell three Plane trees in the rear garden of 25 Richmond Crescent: to ground level and treat the stumps with an appropriate herbicide Tree Preservation Order Reference: 396 2008 1. The above tree works are proposed as a remedy to the differential foundation movement at the insured property and to ensure the long-term stability of the building. 2. The above tree works are proposed to limit the extent and need for expensive and disruptive engineering repair works at the insured property. The estimated repair costs are likely to vary depending upon whether the trees can be removed or have to remain. 3. The above tree works are proposed to limit the duration of any claim period and therefore allow the landowner their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property. 4. It is the case that an alternative to felling such as pruning or significant ‘pollarding’ of the tree would not provide a reliable or sustainable remedy to the subsidence in this case. We do not consider that any other potential means of mitigation, including root barriers, would be effective or appropriate in the circumstances.",
