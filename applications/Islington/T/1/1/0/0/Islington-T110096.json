    "The specimen is a mature Sycamore located adjacent to the rear boundary of the property. The tree is of poor health, vigour and form having a large amount of decay in the main stem. The structural defects make the drastic option of a 50% reduction the only prudent option other than removal. In order to provide tree cover this tree is to be retained until such time as a replacement tree has established in the same locality."
