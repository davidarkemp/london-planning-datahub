    "The application to fell the tree has been refused for two equal and unconnected reasons (i) on the basis of loss of a visual amenity and (ii) on the basis that you have failed to supply any arboricultural justification to satisfy the Council that the tree is should be removed. \r\n \r\nThe reasons given on the application to remove T13 are:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe tree will eventually die.\r\nA large limb has been removed to facilitate the rebuilding of the rear boundary wall, removing the encroachment into alley way which is a fire escape. The creation of a large wound at the base of a tree is usually not appropriate practise and it may lead to the ingress of fungal decay and structural defects which could foreshorten the trees normal lifespan. How ever the tree may still has a useful life expectancy of decades. All trees may be said to be dying and that a tree will die eventually is not reason to remove a TPO’d tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Ash is getting in the way of a recently planted Robinia.\r\nWhile the planting of a tree as a prospective replacement for an existing tree is to be applauded, the Robinia should have been planted sufficiently far enough from the Ash so as not to become suppressed. The replacement tree should be moved and/or there may be some scope for the pruning of the Ash to reduce its influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loss of this tree would have a detrimental impact on the Conservation Area. This tree contributes materially to the amenity of the locality and to the character of the conservation area, playing an important part in providing a sense of scale, maturity and textural diversity to the immediate vicinity. It is an important visual asset along the rear garden scene and provides a unique feature of the area with the colour and texture of the foliage contrasting with the otherwise.   \r\n\r\nGiven the valuable environmental amenity of this tree and the limited supporting evidence provided,  the authority is unable to permit the application for removal and as such the refusal of permission is the only possible option at this point in time until further factual evidence is provided.  The authority is willing to discuss the provision of further evidence to support the case for removal of the tree and any other remedial options."
