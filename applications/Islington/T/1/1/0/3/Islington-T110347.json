    "The application to fell the tree has been refused for two equal and unconnected reasons (i) on the basis of loss of a visual amenity and (ii) on the basis that you have failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree is causing any damage as alleged. \r\n\r\nGiven the  proximity of the Sycamore tree in the rear garden of 31 Gibson Square to the main area of building movement ( point 5 on the level monitoring submitted), which has been permitted for removal ( T110350) the council believe it is reasonable to determine that it is this tree that would exert a greater effect on the building. \r\nThe lesser works of a 40% reduction have been permitted. The council beleive that this substantial reduction, along with the tree removal at 31 Gibson Square is a reasonable approach considering the relative minor level of damage (BRE 2) and the property distance from the trees."
