    "The council expects to see x5 trees planted to replace the Sycamores on the rear boundary. Two of the trees are to be specimen trees that will be of a species that will ultimately attain a large size. The remainder will be of a species that will achieve medium sized canopies. The replacement trees will be planted in similar location but further from the rear boundary. The species selection is to be agreed with the tree officer prior to planting in the first planting season after the removal of the trees. The size of the two specimen trees should not be less than 20 - 25 cm girth at 1.5m above ground level and the smaller replacement trees no less than 16- 18 cm girth at 1.5m above ground level."
