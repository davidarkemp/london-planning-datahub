    "The specimen is a mature Beech tree located adjacent to the front boundary of the property.  The tree forms part of a linear feature of mature trees along this section of Canonbury Park North.  \r\n\r\nThis tree contributes materially to the amenity of the locality and to the character of the conservation area, playing an important part in providing a sense of scale, maturity and textural diversity to the immediate vicinity. It is an important visual asset along the street scene and is a feature of the area.\r\nThe tree (T16) is of apparent good health and vigour and has been pruned in the past to prevent encroachment towards the property and lifted to allow light to the front garden. \r\n\r\nThe application to prune the tree has been refused for two reasons (1) on the basis of loss of a visual amenity and (2) on the basis that you have failed to supply valid arboricultural reason to justify the pruning as specified.  \r\n\r\n1.\tThe crown reduction of this tree would have a detrimental impact on the amenity value of the tree and its contribution to the Conservation Area. \r\nLarge trees provide greater benefits both environmentally and for amenity, we will generally allow trees to attain their full crown potential where possible. I believe that these trees could attain a larger size without the need for crown reduction.  \r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tNeither of the reasons given on the application valid arboricultural reasons to justify the level pruning as specified:\r\n \r\nGeneral Maintenance.\r\nThe crown reduction of a tree is not usually described as general maintenance. General maintenance is usually specified as works to abate the nuisance of encroachment to property, footpaths, highways etc.\r\nT15 has a crown that is currently balanced and of good form, the proposed crown reduction of this tree would include the removal of a significant amount of healthy tissue, rather than any defects or dead/ decayed wood and can not be described as helping to promote a healthy crown structure. The unnecessary pruning of a tree is detrimental to its health.\r\n\r\n\r\nImprove amenity value of the tree (Tree excessively crown lifted previously).\r\nThe amenity value of a tree is rarely improved by pruning and not to my knowledge by crown reduction. While the tree has been excessively pruned in the past, the further pruning will not alleviate this or improve the amenity value. While i would generally accept that the pruning of a tree does not have to reduce its amenity value, I do not believe it would in this instance improve the amenity of the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guidance on the provision of arboricultural reason is outlined on the application form and in Tree Preservation Orders, A Guide to the Law and Good Practice Addendum – May 2009, 6.37.\t\r\nThe specification of works provided is not consistent with the best practice as outlined in the BS 3998: 2010 Tree works – recommendations (7.7). The standard also states that crown reduction should not be carried out at the same time as other pruning works such as crown thinning (7.7.1).\r\n\r\nThe crown reduction of these trees is currently inappropriate. Beech trees are known to not be tolerant of heavy pruning and do not have the capacity to respond well to crown reduction.  For protected trees, the council are only obliged to permit the minimum works to abate a nuisance. No evidence has been submitted to implicate these trees as the cause of any nuisance. We are therefore not obliged to permit the works.  \r\n\r\nGiven the valuable environmental amenity of this tree and the limited supporting justification for the works, the authority is unable to permit the application and as such the refusal of permission is the only possible option at this point."
