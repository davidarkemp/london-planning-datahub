  "description": "Tree works in a Conservaton Area.\r\n\r\nX4 Cherry, 30 % crown thin and 20 % crown reduction.\r\nX1 Cherry, remove.\r\n\r\nThere are a cluster of bird cherries located on a high bank on the North West corner of New River Head. These trees have grown significantly over recent years and they now block out the only sun light received by flat 103. The residents previously were able to benefit from this afternoon sun. Their young child has a dust mite allergy and their paediatric consultant recommended that “sun exposure to bed linen” would kill dust mites . This would have been possible in the fairly recent past but not now. We would hope this health benefit could be also be taken into account in this application. We apply to carry out work which would retain the integrity of the group of trees whilst restoring the light benefit previously enjoyed by the residents. We suggest an overall crown thin of 30% and a canopy reduction of 20%. To the group. We also suggest removing completely the smallest of the five trees which is the second from the right. This will benefit the two adjoining trees. Please refer to the accompanying sketch and enclosed photo.",
