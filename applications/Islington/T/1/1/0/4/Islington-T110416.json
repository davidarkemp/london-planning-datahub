    "While the council will not be imposing a TPO on this tree, we would like to consider further examination to determine whether the tree is structurally unsound. The agent is requested to temporarily refrain from felling the tree until the council has undertaken a Picus test. If the test is favourable then we would ask the applicant to reconsider the removal of this tree. While the tree does not fulfil the criteria for a TPO it does have amenity merit and should be retained if possible."
