Should you do so this is an opportunity to provide further evidence to the Local Authority to enable the Council to consider further information and make an informed decision. If you consider that the tree is causing an actionable nuisance I would advise that you seek a declaration from the High Court that this is the case. \r\n \r\nFailure to appeal this decision or to make an application to the High Court will mean that you have wholly failed to mitigate your loss and the Council reserves the right to defend any claim that you may bring for compensation relating to the tree. \r\n \r\nThe Council requires the following so that it may make an informed decision on whether the tree is the probable cause of the alleged damage to 3 Lloyd Square ; failure to provide this will mean that the Council reserved the right to defend any claim that you may bring for compensation relating to the tree.\r\n \r\n\r\ni)   Full Drainage survey and investigation report\r\nii)  Up to date and more comprehensive crack / level monitoring records\r\niii) Remote control borehole readings \r\n\r\nIf further clarification is required in regards to the detailed nature of the information required, please contact the Local Authority to discuss this."
