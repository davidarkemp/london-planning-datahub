    "Due to the present limited growth habit and juvenile sub-silhouette crown that is present on the crown.  It is of the opinion of the authority that due to the lack of basic evidence, the Ash Tree in 6 Barnesbury Square should be crown reduced by 50%, there is currently totally insufficient evidence to support the removal of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe evidence provided as supporting documentation is rather scant and doesnâ€™t actually identify the tree as the main causal factor.  Infact the evidence so far indicates that other than the poor construction of the rear addition. The likely cause will be related to the water strike and leaking drains/water supply that are present in the exact vicinity of the failure of the structure. The lack of level monitoring information gives no proof that seasonal movement is occuring which could be related to moisture extraction by trees."
