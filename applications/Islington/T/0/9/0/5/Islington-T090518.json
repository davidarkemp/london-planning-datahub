    "The Silver Birch is a semi mature specimen planted in a relatively small front garden. The tree is now starting to encroach on the property, lift the surrounding paving and interfere with overhead phone lines. While pruning is an option that was discussed on site, this species does not react well to repeated pruning and it will result in the reduction of form and health while not resolving the encroachment or paving issues. The option of lesser works is available should the tree owner wish to prune the tree rather than remove but my recommendation would be that the tree be removed and a re-placement planted in the same area. This will ensure the continuation of tree cover in the conservation area while abating the nuisance caused by the current tree."
