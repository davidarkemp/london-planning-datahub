    "The 25% crown thin is envisioned to be a crown thin to the branch ends and not the removal of 25% of crown volume by the removal of the inner crown of the tree. The removal of the inner crown will prompt the tree to grow even more epicomic growth; the crown will become denser and therefore defeat the purpose of thinning in the first place."
