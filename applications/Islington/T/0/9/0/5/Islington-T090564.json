    "While approval to remove this tree has been granted, it does not mean that this tree has no merit. The unusual contorted stem is an attractive feature and the tree despite its defects could be retained. A crown reduction of 20% along with a 20% thin would significantly reduce the weight and pre-empt any stem failure. The size of the tree is in fitting with its location and although not worthy of the imposition of a Tree Preservation Order the tree because of its defects the tree  has amenity value."
