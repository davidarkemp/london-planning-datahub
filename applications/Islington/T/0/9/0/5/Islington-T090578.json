    "While this tree is not worthy of the imposition of a Tree Preservation Order that does not mean it is without merit and the councils decision not to further protect this tree does not mean that we recommend the removal of a healthy, mature tree in a conservation area.\r\nThe council expects to see a replacement tree planted in the front garden of 20 Lysander Grove, N19 3QY. The tree should be planted within one planting season of the removal of the Lime tree. The replacement tree should be a 12-14cm standard of the species recommended by the agent (Rowan)."
