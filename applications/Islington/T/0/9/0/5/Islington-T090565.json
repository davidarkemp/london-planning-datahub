    "The larger Tree of Heaven sucker is now a mature tree in its own right, while not currently worthy of the imposition of a TPO the tree does have merit due to its amenity value. It is causing damage to the boundary wall to the extent that this wall will need to be replaced but  the tree is of good health and vigour and the lean which is given as the prime cause for removal is due to its suppression in early life by the now removed parent tree. As discussed on site I would urge the tree owner to reconsider this trees removal."
