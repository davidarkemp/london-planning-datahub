    "The application to fell the tree has been refused for two equal and unconnected reasons (i) on the basis of loss of a visual amenity and (ii) on the basis that you have failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree should be removed.\r\nT14 has a Ganaderma fungal fruiting bracket growing from the base of a surface root, the bracket has woody growth to indicate that it has been growing in the tree for a number of years. This fungal infection is given as the reason for removal but the tree has no outward symptoms of decline or other indications of structural weakness. Trees can contain this type of fungal heartwood decay for many years before the tree becomes structurally unsound, I believe that with regular monitoring, good management and sympathetic treatment this tree could live healthily and safely for another 20yrs before remedial works are required."
