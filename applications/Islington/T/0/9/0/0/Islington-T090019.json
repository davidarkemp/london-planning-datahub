    "While the authority does not feel that the x4 lime pollards warrant the imposition of a Tree Preservation Order at this time it in no way condones the agents recommendation to remove these trees. These relatively small Lime trees are of moderate water demand and have been pollarded annually to further limit their water uptake. With the relatively minor damage (BRE 2) and medium soil plasticity there is a good chance of soil recovery. The drainage survey has confirmed defective pipe work (the survey was not supplied) which could wash fines from the soil, exacerbating the problem. We would recommend that the drains are fixed, an agreed tree pruning management regime instigated and further monitoring to assess soil recovery."
