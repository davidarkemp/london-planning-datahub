    "The application to prune the tree has been refused for three reasons (i) on the basis of loss of a visual amenity and (ii) on the basis that you have failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree requires pruning (iii) the work specification does not state the extent of the works which could lead to excessive or innappropriate works being carried out.. \r\n \r\nThere is a right to appeal this decision. Should you do intend to do this it is advised that you should consider providing further evidence to the Local Authority, prior to making your appeal, to enable the Council to consider further information and make an informed decision."
