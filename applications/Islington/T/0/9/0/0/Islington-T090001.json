    "The notification to fell the Lime tree at the front of 83 Anson Road has been withdrawn and a Tree Preservation Order (LBI TPO (No.401) 2009) imposed on the tree. This is for two equal and unconnected reasons (i) on the basis of loss of a visual amenity and (ii) on the basis that you have failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree is causing any damage as alleged or at all. \r\n Any works proposed to these trees will require an application to the Authority.  An appeal may be made against the imposition of the TPO. Should you do intend to do this it is advised that you consider providing further evidence to the Local Authority, prior to making your appeal, to enable the Council to consider further information and make an informed decision. If you consider that the tree is causing an actionable nuisance I would advise that you seek a declaration from the High Court that this is the case. \r\nFailure to appeal this decision or to make an application to the High Court will mean that you have wholly failed to mitigate your loss and the Council reserves the right to defend any claim that you may bring for compensation relating to the tree. \r\nIf further clarification is required in regards to the detailed nature of the information required, please contact the Local Authority to discuss this."
