    "The application to fell the tree has been refused for three reasons:\r\n(i)\tThe loss of a visual amenity \r\n(ii)\tThe proposed works are deemed excessive.\r\n(iii)\tInsufficient evidence to support the works proposed.\r\n\r\nThe tree is located adjacent to the front boundary of the property.  It forms an important visual asset along the street scene and provides a unique feature of the area.  It is one of three similar sized Beeches that form a linear feature along this section of the road and make up part of LBI TPO (No.310) 2007. The tree (T15) is of good health and vigour and has been pruned in the past to prevent encroachment towards the property and lifted to allow light to the front garden. Approval has been granted previously for the pruning back from the property (T080167), these works where deemed appropriate by the Planning Authority to increase light to the surrounding area. Sadly this tree has recently suffered severe and poor pruning without the approval of the planning authority.  Pruning works greatly in excess of those approved where carried out and not done to the conditioned standard BS 3998:1989 -Recommendations for tree work and this is being investigated as part of a formal enforcement case.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed pruning of the tree is felt to be unnecessary and excessive and would cause a reduction in the visual amenity value of a tree that is otherwise of good form, this loss of visual amenity would be detrimental to the surrounding landscape in the Canonbury Conservation Area.\r\n\r\nThis healthy tree is of good form and of a species known not to react favourably to crown reduction. The total extent of the pruning works is deemed excessive but especially so since the tree has only recently been heavily pruned. This tree stands out from its neighbours by having been poorly pruned.\r\n\r\nThe application states that the proposed pruning is to abate a nuisance, the nuisance caused by the tree has not been identified and no evidence of any nuisance has been supplied.\r\n\r\nWhile the tree is planted in a relatively small front garden the light loss caused by the tree is not significant. The crown has previously been lifted and pruned to allow light to the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nThere is no current evidence that the trees sphere of influence would be affected by the proposed pruning, Beech is not classed as having a high water demand in NHBC Chapter 4.2. The Authority is not currently aware of any subsidence damage to 19 Canonbury Park north or within the immediate area and no evidence of subsidence to the property has been supplied.\r\n\r\nT15 has a crown that is currently balanced and of good form, the proposed crown reduction of this tree would include the removal of a significant amount of healthy tissue, rather than any defects or dead/ decayed wood and can not be described as helping to promote a healthy crown structure. The unnecessary pruning of a tree is detrimental to its health.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is a right to appeal this decision. Should you do intend to do this it is advised that you should consider providing further evidence to the Local Authority, prior to making your appeal, to enable the Council to consider further information and make an informed decision. If you consider that the tree is causing an actionable nuisance I would advise that you seek a declaration from the High Court that this is the case. \r\n \r\nFailure to appeal this decision or to make an application to the High Court will mean that you have wholly failed to mitigate your loss and the Council reserves the right to defend any claim that you may bring for compensation relating to the tree. \r\n \r\nIf further clarification is required in regards to the detailed nature of the information required, please contact the Local Authority to discuss this."
