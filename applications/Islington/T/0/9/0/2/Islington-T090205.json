    "Reason for Works\r\nThe specimens are located near to the front flank boundary of the property which is located in the smaller western area of the garden of the public house.  The specification now agreed is an alternative specification as the original proposal to thin the crown of tree T16 was recommended by a consultant working for the agents for the site after roots of the tree were excavated without prior approval by the use of a mini-excavator.  The consultant thought that thinning the tree would aid the tree in its recovery from the stress of having the roots severed.  However the authority negotiated an alternative specification with the applicant as the thinning works were not deemed appropriate as they would increase the air circulation through the crown and this would lead to greater evapotranspiration of water from the tree and place it under greater stress.  The current revised specification is felt to be a more sympathetic way of removing the leaf area.  The thinning works were only recommended by the consultant as a possible way to address the issue of root severance and there is no indication within the report as to an alternative reason for the requiring the work.  The tree is currently showing signs of stress within the crown but the tree will need to be closely monitored for the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe works proposed to T17 are an addition to the original application and this is felt to be appropriate to deal with the low hanging branches that are currently low over the road."
