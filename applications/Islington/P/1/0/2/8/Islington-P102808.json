    "REASON:  The enlargement of the front lightwell, loss of planting area, installation of a staircase to the front lightwell and a second line of railings to the front garden would result in an incongruous addition to the front of this dwelling house which would be harmful to the established character and appearance of the building and the wider streetscape.  This proposal is contrary to policy 9 of the Draft Core Strategy, policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations & Extensions) and D29 (Basements) of the Unitary Development Plan 2002 and Islingtonâ€™s Urban Design Guidance 2006."
