    "REASON : The proposed extension is considered by reason of its design, scale and siting to fail to respect the architectural integrity of the property and those surrounding and the wider established rhythm and arrangement of the terrace.  The proposal is considered to have a harmful effect on the quality of the surrounding public realm especially views available from Sussex Way.  The proposal is not considered to comply with the objectives of policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan and part 2.5 and 2.6 of the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
