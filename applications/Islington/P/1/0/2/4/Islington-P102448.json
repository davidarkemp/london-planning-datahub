    "REASON: The proposed Horsell Road development, by reason of its incongruous design and the materials used, would be unsympathetic and out of character with the adjoining building and the street scene, and therefore detrimental to the character and appearance of the St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area. The application is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in context), D5 (Townscape), D22 (New development), and D24 (Materials) of Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002),and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
