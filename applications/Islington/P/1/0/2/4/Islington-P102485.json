    "REASON:  The proposed rear roof extension would be damaging to the roof form and appearance of the main building and of the roofline of this group of properties and would have an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the Sotheby Road Conservation Area, particularly when viewed from Ardilaun Road.  The proposal would therefore conflict with policy 9 of the Draft Core Strategy, policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations & Extensions) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of the Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
