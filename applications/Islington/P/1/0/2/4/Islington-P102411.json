    "REASON: The proposed first floor addition by reason of its inappropriate design, scale and massing is considered to be contrived and incongruous bearing no relationship to the existing design and appearance of the host building. The addition would appear as a visually discordant feature which would significantly harm the character and appearance of the host building and its setting within the St Mary’s Magdelene Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to polices D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, policy 9 of Islington’s Draft Core Strategy, Islington’s Urban Design guidance 2006, Conservation Guidance Note 5 and PPS 5."
