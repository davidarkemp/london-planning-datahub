    "Reason: The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate scale, massing and appearance fails to respect its surrounding context. The development is considered to form an overdominant and discordant feature when viewed from both the public/private realm, adversely impacting on the existing character and appearance of the building, the terrace in which it is situated and the wider Chapel Market/Penton Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Islington's Unitary Development Plan policies D1 (Design), D4 (Design in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D28 (Rear extensions), policy 9 of Islington’s Draft Core Strategy, conservation note 33, Islington’s Urban Design Guidance 2006 and PPS 5."
