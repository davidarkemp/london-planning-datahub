    "REASON: The proposed satellite dish, communal aerial and mast pole would be incongruous additions to the highly visible western gable end and would be visually intrusive particularly when viewed from Green Lanes. The proposal is considered to fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Newington Green Conservation Area.  The development would therefore fail to comply with to policies D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context) and D11 (Alterations and extensions) of the Islingtonâ€™s Unitary development Plan (2002), the Islington Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
