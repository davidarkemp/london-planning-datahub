    "REASON: The proposed external wall insulation render would result in a visually incongruous form of development failing to appropriately integrate with the architectural detailing of the building to the  detriment to the character and appearance of the locally listed building and the character of the Hillmarton Conservation Area contrary to Policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D24 (Materials) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002).  The proposal would be further contrary to the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Urban Design Guide (2006)."
