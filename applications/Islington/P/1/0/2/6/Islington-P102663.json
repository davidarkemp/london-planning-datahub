    "REASON: The proposed removal of the two windows on the front elevation and creation of four new openings will be detrimental to the original and unique character and appearance of this prominent corner building and the relationship of the front and side elevations with regard existing fenestration. This alteration is considered to be harmful to the character and appearance of the Chapel Market/Penton Street Conservation Area. The development is contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D22 (New Development) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Section 2.3.1 of Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006), Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development, and Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
