    "REASON: The proposed side extension, by reason of its location, scale, design and impact on important architectural elements of the listed building would be detrimental to the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and would have a negative impact on the spatial qualities, character and appearance of the Canonbury Conservation Area. Due to the harm to the significance of the heritage assets, the proposal is therefore not in accordance with Policies D1 (Overall design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) and D26 (Side extensions) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), strategic policy 9 of the Core Strategy (2010), Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2001), PPS5 (Planning for the Historic Environment) and Historic Environment Planning Practice Guide and English Heritage’s publication “London terraced Houses – 1660-1860” (1995)."
