    "Reason: The proposed extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing and frontward projection would form a discordant feature when viewed from the street and would have a detrimental effect on the architectural significance and appearance of the host grade 2 listed building and the wider surrounding conservation area. The proposed development would also result in the loss of the integral open and spacious character which exists between the end of terrace dwelling and the adjoining semi-detached villas in this section of Belitha Villas. This openness and spaciousness is considered to be an important component of the character and appearance of the area and would be severely compromised as a result of this proposed development. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to policies  D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D26 & D27 (Side extensions), policy 9 of  Islington’s Draft Core Strategy, Islington’s Urban Design Guidance 2006,  Conservation Guidance Note 10  and PPS 5."
