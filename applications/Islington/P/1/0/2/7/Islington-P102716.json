    "REASON: The proposed extensions to the rear elevation and roof of the dwelling, by reason of their design, form and size, would introduce alterations that are out of character and detrimental to the appearance of the existing building and surrounding built form, would result in an inappropriate reduction in the open character of this section of the street, and would be overdevelopment of the site. The development is considered unsympathetic to the existing building and the street scene, and would fail to preserve or make a positive contribution to the setting of the Newington Green Conservation Area. The development is contrary to policies D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2006, and Policy HE10 of Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
