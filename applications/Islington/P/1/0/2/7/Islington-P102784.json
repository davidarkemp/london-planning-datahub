    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would be harmful to the appearance of the property and particularly the terrace in which it is situated and would fail to respect the principle laid out in section 2.4.2 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by disrupting the largely unaltered roofline of the terrace, to the detriment of the appearance of the surrounding area.  The proposal would conflict with CS2 (Finsbury Park) and CS9 (Protecting & Enhancing Islington’s Built & Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy (2011); and policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
