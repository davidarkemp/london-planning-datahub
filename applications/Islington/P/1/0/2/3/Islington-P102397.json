    "REASON: The installation of the proposed railings would be harmful to the architectural interest of the facade of the listed building, by virtue of their unsympathetic modern design and excessive height. The proposal therefore goes against the principles laid down in Planning Policy Statement 5 \"Planning for the Historic Environment\". It would also conflict with the requirements of Policy D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, which requires alterations to be sympathetic to the architectural character and detail of the original building)."
