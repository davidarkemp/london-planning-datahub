    "REASON: The proposal would result in the loss of historic fabric, fundamentally change the roof form of the listed building and, therefore, harm its significance.  The retention of the original roof form is more important following the loss of the original roof forms to many houses in the terrace prior to it being listed. The proposal is therefore harmful to the special significance of the host Grade II listed building and would  harm the surrounding Duncan Terrace / Colebrooke Row Conservation Area. The proposal is for this reason contrary to PPS 5 (Planning in the Historic Environment), Policy CS 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Emerging Core Strategy and  the Conservation Area Design Guidelines SPG."
