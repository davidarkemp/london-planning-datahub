    "REASON: The new shopfront, by reason of the loss of a stallriser, results in the loss of traditional element within the shopfront and a change of proportions which is detrimental to the historic visual appearance and character of the host building, street scene and the wider Cross Street Conservation Area.   The loss of the stallriser element would also result in an unbalanced elevation to 144 – 146 Upper Street, a short section of the parade design as one of which No. 144 – 145 have traditional shopfront details such as a stallriser.  The new shopfront is therefore contrary to Policy 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Draft Core Strategy and policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D13 (Shopfronts) and D22 (New Development) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002).  The proposal would further fail to comply with the Shopfront Design Guide (2003) and the Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
