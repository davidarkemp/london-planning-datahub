    "INFORMATIVE: Only two external changes are proposed. The replacement of sliding folding doors to the non-original, basementâ€“level, full-width rear extension with powder-coated, aluminium-framed patio doors would qualify as permitted development by virtue of the terms of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, as amended by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No.2) (England) Order 2008. Provided that they would not have an upstand of more than 150mm as drawing PP/02 suggests, the proposed skylights in the butterfly roof would also be permitted development by virtue of the terms of Class C of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, as amended by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No.2) (England) Order 2008. Planning permission will therefore not be needed from this Council for these works."
