    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate layout, height, massing, design and appearance would harm the character and appearance of the streetscenes, and would unacceptably harm the character, appearance and setting of the grade I registered landscape ‘Bunhill Fields Burial Ground’, the grade II and II* statutorily listed headstones, monuments and structures within it and the Bunhill Fields and Finsbury Square Conservation Area in which they are located. The scheme would not introduce such benefits to the area that would outweigh the harm caused to the setting of these designated heritage assets and therefore the proposal fails to comply with PPS5, policies 3A.26, 3D.14, 3D.15, 4B.1, 4B.8, 4B.11, 4B.12 of the London Plan (2008), policies CS7, CS9, CS15 of Islington’s Core Strategy (2011), policies D4, D5 and D6 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the Bunhill Fields / Finsbury Square Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
