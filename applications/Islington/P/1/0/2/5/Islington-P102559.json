    "Reason: The proposed extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing, and height would form a discordant feature when viewed from the street and would have a detrimental effect on the appearance of the property and the surrounding conservation area. The proposed development would also  result in the loss of the integral open and spacious character which exists between the end of terrace dwelling and the larger adjoining semi-detached villa in this section of Richmond Avenue. This openness and spaciousness is considered to be an important component of the character and appearance of the area and would be severely compromised as a result of this proposed development. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to policies D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), policy 9 of  Islington’s Draft Core Strategy, Islington’s Urban Design Guidance 2006,  Conservation Guidance Note 10  and PPS 5."
