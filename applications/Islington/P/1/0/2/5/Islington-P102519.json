    "CONDITION: The portion extended out northwards from the original 1st floor level landing of the metal garden access stair on the eastern side of 15D Lonsdale Place - the portion spanning from immediately adjacent to the door of the 1st floor kitchen across to the northern end of the ground floor level bathroom projection, and shown on drawing 3467 AD(0) 23 - shall only be accessed for the purpose of maintenance or repair, and shall not be used as a balcony, walkway, sitting out area or amenity space of any kind. In order to block access to the remainder of the extended structure from the original stair landing, the existing balustrade around the stair landing shall continue to return straight back to the main wall of the building immediately to the north of the door from the 1st floor kitchen, as shown on drawing 3467 AD(0) 23. This section of balustrade shall be retained in situ, and no balustrading shall be provided around any part of the remainder of the extended structure.\r\n\r\nREASON: In order to prevent loss of privacy for residents of nearby properties, in line with the requirements of Policy D3 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
