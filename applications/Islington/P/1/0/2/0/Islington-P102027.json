    "REASON: The equipment cabinet would harm the streetscene by virtue of its proposed location immediately on the boundary of a small landscaped open space, forming an unwelcome visual obstruction to the space. The resultant addition to visual clutter would be harmful to the character of this part of the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The proposal would run counter to Policies Env9 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene) C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Extensions and Alterations) and D19 (Conservation Areas of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and section 2.6.3 of the Islington Urban Design Guidelines (2006)"
