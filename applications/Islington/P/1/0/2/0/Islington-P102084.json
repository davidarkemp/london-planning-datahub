    "CONDITION: The extract ventilation system should be installed with a suitable odour control system, including regular degreasing/maintenance, and stack dispersion. This is to avoid any cooking odours from the food business establishment adversely affecting the general amenity. The following details shall be carried out to protect the general amenity:\r\n\r\n1. Regular maintenance and cleaning of the filter systems is required to ensure that the air is properly cleaned before exhausting.   Within two months of the date of this permission the developer/food business operator shall submit a detailed maintenance and cleaning schedule of the installed system in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions;\r\n\r\n2. Any system used must be constructed so that the filters and other parts requiring cleaning or replacement are easily accessible.\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n\r\nMeasures must be taken to ensure the cooking smells exhausted from the premises do not cause a nuisance to any other residents, commercial or residential. The measures should include: the installation of appropriate and effective filtration systems that deal with the cooking smells produced and the positioning of the final exhausting point of the flue so that the risk of causing a smell nuisance is reduced (stack dispersion). Usually the location of the final exhaust point 1m above eaves level is the best option but the context of the premises and surrounding buildings need to be considered.\r\n\r\nREASON: To ensure the amenity in the locality is not prejudiced."
