    "REASON: The proposals by reason of their design and siting are considered to have a poor relationship with and cause unnaceptable harm to the architectural and historical interest of the listed building. The features are not considered to be in keeping with, and would be harmful to the established character of the designated area.  The harm is considered to be increased by the visual prominence and visual interest of the building in the area.  The development is contrary to guidance of PPS5 : Planning and the Historic Environment, policies C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context),  D11 (Extensions and Alterations), D24 (Materials) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), Section 2.6.3 of the Islington Urban Design Guidelines (2006), guidance within the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Strategic Policy 9 of the Islington Core Strategy Submission Document June 2010."
