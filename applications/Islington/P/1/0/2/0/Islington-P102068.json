The development is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), C16 (Public Utility Apparatus), C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), T47 (Streetscape), Env9 and Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and Streetscene) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
