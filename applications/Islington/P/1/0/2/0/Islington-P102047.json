    "REASON: The outbuilding structure is located in the position of replacement tree planting required as part of a Tree Replacement Enforcement Notice (TRN) for the un-notified removal of trees in the Barnsbury Conservation Area in contravention of Section 211 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). By virtue of the location of the structure in the garden removes the ability of planting the replacement trees in accordance with the TRN and continues to result in a detrimental impact on the Barnsbury Conservation Area by virtue of not conforming to the enforcement notice, does not improve the environment and does not have an environmentally sympathetic relationship to the character and features of the local area.  As such the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies ENV1 (New Developments), ENV5 (Protecting Trees), ENV6 (Protecting Trees) and D6 (Landscaping and public features) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002) and Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
