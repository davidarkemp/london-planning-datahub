    "REASON: The proposed satellite boxing proposed along the main entrances and front elevations of Morgan Mansions are considered to create visually harmful features which would have a detrimental visual impact on the existing character and appearance of the host building and wider conservation area setting.  The development would therefore fail to comply with to policies  D4 (Designing in context) and D11 (Alterations and extensions) of the Islington’s Unitary development Plan (2002), policy 9 of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, the Islington Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
