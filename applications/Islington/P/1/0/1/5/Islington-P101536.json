    "REASON: The proposed retention of an access gate for a temporary period is considered to be an unacceptable development within this residential area. The proposed development located in close proximity to adjoining residential properties is considered to give rise to significant increases in the movements of people and cars in the vicinity of the site which are considered to have a detrimental impact on the amenity levels of adjoining occupiers in terms of noise disturbances, loss of privacy and security and safety concerns. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policy D3 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
