  "description": "The replacement of 2 existing rear upper ground floor windows serving Flat 42A And 42B Hilldrop Crescent with open able doors.  Installation of 2 stairways which provide access from the proposed doors at rear upper ground floor level to the rear lightwell located at lower ground floor level.  This will allow use of the lightwell as outdoor amenity space for the 2 properties.  Installation of a fence within the rear lightwell to separate the external space within the lightwell between the 2 properties.",
