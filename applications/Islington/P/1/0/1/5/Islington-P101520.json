    "REASON: The roof storey exceeds the height of the highest part of the original roof. The development cannot therefore be permitted development within the meaning of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No.2) (England) Order 2008 since it would conflict with the requirements of Sub-section B.1(a) of Class B of the Schedule to that order. The rear wall of the extension was not completed, the front and roof to the new storey had not been formed, and the valley roof of the property was still in situ when the property was inspected in June 2010. The roof storey has therefore not been in existence for four years or more and has not become lawful on that basis."
