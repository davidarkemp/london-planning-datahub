    "REASON:  The proposed erection of the internally illuminated advertisement signage by reason of its design, scale, method of illumination and prominent siting are considered to create a visually dominant and harmful feature to the existing building and surrounding residential area along Market Road. The development therefore fails to respect its local context and pattern of development within the surrounding area. The proposed erection of the advertisement signage is therefore considered to be contrary to polices D1(Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), Env 11 (Advertisements) of Islington’s Unitary Development Plan 2002, policy 9 of Islington’s Draft Core Strategy,  Islington’s Urban design guidance 2006 & PPS 19."
