    "REASON: The proposed alterations by reason of their poor design, scale and overall appearance would fail to take any account of the historic significance of the host buildings historical context. The development is considered to have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host building, its wider setting within a well established shopping frontage within Chapel Market and the its wider conservation area setting. The proposed development  is therefore contrary to Policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D13 (Shopfronts) and D24 (Materials) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington Shopfront Design Guide, conservation guidance note 33, Policy 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of Islington's Draft Core Strategy and Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
