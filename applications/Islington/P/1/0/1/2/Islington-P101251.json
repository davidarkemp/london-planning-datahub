    "REASON: The property is located within a terrace where properties were built without a habitable front basement and sitting behind a modest planted front garden area. The excavation of the bulk of the front garden area to create a basement-level lightwell would be out of character with the original property, and with the terrace as a whole. It would therefore fail to satisfy the objectives of PPS5 with respect to the preservation of the historic environment and heritage assets within it, as well as those of Policies D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, as amplified by the Urban Design Guide 2006, with regard to respecting the character of the original building and its surroundings."
