    "REASON: The property is located within a terrace where properties were built without a habitable front basements  sitting behind for the majority modest planted front garden areas. The excavation of the bulk of the front garden area to create a basement-level lightwell would be out of character with the original property, and with the terrace as a whole. It would therefore fail to satisfy the objectives of PPS5 with respect to the preservation of the historic environment and heritage assets within it, as well as those of Policies D1 (Overall design),  D4 (Urban Context), D11 (Alterations and extensions)  and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, policy 9 if Islington's Draft Core Strategy as amplified by the Urban Design Guide 2006, with regard to respecting the character of the original building and its surroundings."
