    "REASON: The proposed banner scheme by reason of increased visual clutter would have a harmful effect on the streetscene environment, townscape and on the character and appearance of the Mercers Road/ Tavistock Terrace and St Johnâ€™s Grove Conservation Areas.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies Env1 (New Developments), Env9/ 10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Street Scene), Env11 (Advertisements and Signs) and D1 (Overall Design) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002).  The proposal would be further contrary the Conservation Area Design Guide (2002), The Islington Street Book (2006) and the Outdoor advertisements and signs: a guide for advertisers (2007). The application is therefore recommended for refusal."
