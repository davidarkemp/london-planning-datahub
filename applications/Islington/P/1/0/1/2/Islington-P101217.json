    "REASON: The proposed addition of an additional third floor and second floor rear extensions by reason of their excessive  scale, bulk and massing are considered to form an  over dominant development which would bear no relationship to the existing scale and context of the host buildings and which would result in an overdevelopment of the site. The developments would visually dominate the host buildings to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host buildings, wider terrace and its conservation setting. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to polices D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, policies 9, 10 and 12 of Islingtonâ€™s Draft Core Strategy, Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006, Newington Green Conservation Guidance Note and PPS 5."
