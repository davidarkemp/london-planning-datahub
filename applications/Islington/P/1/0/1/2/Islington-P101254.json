    "REASON: The proposed banner scheme by reason of increased visual clutter would have a harmful effect on the streetscene environment and the townscape, The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies Env1 (New Developments), Env9/ 10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Street Scene), Env11 (Advertisements and Signs) and D1 (Overall Design) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002).  The proposal would be further contrary the Islington Street Book (2006) and the Outdoor advertisements and signs: a guide for advertisers (2007)."
