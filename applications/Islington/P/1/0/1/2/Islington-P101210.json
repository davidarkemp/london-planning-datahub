    "REASON: The alterations to the roof and installation of rooflights to the front roofslope would spoil the roof form and architectural style of the main building and would be damaging to the largely unaltered roofline of the host terrace.  The proposal would further have an adverse impact upon the quality of the public realm, as the roof is readily visible from the street on all side.  Overall, the proposal would fail to respect the principles laid out in Section 2.4 (Uniform/ Consistent Street Frontages) of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006). The proposal would also fail to comply with policy 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Draft Core Strategy, policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations & Extensions) of the Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
