    "REASON:  The proposed erection of an internally illuminated poster panel by reason of its excessive design, scale, method of illumination and prominent location is considered to create a visually dominant and harmful feature to the surrounding area along Holloway Road. The development therefore fails to respect its local context and pattern of development while having a significant detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the St Mary’s Church Gardens Conservation Area. The proposed erection of the advertisement panel is therefore considered to be contrary to polices D1(Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D24 (Materials), Env 11 (Advertisements) of Islington’s Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington’s Urban design guidance 2006, St Mary’s Church Gardens Conservation Area  guidance note, PPS 5 & PPS 19."
