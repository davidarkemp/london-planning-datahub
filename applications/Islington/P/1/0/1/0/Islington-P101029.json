The development therefore does not \taccord with the objectives of policies D1( Overall Design); D3 ( Site Planning); D4 (Designing in context) of the Islington UDP; Policy 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy Submission Draft; PPS1 ( Delivering Sustainable Development) and PPS15 ( Planning and the Historic Environment)."
