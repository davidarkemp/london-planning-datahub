    "REASON: The installation of railings and associated plinth to the section of the narrow pavement in front of no. 107 Bridgeman Road would fail to maintain adequate pavement width and would fail to create a safe and legible environment by obstructing pedestrian movement.  In addition, due to the close proximity of the main entrance to the Islington West Library the proposal would raise unnecessary impediment to users of the public library including people with disabilities, children, the elderly and parents with children.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policies Env1(New Developments), T47 (Streetscape), D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning) and D19 (Conservation Areas) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
