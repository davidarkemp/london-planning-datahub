    "REASON: The proposed timber decking and associated railings, by reason of their location, scale and the materials used, would reduce the openness of the forecourt area and would be an incongruous feature on the street scene. The decking would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing building, street scene, and the wider Barnsbury Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D13 (Shopfronts) and D22 (New Development) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington Shopfront Design Guide, Policy 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of Islington's Draft Core Strategy, Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development and Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
