    "REASON : The proposed replacement windows are considered by their design and appearance to cause harm, and be detrimental to the architectural integrity and appearance of the building and therefore the visual appearance and character of the surrounding area.  In addition the loss of the existing windows which are considered to form an integral part of the buildingâ€™s appearance and consideration as an undesignated heritage asset is considered unacceptable.  The harm of the proposal is further increased by the disruption to the established consistency and unity of the facades of the building that will occur as a result of the works.  The proposal is considered to fail to accord with the objectives and guidance of policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context and D11 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006 and Planning Policy Statement 5 : Planning and the Historic Environment."
