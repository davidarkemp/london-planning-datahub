    "This proposal has been refused following consideration of all the \trelevant policies in the Development Plan (Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the London Plan 2008), Government Planning Policy \tGuidance/Statements and other material considerations.\r\n\r\nThis decision has been taken by officers under delegated authority.\r\n\r\nThe proposed alteration to the boundary wall is considered to be \tunsympathetic to the character of the Sotheby Road conservation Area; it does not respect the character and detail of the original walls in \tthe area, and fails to reinstate the front boundary wall in accordance with the objectives of the Islington UDP. The development is therefore fails to comply with policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations \tand Extension) D19 and D31 of the UDP, Policy 9 ( Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy submission Draft, Policy 4B.12 of the London Plan; and PPS5 ( Planning and the Historic Environment)."
