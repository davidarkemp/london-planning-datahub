    "REASON: Due to materials, design and appearance the new shopfront and shop door is detrimental to the historic visual appearance and character of host building, street scene and the wider Keystone Crescent Conservation Area.  The new shopfront and shop are therefore contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D13 (Shopfronts) and D24 (Materials) of the Islington UDP 2002 and policy 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Draft Core Strategy, Islington Shopfront Design Guide (2003) and Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
