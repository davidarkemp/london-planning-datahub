    "Reason: The proposed development by reason of its excessive design, scale, massing and overall footprint fails to respect its surrounding local context. The development is considered to form an overdominant and discordant feature when viewed from both the private and public realm while adversely impacting on the existing character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Islington's Unitary Development Plan policies D1 (Design), D4 (Design in context), D5 (Townscape) ENV 1(New Development), H3 (Housing), Policy 9 of Islington’s Draft Core Strategy, Islington’s Urban Design Guidance 2006 and PPS 5."
