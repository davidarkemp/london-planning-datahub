  "description": "The existing building is a Grade II Listed terrace house, (4 storey including basement), with an existing bomb shelter and brick extension in the rear garden. (Refer to attached photographs). The proposal shows a restoration of the house as a single family house. This proposal is for a modest improvement to the existing bomb shelter and extension, which is being modified to increase the family living space. It is intended to regenerate the use of the bomb shelter and incorporate it into the use of the house. In order to differentiate the extension from the house, the fascia will be clad with cedar timber boards, whereas the existing house is brick. The timber cladding will highlight the original features of the main house as it will be a contemporary extension, rather than competing with the original features. At present the extension looks very tired and is in need of an update. It is proposed that the extension will have level access glass bi fold doors into the garden and the bomb shelter will have a circular glazed window to allow natural light within the space. The circular window is proposed rather than a square window so that it stands out as a feature to differentiate the bomb shelter from the rest of the house. It is also proposed to create double doors to open into the garden within the existing sash window sympathetically by mimicking the style and design of the existing windows. The proposed en-suite in the second floor bedroom will acquire a modest waste flow pipe to the rear elevation where there are also pipes existing.",
