    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale and massing would represent an unsightly interruption to the unaltered and uniform roof forms along Brayfield Terrace and would fail to respect the significance of the designated asset.  The development is considered to have a detrimental impact on the established character and appearance of the original building and the terrace to which it forms part. The proposal is contrary to policies D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D25 (Roof extensions)  of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, policy 9 of Islington’s Draft Core Strategy, Islington’s Urban Design Guide 2006, conservation guidance note 10 and PPS 5."
