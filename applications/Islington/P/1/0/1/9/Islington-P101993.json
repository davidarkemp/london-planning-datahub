    "REASON: By reason of their design and location the proposed 2x fascia signs will not align or be visually sympathetic to the shopfronts, and will be visually incongruous with the main building. The signage is therefore detrimental to visual amenity, and is out of character and detrimental to the existing building and streetscene.  The proposed signage is contrary to policies Env11 (Advertisements and Signs), D1 (Overall Design) and D4 (Designing in Context) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Shopfront Design Guide, and Policy 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of Islington's Draft Core Strategy."
