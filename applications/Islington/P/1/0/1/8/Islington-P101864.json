    "REASON:  The proposed residential accommodation would result in the loss of a B1 (Business) site that is capable of being used for the full range of B1 uses on grounds of accessibility, size and location. Furthermore, insufficient evidence of an unsuccessful B1 marketing campaign being conducted for an adequate period of time was provided. The application is therefore contrary to policy E4 (Loss of Business Use) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
