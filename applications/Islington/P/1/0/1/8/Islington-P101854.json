    "REASON: The proposed structure to the courtyard by reason of unacceptable design and increased visual clutter would have a harmful effect on the courtyard and consequently the setting of the buildings including the Grade II Listed Former Hornsey Road Baths and the Grade II Listed gatehouse.   The proposal would therefore be contrary to PPS5 ‘Planning and the Historic Environment’, policy 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Draft Core Strategy, policies Env1/Env2 (New Development), Env12 (Community Safety), D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations & Extension) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
