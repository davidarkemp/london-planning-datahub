    "REASON: The proposed telecommunications equipment by reason of its design and siting would cause nuisance and obstruct the flow of pedestrians along the footpath.  The proposal will in this location integrate poorly with the street environment, provide unnecessary obstruction and compromise safety.   The proposal does not comply with policies Env9 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), Env12 (Community Safety), C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning) and D4 (Designing in Context) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, the principles of the Islington Streetbook Supplementary Planning Guidance (2005) and the standards of the Department for Transports â€˜Manual for Streets (2007)."
