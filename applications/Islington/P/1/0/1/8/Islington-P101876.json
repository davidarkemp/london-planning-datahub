    "REASON: The proposed development, by reason of its proximity to nearby trees, will have a detrimental impact on the form and appearance of the protected trees from the proposed pruning to facilitate the development, and there is insufficient information to demonstrate that the foundation design would not have a significant detrimental impact on the long term health and amenity of adjacent trees, most notably the protected Plane tree. The development would therefore be detrimental to the health and stability of protected trees and fail to provide a satisfactory standard of visual amenity, contrary to policies Env6 (Protecting Trees), D1 (Overall Design) and D3 (Site Planning) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002) and policy 3D.15 (Trees and Woodland) of the London Plan 2008 (as consolidated in 2004)."
