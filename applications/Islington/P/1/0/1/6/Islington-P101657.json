    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing and bulk would represent an overdominant and discordant feature when viewed from both the public and private realm. The development is therefore considered to have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host building, its setting along Hemingford Road and its wider setting within the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The proposal is contrary to policies D1 (Overall design), D4(Designing in context)  and D11(Alterations and extensions), D25 ( Roof extensions)  of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, policy 9 of Islingtonâ€™s Draft Core Strategy, Islington Urban Design Guide 2006,conservation guidance note 10  and PPS 5."
