    "REASON: The proposed display of 6 banner adverts on lampposts within and around St John’s Lane by virtue of their number, size and high visibility would have a serious detrimental impact on the setting of the Grade I Statutorily Listed St John’s Gate in St John’s Lane and The Priory Church of St John of Jerusalem in St John’s Square as well as the Grade II listed telephone kiosk on Albermarle Road and other listed buildings within St John’s Square, and as a consequence would not preserve or enhance the appearance of the Clerkenwall Green Conservation Area. It is therefore contrary to Government Guidance as set out in PPS 5 (Planning in the Historic Environment) and policies ENV1 (New Development), ENV9, ENV10 (Street Furniture Paving and the Street Scene) ENV11- Advertising and Signs D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context) D11 (Alterations and extensions), D22 (New Development) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and Conservation Area Design Guidelines SPG (2003)."
