    "REASON: The proposed extensions due to its cumulative effect on the property would dominate the rear roof space and elevation and therefore represent excessive alterations to the rear of the property along the terrace row from 94-144 Mercers Road. The proposed development would form a discordant rear feature and is therefore considered to be contrary to Policies to D1 (Urban Context), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D28 (Rear Extensions), Env1 (New Developments), Env17 (Protecting Amenity) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002; objectives in Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy Submission Document June 2010 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2006."
