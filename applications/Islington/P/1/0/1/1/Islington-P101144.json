    "REASON: The proposed roof extension is an unacceptable addition to the building. In particular, this relates to its visibility from St John Street as it impacts on the surrounding buildings and wider area. This is accentuated by the appearance of the windows, both their design and proportions, which is at odds with the building and the surrounding conservation area. To the rear it is also inappropriate due to the lack of a set-back from the edge of the roof, and the design of the windows. The proposal is considered contrary to policies D1, D4, D11, D22, D24 and D25 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and section 2.2 of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
