    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, with associated increases in chimney height and parapet wall, and roof terrace, would fail to respect the unity and rhythm along the roofline in which the host building sits. The detailing of the windows would also fail to respect the host building and wider terrace. The development would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing building (at the front and rear), nearby properties, and the wider Arlington Square Conservation Area. The development is therefore contrary to Policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development) and D25 (Roof Extension) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Arlington Square Conservation Area Design Guidelines and section 2.4 of the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
