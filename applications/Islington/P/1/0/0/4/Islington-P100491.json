    "The proposed roof extension would represent an unsightly interruption from the existing continuous uniform and rhythmic rear roofslopes along the terrace row in Chantry Street. The front basement porch by virtue of its design would dominate the front elevation basement and would impact on the unity of the terrace. The front gate would be inconsistent with the boundary treatment along the terrace. For these reasons the proposal is considered to harm the character and appearance of the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area. The proposals are therefore considered to be contrary to Policies to D1 (Urban Context), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials), D25 (Roof Extensions), D29 (Basements), D30 (Porches) and D31 (Boundaries) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002; objectives in the Core Strategy Submission Document June 2010, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2006 and Conservation and Design Guidelines 2002."
