  "description": "The project is for the upgrade and alteration to the Aberdeen Park Nursery covering both internal and external play spaces. The nursery is located on Highbury New Park in the basement and ground floor of a 4 storey early 19th Century town house. The house is the last in a row of the Highbury New Park conservation area. Our proposal does not increase the internal floor area of the current building. The proposal reconfigures the internal layout to maximise children numbers and the access to quality playspace with a small amount of work (excavation) to the external basement terrace to improve light levels in the 0-2yrs play area. Any external works will be to repair or replace existing features. Alaso full planning reference P100410",
