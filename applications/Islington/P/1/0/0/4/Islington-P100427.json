    "CONDITION:  The metal panels which form the temporary infill shall be constructed as approved and maintained as such until such time as the permanent secondary entrance/exit has been provided, fitted out and is capable to be used for its ultimate intended use as a dedicated secondary entrance/exit to the station.\r\n\r\nPrior approval for bostwick gates is only granted in the instance where those gates would form security gates for the completed secondary station entrance/exit to be located beneath the new roof.  Prior approval is not granted for the installation of bostwick gates for the interim period when the secondary entrance/exit has not been provided and a void space would exist behind the gates.\r\n\r\nREASON:  The provision bostwick gates within the infill area, prior to the use of this space as a station entrance/exit, would have a harmful visual impact and would be injurious to neighbouring amenity."
