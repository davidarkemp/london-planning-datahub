The proposed development is considered therefore to be  contrary to Government Guidance as set out in PPG 15 (Planning in the Historic Environment) and policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context) D11 (Alterations and extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and Conservation Area Design Guidance note 10."
