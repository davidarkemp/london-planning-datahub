    "REASON: The proposed shopfront, by reason of its unsympathetic design and form, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the Locally Listed Building and the wider King's Cross/St Pancras Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11(Alterations and extensions), D13 (Shopfronts), D22 (New Development) and D24 (Materials) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington Council's Shopfront Design Guide."
