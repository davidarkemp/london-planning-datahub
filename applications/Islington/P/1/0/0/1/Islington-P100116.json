    "REASON: The excessively long rear projection is out of scale with the original host building, and which compromises the historic architectural proportions of that building and its relationship with the open garden/yard area at the rear of the building. The retention of the extension would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the building and of the wider conservation area, and would conflict both with the expectations set out in PPG15 and with the principles embodied in Policies D4, D11 and D28 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
