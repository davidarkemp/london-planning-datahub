    "The carriageway narrows towards St. Peters Street and the wall to adjacent properties is of varying height. The exact position is not specified on the plans and therefore it could be positioned in location which would cause security issues. The proposed location will make the cabinet very prominent and it is considered to be visually intrusive in the streetscape. It would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area. It is considered that there is little scope for an alternative location in this sensitive area within the conservation area. The only acceptable option would be to remove the current box and place the new one in the same location."
