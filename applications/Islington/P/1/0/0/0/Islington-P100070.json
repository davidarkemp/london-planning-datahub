    "The use of the whole roof area as a terrace with planting and seating has resulted in views directly into neighbouring habitable room windows. It is  therefore detrimental to the residential amenity enjoyed by the occupiers of these properties. It is for this reason that the development conflicts with policies D3 (Site Planning) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington UDP (2002)."
