    "REASON: The design of the proposed roof storey, with its over-emphatic projecting rear deck and the prominent front elevation and overhang, represents a radical departure from the original character and appearance of the building in the conservation area. The proposal would thus conflict with the requirement of PPG15 that local planning authorities should use their planning powers to avoid detriment to the character and appearance of conservation areas and would also conflict with the expectations of Policies D24 and D25 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002"
