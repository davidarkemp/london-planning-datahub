    "REASON: The proposed dormer extension and associated railings, by reason of the size, design and location will significantly alter the roofscape, and thus will be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building, street scene and wider Newington Green Conservation Area. The development is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development) and D24 (Materials) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), and Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
