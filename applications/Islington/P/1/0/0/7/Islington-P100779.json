    "REASON: The proposed residential units, by reason of their inadequate layout, limited outlook onto the pavement and flat roof of the neighbouring property, and poor functionality within a purpose built commercial premises, will provide an sub-standard level of accommodation, detrimental to the amenity and privacy of host and future occupiers. The application is thus contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning) and D4 (Designing in context) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the Council's Planning Standards Guidelines (2002)."
