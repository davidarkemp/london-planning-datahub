    "REASON: The proposed extension to the roof of the property and the raising of the party walls will have a negative effect on the architectural integrity of the property and the unity of the terrace causing significant harm to the the street scene and appearance and character of the conservation area.  The proposed alterations are considered to be out of keeping with the main property and terrace visible from views on Cruikshank Street, Holford Street and Bevan Way.  The proposal is not considered to comply with the objectives of policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Extensions and Alterations), D24 (Materials) and D28 (Roof Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan, parts 2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide and paragraphs 2.12 and 2.13 of the New River Conservation Area Design Guidelines"
