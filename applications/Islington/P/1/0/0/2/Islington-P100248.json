    "REASON: The proposed erection of a side staircase forming the sole access to the first floor of the host building by reason of its poor use, design and scale is considered to form an overdominant and discordant feature. No details have been provided regarding the proposed self containment of the upper floors. The staircase would be readily visible from the surrounding streetscene and would have a detrimental impact on the existing character and appearance of the host building and wider area. The proposed development is considered contrary to policies D1 ( Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2006 and Islington's Urban Design \r\nGuidance 2006."
