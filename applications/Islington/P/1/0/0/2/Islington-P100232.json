    "REASON: The proposed erection of a third floor roof extension on the existing building by reason of its  excessive rearward height, form and its prominent siting from the public realm when viewed from Kinloch Park would represent an unsightly interruption to the unaltered and uniform roof forms along the eastern section of the terrace along  Hornsey Road. The development would strike a discordant feature when viewed from the rear which is considered to have an adverse impact on the established character and appearance of the Hornsey Road/kinloch Street street scene, the original building and the terrace to which it forms part. The proposal is contrary to policies D1, D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
