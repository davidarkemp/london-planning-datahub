  "description": "1) To slightly widen the aperture of the patio window on the third floor from its current 2160mm to 3120mm and replace the existing 1970's aluminium in-line sliding patio door with a similar looking but more energy efficient equivalent. The height of the window will remain the same and so will have no external impact as the top of the window cannot be seen from the opposite side of Barnsbury Road. The improved view does not over look any residential properties and so will not impinge upon anyone's privacy. The wall is not structural or party and the brickwork above the window will be supported by a 150 x 100 Steel I beam which will overlap by a minimum of 150mm on top of the walls either side of the window. The narrowest of the walls either side of the window (supporting the steal beam) will be 460mm (internal) and 850mm (external). The rendering on the upper external brickwork, which is visible and is currently in a poor state of repair, will be re-done and repainted (in the existing white) thereby improving the overall appearance of the somewhat dilapidated exterior. 2) To replace the rotten wooden casement window in the Kitchen on the third floor with another wooden casement window. The aperture will remain unaltered.",
