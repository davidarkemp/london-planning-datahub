    "REASON: The proposals including the installation of projecting CCTV cameras and awning to the external elevations of the building are by reason of their design, prominent location and inappropriate relationship with the host building and surrounding conservation area harmful to the special interest and architectural character of the listed building and the character and appearance of the Canonbury Conservation Area.  The proposal is contrary to policies D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development), and D24 (Materials) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002,  guidance contained within the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and the objectives of PPS5 : Planning and the Historic Environment."
