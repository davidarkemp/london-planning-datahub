    "The proposed glazed rear addition by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing and poor choice of finishing materials is considered to form an overdominant and discordant feature to the rear of the building. The extension would bear no relationship to the host building nor its wider setting within the terrace and would therefore have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host building and its setting within this end of terrace position. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to polices D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006."
