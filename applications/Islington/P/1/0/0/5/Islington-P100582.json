    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its excessive protrusion beyond the dwellings main rear rooflslope would represent an overdominant and visually harmful feature to the rear of the host building. The feature would be readily visible from the public realm along Conewood Street and is considered to have an adverse impact on the established character and appearance of the Conewood Street street scene, the original building and the terrace to which it forms part. The proposal is contrary to policies D1 (Design), D4 (Design in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
