    "REASON: The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive depth abutting the common boundary would form an overdominant and visually discordant feature to the rear of the dwelling to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and wider conservation area setting. The development is also considered to have a significant adverse impact on the adjoining resident’s amenity levels in terms of an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook and is therefore contrary to Polices D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site planning), D4 (Designing in context) and D11 (Alterations and extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, Sotheby Road Conservation note, Islington’s Urban Design Guide 2006 and PPS 5."
