    "REASON: The proposal would be detrimental to the host building, the wider terrace, and the character and appearance of the St John's Grove Conservation Area and the streetscene. This is by virtue of its size and visibility, the removal of the existing gap between the rear of 124 Junction Road and 1 Poynings Road, and the design and arrangement of the windows and doors proposed. This is contrary to policies D1, D4, D11, D22, D24, D26, and D28 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Conservation Area Design Guidelines and parts 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
