    "This application has been approved following consideration of all the relevant policies in the Development Plan (Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 [UDP] and the London Plan 2008), Government Planning Policy Guidance Statements and other material considerations.\r\n\r\nThe decision to grant permission was made by officers under delegated powers on 9th June 2010.\r\n\r\nThe development would help to facilitate the refurbishment of the adjoining Ironmonger Road Baths and, as such, would comply with Policies R1, R17 and R19 of the UDP which seek to protect community uses. The proposed change of use would be temporary until 1st September 2012 and would therefore not result in a permanent loss of a sporting/recreational facility. \r\n\r\nNo external alterations to the building are proposed and it is not considered that the proposal would adversely affect the character, appearance and setting of the adjacent listed building or the conservation area. The development is therefore in accordance with PPS5 and Policy D20 of the UDP which seek to protect the character of the listed building and the conservation area. \r\n\r\nIt is considered that the nature of the proposed uses are such that the development would not result in any undue loss of amenity to adjacent residential properties. As such, the developemnt is in accordance with Policy 3A.18 of the London Plan 2008 and Policy Env17 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 which seek to ensure that new developments do not have an unacceptable impact on residential amenity. \r\n\r\nThe development is subject to appropriate conditions which seek to facilitate the development and mitigate its potential impacts."
