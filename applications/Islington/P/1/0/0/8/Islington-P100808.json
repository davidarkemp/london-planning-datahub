    "REASON: The proposed one-sided roof extension would spoil the architectural character of the distinct original villa style host building and would further have an adverse impact upon the quality of the public realm, particularly when viewed from Moray Road.  Overall, the proposal would fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.3 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by undermining the symmetry of the original building.  The proposal would conflict with policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
