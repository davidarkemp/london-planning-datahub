    "REASON: The proposed replacement of the basement window with a glazed door and side sash window would be detrimental to the proportions and balance of the front elevation, and thus would undermine the architectural integrity of the existing building, and the character and appearance of the street scene and the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The development is therefore contrary to Policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D22 (New Development) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington Council's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), and Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
