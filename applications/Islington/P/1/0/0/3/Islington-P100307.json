    "REASON: The operation of a minicab service is likely to give rise to obstruction to traffic, as a result of cabs stopping at kerbside to pick up passengers or visiting the premises between calls. The creation of a 'pinch-point' between cabs stopped outside the premises and westbound traffic waiting to enter the Highbury Corner gyratory system (part of a Transport for London Red Route) would restrict the flow of eastbound traffic, with the likelihood of traffic backing up onto the gyratory system, causing significant obstruction to the Strategic Road Network and the Red Route. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy E5 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
