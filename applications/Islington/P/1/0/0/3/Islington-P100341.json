    "REASON: The appearance of the proposed window and sliding doors to the rear extension would be unsympathetic to the architectural character of the building and detrimental to the appearance of this part of the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The proposal would go against national principles on the protection of the appearance of buildings in conservation areas, as set out in PPS5 \"Planning and the Historic Environment\". It would also contradict Policy D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 (which seeks that alterations and extensions requiring planning permission should respect the architectural character and detail of the original building) and Policy D24 (which requires the use of traditional materials for refurbishments in conservation areas)."
