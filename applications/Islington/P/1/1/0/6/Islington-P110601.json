    "REASON: The proposed extension, by reason of its location and excessive size, would result in overdevelopment of the site, reducing its openness as well as disrupting the conformed rhythm of the single storey rear elements visible along the terrace. The development is contrary to policies D4 (Designing in context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and Islington's Planning Standards Guidelines (2002)."
