    "REASON: The installation of a canopy and erection of a timber/metal structure with side panelling is considered to result in increased visual clutter and would be visually intrusive when viewed from the street.  In addition, the timber/metal frame structure with side panelling impacts on outlook to the ground floor window at no. 86.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D13 (Shopfronts) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the Islington Shopfront Design Guide."
