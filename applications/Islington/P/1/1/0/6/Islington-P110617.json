    "REASON: The proposed erection of a double storey rear addition by reason of its excessive design, scale, bulk, height and massing is considered to form an overdominant development which would bear no relationship to the existing scale and context of the host building and wider terrace. The developments would visually dominate the host building to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host building and its setting within the wider terrace. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policy 9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies  D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions)  of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 & Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006."
