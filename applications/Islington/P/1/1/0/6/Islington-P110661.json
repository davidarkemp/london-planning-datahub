    "REASON: The separation of the upper floors for use as self-contained flats disregards the guidance on layouts set out in the Islington Planning Standards Guidelines 2002, both in terms of the inadequate size and configuration of rooms and by failing to ensure that entrance to each flat is into a separate hallway, with all other rooms opening off it. The conversion would fail to comply with the requirements of Policy H9 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, which requires that accommodation in units provided by conversion should be adequate in terms of the size, shape and disposition of rooms."
