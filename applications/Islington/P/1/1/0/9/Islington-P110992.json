    "REASON: The proposed flats would provide a poor standard of residential amenity by virtue of being located at the back edge of pavement and at a junction on a very busy road. The poor rear external area provides an inadequate space for respite and ventilation, and due to the lack of division between units, would have the potential for a detrimental impact on the privacy of neighbouring occupiers. The flats would have poor outlook by virtue of their location, and would suffer from unacceptable levels of noise and pollution. The units therefore fail to satisfy the requirements of Policy D3 (Site Planning), H3 (New Housing and Changes of Use to Residential), H7 (Standards and Guidelines), and Env17 (Protecting Amenity) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and Policy CS12 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011)."
