    "REASON: The proposed erection of a roof extension by reason of its excessive design, scale, bulk, massing and height is considered to form an overdominant development which would bear no relationship to the existing scale and context of the host building and its location within the wider terrace. The development would visually dominate the host building to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host building and its wider setting within the terrace. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policy 9 of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 & Islington’s Urban Design guidance 2006."
