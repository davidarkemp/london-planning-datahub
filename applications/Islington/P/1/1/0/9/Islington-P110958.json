    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing and bulk would represent an overdominant and visually harmful feature to the existing character and appearance of the host building. The development would fail to be a subservient addition and would detract from the existing attractive front and rear gables. The development is therefore considered to have a detrimental impact on the established character and appearance of the original building and its location within the Upper Street North Conservation Area. The proposal is contrary to policy 9 of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D25 (Roof extensions)  of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington’s Urban Design Guide 2006, Upper Street Conservation Guidance note and PPS 5."
