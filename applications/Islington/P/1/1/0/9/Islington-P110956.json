    "REASON: The combined design, scale and location of the proposed aerial, dish and cabling would be readily visible from the surrounding public realm and result in clutter visually harmful to the host building thereby failing to preserve the character and appearance of the host building and the wider Canonbury Conservation Area.  The proposal conflicts with guidance contained within the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 of the adopted Islington Core Strategy 2011, saved policies D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan, the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines and section 2.6.3 of the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
