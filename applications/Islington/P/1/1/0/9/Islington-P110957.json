    "REASON: The installation of replacement uPVC windows and double doors to the front and rear elevations at nos. 35 and 37, by virtue of their unsympathetic design and inappropriate materials significantly harms the character and appearance of the original building, the character and integrity of the terrace which it forms a part of and the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy (2011); policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D22 New development) and D25 (Materials) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002); and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
