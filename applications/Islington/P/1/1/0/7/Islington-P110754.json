    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding the details submitted, no site clearance or associated activities can commence whichever is the earlier until an Arboricultural Method Statement (AMS), including a Tree Protection providing details of proposed tree and ground protection in accordance with BS5837:2005 ‘Trees in relation to construction-Recommendations’ have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  In particular the AMS must adequately describe how trees on the site will be protected throughout the site clearance, excavation activities and construction both above ground and below ground and detail the method of hand excavation and the movement of materials within the Root Protection Area (RPA).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe development must be carried out in accordance with the approved AMS.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nREASON: To avoid inappropriate excavations and damage to the retained trees, ensuring that disturbance to the roots are minimised and to maintain a healthy rooting area. To protect the health and stability of the trees, and to ensure that a satisfactory standard of visual amenity is provided and maintained in accordance with policy 3D.15 of the London Plan 2008 and policy Env6 of the Islington UDP 2002."
