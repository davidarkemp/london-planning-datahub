    "REASON: The proposed head end cabinet and catenary cables  proposed along the front elevation of Mallory Buildings are considered to create visually harmful features which would have a significantly detrimental visual impact on the existing appearance of the Locally Listed host building and the Clerkenwall Conservation Area within which it is situated.  The development would therefore fail to comply with  PPS 5 (Planning in the Historic Environment),  policies  D4 (Designing in context), D11(Alterations and extensions),  D22 (Development within Conservation Areas  of the Islington’s Unitary development Plan (2002), policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, the Islington Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
