    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing, additional height and bulk are considered to form an overdominant development which would bear no relationship to the existing scale and context of the host building. The developments would visually dominate the host building to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace and its conservation setting. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policy 9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D25 (Roof extensions), D28 (Rear extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002,  Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006, Chapel Market/Penton Street Conservation Guidance and PPS 5."
