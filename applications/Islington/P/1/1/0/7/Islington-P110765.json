    "REASON: The proposed 3 antennas by reason of their inappropriate design scale, height, bulk and siting in a prominent location would form a dominant and visually harmful development. The proposed development is therefore considered to have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host building and views into the application site within its setting within the Kings Cross Conservation Area. The development is contrary to policy 9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), KINGS Cross Conservation guidance note, section 2.6.3 of the Islington Urban Design Guidelines (2006) and PPS 5."
