    "REASON: The Council considers this small house to be well-suited to occupation by a single household. Its conversion into two flats would conflict with Policy H8 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, which states that the Council will only normally permit the conversion of residential properties into a larger number of self-contained units where the gross floor area of the residential use is more than 120 square metres excluding the stairwell above ground floor level. The gross floor area of this house is almost 30 square metres below the minimum size acceptable for conversion under Policy H8 and there are no special circumstances that would justify an exception being made in this case."
