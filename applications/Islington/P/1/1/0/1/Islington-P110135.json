    "REASON: The proposed mansard roof extension and dormers, by reason of their size and location, would be highly visible, disrupting the rhythm and unity of a predominantly unbroken roofline, with the installation of a glass balustrade also creating visual clutter. The development would therefore be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing building, street scene, and the Newington Green Conservation Area, and would make it difficult for the Local Authority to resist similar development in the vicinity, to the further detriment of the visual amenity of the area. The development is contrary to policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D22 (New Development) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington Council's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006), policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
