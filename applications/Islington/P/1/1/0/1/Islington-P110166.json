    "REASON: It is considered that the proposed A3 (Cafe/Restaurant) by reason of its scale and intensity of use would have a severe detrimental impact in terms on the character of the surrounding residential area while having an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity levels of adjoining occupiers in terms of noise, waste pollution and increased traffic generation and congestion. The application is contrary to policies 11 & 14 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011,   S30 (Loss of retail floorspace), S31 (A2 and A3 Uses), D3 (Site Planning), T32 (On-street servicing), T45 (Land Use Planning), T55 (New Development), T56 (Traffic generation and public transport capacity), and Env 17 (Protecting amenity) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
