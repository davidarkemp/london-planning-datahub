    "CONDITION: Prior to the commencement of any work on site, an engineerâ€™s report of the proposed foundation type taking into account the existing trees shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority before the commencement of the development.  This report shall include construction details of the foundation cross-sections for the areas located adjacent to the trees, showing a method statement which includes using sleeve piled foundations with a reinforced concrete foundation slab and clay board above the existing ground level.  Development shall thereafter take place in accord with the approved details.\r\n\r\nREASON:  To protect the health and stability of tree(s) to be retained adjacent to the site with minimal root damage or excavations, to maintain the soil function underneath the garden room and to ensure that a satisfactory standard of visual amenity is provided and maintained."
