    "REASON: The proposed upvc framed glazed rear infill extension and roof terrace would disrupt the rhythm/ unity and introduce features which fail to respect the scale, form and character of the host terrace.  Due to scale, design, materials and appearance the proposed extension would spoil the architectural character of the building and the terrace.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011); policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extension) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
