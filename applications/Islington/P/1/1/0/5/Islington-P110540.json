    "REASON: The building up of a brick wall on the boundary with 9 Highbury Park and the formation of a roof-level deck spanning the width of the property from that wall to the boundary with 13 Highbury Park would do significant harm to the appearance of the property and of the conservation area. The proposal  therefore conflicts with the principles set out in Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
