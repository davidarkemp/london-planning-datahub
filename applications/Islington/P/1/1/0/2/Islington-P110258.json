  "description": "The proposed works retains the original configuration with the kitchen to the rear and dining space to the front. The opening between the two rooms is widened so that the resulting wall nibs are the same depth as the kitchen units allowing a much better and continuous detail between the two rooms. New covings will strengthen the connection between the two. To the rear we have retained the boiler house but extended the depth of the lightwell and tucked the news stairs behind the boiler house to again improve the light levels and aspect when looking from the kitchen into the re-landscaped garden. The cast iron railings leading from the storage room are to be restored and extended further into the garden where the depth of the light well has been increased. To the front we have increased the depth of the lightwell and steps, creating a storage area under the front garden for bins etc. Although the height of the retaining wall when viewed from the dining space will be only slightly lower than the existing the increased depth, new planting and new doors to the storage should improve light levels and aspect to that room.
