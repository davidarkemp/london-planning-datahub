The specification shall include the quantity, size, species, and positions or density of all trees to be planted and the proposed time of planting. \r\nAll trees shall be planted in accordance with British Standard [BS4043 - Transplanting Root-balled Trees][BS4428 - Code of Practice for General Landscape Operations (excluding hard surfaces)]. \r\n A schedule of maintenance of the trees until successfully established is to be agreed in writing with the local planning authority and implemented. The schedule shall include provision for replacement planting should establishment fail.\r\nIf within a period of 5 years from the date of planting the tree (or any tree planted in replacement for it) is removed, uprooted, destroyed or dies or becomes, in the opinion of the local planning authority, seriously damaged or defective, another tree of the same size and species as that originally planted shall be planted at the same place within the first planting season following the removal, uprooting, destruction or death of the original tree unless local planning authority gives its written consent to any variation.\r\nReason:  To secure the appropriate priovision of amenity trees and to ensure that the life of the trees would not unduly constrained in accordance with policies 3D.15; 4A.3 of the London Plan 2008 and policies: Env6; Env7; Env10; D6 and T47 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
