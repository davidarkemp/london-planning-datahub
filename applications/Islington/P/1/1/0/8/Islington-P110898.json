    "REASON: The three storey rear extension, by reason of it's excessive scale, bulk and massing is considered to form an over dominant development which bears no relationship to the existing scale and context of the host building. The rear extension is considered to have a severe detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host building and its setting within the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to polices D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D22 (New Developments in Conservation Areas), D28 (Rear Extensions in Conservation Areas) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006), Islington's Conservation Design Guidelines (2002), and PPS5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
