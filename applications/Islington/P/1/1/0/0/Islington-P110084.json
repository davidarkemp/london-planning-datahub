    "REASON: The proposed change of use from retail (A1 use class) to (D2 Licenced Bingo Hall) would result in the loss of a retail unit and thus the loss of a former key local shop from this designated district shopping area S5 Archway District Shopping Centre. The proposed D2 use would adversely affect the vitality and viability of the area, the availability of shopping facilities and services available to the local population, and be contrary to the Archway Development Framework as an important main shopping frontage within the area. The proposal would not be consistent with the local regeneration aims of the Council for the Archway area and would conflict with policy S18 (Change of Use from Retail) of the Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Archway Development Framework SPD (2007) and policies CS1 and CS14 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011."
