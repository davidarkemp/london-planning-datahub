    "REASON: Due to design, appearance and choice of materials, the new shopfronts and external shutters would detract from the visual character of the property and the shopping parade and would fail to preserve the character and appearance the surrounding Chapel Market/ Penton Street Conservation Area.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Draft Core Strategy and policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D13 (Shopfronts) and D22 (New Development) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002).  The proposal would further fail to comply with the Shopfront Design Guide (2003) and the Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
