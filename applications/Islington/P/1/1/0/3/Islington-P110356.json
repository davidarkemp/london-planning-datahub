    "REASON: The proposed erection of a rear roof extension on the existing dwelling by reason of its inappropriate scale and mass which will  result in the loss of the angle of the pitch roof would represent an unsightly interruption to the unaltered and uniform roof forms along the southern section of the terrace along Dickenson Road and would have an adverse impact on the established character and appearance of the original building and the terrace to which it forms part. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 9 of Islingtonâ€™s  Core Strategy (2011); policies D3, D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002,  and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
