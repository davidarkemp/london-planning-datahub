    "REASON: The relocation of the existing front door would break the consistent pattern that creates a rhythm at the front of the terrace. The rear extension, as the first alteration of any kind to the original design of the building, would lead to the loss of the rigid building line, have an overbearing impact on the rear of the development, and adversely affect the character and appearance of the setting of the terrace and surrounding conservation area. Therefore the proposal would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area, contrary to policies D4 (Designing in context) and D11 (Alterations and extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, fail to adhere to section 2.3 and 2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and guidance contained within Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, and Policies 8 and 9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011."
