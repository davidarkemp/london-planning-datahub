    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would involve loss of historic roof form and historic fabric, which would be detrimental to the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The proposal would go against the principles set out in the English Heritage guidance document \"London Terrace Houses 1660-1860\" and would conflict with the objectives of Planning Policy Statement 5: Planning for the Historic Environment, as amplified by the associated Historic Environment Planning Practice Guide.\r\nIt would be premature to grant planning permission in the absence of a listed buiding consent."
