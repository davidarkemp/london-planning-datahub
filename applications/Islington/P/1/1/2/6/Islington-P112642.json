    "REASON: The proposed erection of a full width second floor rear extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, bulk and massing is considered to form an overdominant and harmful development. The proposed development would visually dominate the host building to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace and its conservation setting. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policy 9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies  D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials), D28 (Rear extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006, Chapel Market/Penton Conservation Guidance Note  and PPS 5."
