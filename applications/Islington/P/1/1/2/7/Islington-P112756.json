The measurement and/or prediction of the noise should be carried out in accordance with the methodology contained within BS 4142: 1997.\r\n\r\nREASON:  To ensure that the operation of fixed plant does not impact on neighbouring amenity in accordance with policy 7.15 (Reducing Noise and Enhancing Soundscapes) of the London Plan 2011 and policies D3 and Env17 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
