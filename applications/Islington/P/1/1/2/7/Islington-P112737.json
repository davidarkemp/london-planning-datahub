    "The proposed mansard roof extension would significantly disrupt the consistency and unity of the historic unaltered front and rear roofline of the host terrace, and its impact would be compounded by high visibility from both the public and private realm in views from the front, side, and rear, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host locally listed building, the adjoining locally listed terrace and the surrounding East Canonbury Conservation Area. The proposal is contrary to the guidance provided in chapter 2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide; together with policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D25 (Roof Extensions), and D42 (Buildings on the Local List) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002; policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011; and policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments), 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture), and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011."
