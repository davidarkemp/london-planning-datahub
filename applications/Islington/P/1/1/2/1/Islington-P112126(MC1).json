    "1\tPartial Discharge of Condition 7 (Materials) parts (a), (b) and (d) are discharged, however part (c) and the remainder of the external materials are outstanding. Therefore condition 7 is considered to be partially discharged.\r\n\r\nThe information remaining required to fully discharge Condition 7 is:\r\n\r\n1. Detailed design of all windows, casements and reveals to the front elevation, with casements to the left bank of windows from first to third floor level to match. \r\n\r\n2. Details of the proposed paint colour to the window frames (to match across the elevation). It was suggested on site that white would be considered acceptable, but it is also considered that your proposed gray paint colour could be acceptable on the understanding that all window frames are painted to match.\r\n\r\n3. Details and samples of the finishing material for the coping and moulded detailing to the front elevation, along with the proposed paint colour.\r\n\r\n4. Details of the main entrance door to the front elevation, including full details of the broken pediment.\r\n\r\n5. Full details of the street level elevation at ground floor level to the front of the building, including details of the proposed hanging glazed elements and stall-risers to either side."
