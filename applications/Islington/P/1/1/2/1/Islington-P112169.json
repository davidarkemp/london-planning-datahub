    "CONDITION:  Details of screens with a height of 1:75m above the finished floor level of the roof terrace separating the roof terraces from the adjoining properties located to the east and west of the site, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to their installation. \r\n\r\nThe screens shall be installed prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved and the development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved and shall be maintained as such thereafter. \r\n\r\nThe roof located to the east of the eastern screen which forms part of the ground floor rear extension hereby approved shall not be used for any purpose other than maintanance.   \r\n\r\nREASON:  To prevent undue overlooking (oblique, backwards or otherwise) between the resulting dwellings and also to ensure that the resulting visual screen is acceptable in terms of its appearance in accordance with policies: 4B.1 and 4B.2 of the London Plan 2011 and policies: D3; D4 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
