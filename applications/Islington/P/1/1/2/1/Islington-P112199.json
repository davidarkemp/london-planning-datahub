    "REASON: Due to design and appearance the proposal is considered unsympathetic to the historic building and sits uncomfortably with the neighbouring properties. The roof extension fails to respect the established building heights and is therefore incongruous with the area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.4 (Local Character), Policy 7.6 (Architecture) an Policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan (2011); policies CS2 (Finsbury Park), CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of the Islington Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D5 (Townscape) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2002)."
