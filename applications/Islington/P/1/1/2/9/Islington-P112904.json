    "REASON: The proposal and in particular the variation and deletion of conditions to enable the creation of a retail unit of 378 sqm would detract from and would adversely affect the character and identity of the local area and the borough which is defined in part by a good provision of small retail units. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and CS14 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, and emerging policy DM18 of the Development Management Policies (Submission version) 2012."
