    "The rooftop antennas and associated roof fixtures are considered to be visually obtrusive features which would have a detrimental visual impact on the appearance of this building, the street scene by virtue of their  prominent position at an intersection, and would neither preserve or enhance the Mercers Road/Tavistock Terrace Conservation Area within which it is situated.  The development would therefore fail to comply with  PPS 5 (Planning in the Historic Environment),  policies C17,  D4, D11 and D22 of the Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002); policy CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy 2011, the Islington Conservation Area Design Guide (2002), and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
