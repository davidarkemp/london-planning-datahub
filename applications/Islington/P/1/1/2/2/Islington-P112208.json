A change of use is proposed for the lower ground to first floors from office (B1 use class) to theatre (sui generis use class) comprising flexible theatre / rehearsal space, cafe/ bar and ancillary facilities. A change of use / creation of 5 residential units is proposed for the upper floors. The proposals include alterations to the front and rear elevations of the building and the introduction of a projecting bay window to the front elevation at first floor level.'\r\nThis application seeks to vary the wording of condition 8 to remove the requirement to submit evidence that Code for Sustainable Homes level 3 has been met for the residential units.",
