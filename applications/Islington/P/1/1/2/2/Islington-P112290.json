    "The proposed change of use would result in the loss of a further A1 unit within the designated Secondary Retail Frontage, and the provision of another A3/A5 unit within a frontage which is already saturated with A3 and A5 uses. Therefore, the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the retail character of the frontage, further reducing the variety of goods and services offered within the Secondary Retail Frontage. The proposal is contrary to the aims of policy S6 (Secondary Retail Frontages) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, together with policies CS3 (Nagâ€™s Head and Upper Holloway Road) and CS14 (Retail and services) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, and Policy 4.8 (Supporting a Successful and Diverse Retail Sector) of the London Plan 2011, and the guidance contained in the NPPF."
