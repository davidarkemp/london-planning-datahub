    "CONDITION: No works or development shall take place until a full specification of proposed hedge planting has been approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The specification shall include the quantity, size, species, and positions or density of all trees to be planted, how they will be protected and the proposed time of planting. \r\nThe size, number, species and location of replacement trees are to be approved in writing with Greenspace.\r\n A schedule of maintenance of the trees until successfully established is to be agreed in writing with the local planning authority and implemented. The schedule shall include provision for replacement planting should establishment fail.\r\nAll trees shall be planted in accordance with the details and times stated in the specification required by condition [11] and in accordance with British Standard [BS4043 - Transplanting Root-balled Trees][BS4428 - Code of Practice for General Landscape Operations (excluding hard surfaces)]. \r\nIf within a period of  5 years from the date of planting the tree (or any tree planted in replacement for it) is removed, uprooted, destroyed or dies or becomes, in the opinion of the local planning authority, seriously damaged or defective, another tree of the same size and species as that originally planted shall be planted at the same place within the first planting season following the removal, uprooting, destruction or death of the original tree unless the local planning authority gives its written consent to any variation.\r\n\r\nREASON: To ensure that a satisfactory standard of visual amenity is provided and maintained in accordance with policy 3D.15 of the London Plan 2008 and policy Env6 of the Islington UDP 2002."
