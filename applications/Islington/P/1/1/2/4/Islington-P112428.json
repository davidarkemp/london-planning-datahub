    "REASON: The proposed erection of a full width two-storey rear extension by reason of its design, scale, bulk and massing is considered to form an over dominant and harmful development. The proposed development would visually dominate the host building to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace and its conservation setting. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policy CS9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) and D28 (Rear extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Canonbury Conservation Guidelines."
