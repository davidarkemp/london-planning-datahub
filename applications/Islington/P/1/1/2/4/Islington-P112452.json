    "The proposed head end cabinet and catenary cables proposed along the front elevation of the building, and the additional satellite dish and aerial to the rear elevation, are considered to create visually harmful features which would have a seriously detrimental visual impact on the appearance and fabric of this Grade II listed building and the New River Conservation Area within which it is situated.  The development would therefore fail to comply with  PPS 5 (Planning in the Historic Environment),  policies C17,  D4, D11 and D22 of the Islington’s Unitary Development Plan (2002); policy CS9 of the Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, the Islington Conservation Area Design Guide (2002), the New River Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
