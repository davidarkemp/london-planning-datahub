    "REASON: The supporting documents lack sufficient detail to correctly assess the full extent of the impact of the internal proposals on the significance of the heritage asset. Notwithstanding this it is clear, however, that aspects of the proposals (these works having been carried out) harm the significance of the designated heritage asset by virtue of inappropriate design and materials.  Consequently these aspects of the proposals are contrary to policy HE7 and HE9 of PPS5 (Planning for the Historic Environment), the Historic Environment Planning Practice Guide, policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2011 and Strategic policy CS9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011 and policies D11 and D24 of Islignton's UDP 2002."
