    "Reason: The proposed development would result in the loss of the integral open and spacious character which exists between the buildings within this section of Offord Road and Arundel Place. These open gaps between buildings in the area are considered to be an important component of the character and appearance of the area and would be severely compromised as a result of this proposed development. The development is therefore considered to be contrary policy 9 of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D5 (townscape), D22 (New developments), Islington’s Urban Design Guidance 2006, Barnsbury conservation guidance note and PPS 5."
