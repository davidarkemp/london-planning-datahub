    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would be situated within a terrace that has a uniform and predominantly unaltered roofline and by reason of its size, form and location, the extension would be an overdominant and incongruous element within the terrace, disrupting its rhythm and unity.  The development is contrary to policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development), D24 (Materials) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011."
