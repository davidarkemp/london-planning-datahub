  "description": "Change of use of building from B1 use (Business) to two, 5-bedroomed town houses (C3 use).  Internal and external alterations including replacement of non original windows at third floor level and insertion with timber framed double-glazed sash windows and the insertion of two lantern roof lights and five roof lights in roof.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "This proposal has been approved following consideration of all the relevant policies in the Development Plan (London Plan 2011, The Islington Core Strategy 2011 and the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002), Government Planning Policy Guidance/Statements and other material considerations.\r\n\r\n- This decision was made  under delegated authority.\r\n\r\n- The partial loss of the  existing B1 office space on the site is acceptable because the host property  was originally buiilt as a town house not for uses within the B1 use class, the buildings are not therefore capable of holding a full range of B1 uses; do not have adequate loading facilities and the listed status of the site means that consent would not be given for internal alterations to open up the rooms. Furthermore the applicant has provided sufficient evidence to show that the site has been  unsuccessfully marketed as offices for a length of time. This is compliant with policy E4 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan 2002. It is also on balance consistent with policy CS13 of the Core Strategy 2012 and emerging policy DM31 of the the Development Management Policies June 2012 Submission.\r\n \r\n- The proposal subject to conditions wil restore historic and architectural features of the Grade II listed town house and as a result will benefit the special significance of this building and have a positive impact on the character of the streetscene and  the surrounding Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area.  The development is in accordance with the NPPF policies: 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011 and policies: D1, D3, D4, D5, D20, D22,  and D24 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002.\r\n\r\n- The resulting development is  considered to have an acceptable impact on neighbouring residential amenity in terms of: access; privacy; outlook; visual amenity; noise and nuisance.  The access to daylight and sunlight of adjoining properties is considered to be improved with the removal of the rear lower ground floor office and the reinstatement of the garden..  The development is in accordance with policies: 3.5, 7.6 and 7.15 of the London Plan, policy CS 9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011 and policies: Env1, Env17, D3 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 which seek to ensure that new developments do not have an unacceptable impact on existing/future residential amenity.\r\n\r\n- The proposed density of the development is considered to be appropriate given the siteâ€™s location, its context and the overall quality of the proposal.  The proposed dwelling mix within the Residential Accommodation is considered to be acceptable and would provide for housing that would go towards meeting identified need within the borough.  The development therefore complies with policies: 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 of the London Plan 2011, policy CS 12 of the Islington Core Strategy and policies: D3; H14, H15 of the Islington UDP 2002.\r\n\r\n-\tThe resulting residential accommodation is considered to be of an appropriate standard, quality and amenity.  The development is in accordance with policies: 3.5 of the London Plan 2011, CS 12 of the Islington Core Strategy and policies: H3; H7; H10 of the Islington UDP 2002 which seek to secure a high standard of new residential accommodation and residential amenity."
