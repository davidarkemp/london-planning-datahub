    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, with associated increase in chimney height would fail to respect the unity and rhythm along the roofline in which the host building sits. The detailing of the windows would also fail to respect the host building and wider terrace. The development would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing building (at the front and rear), nearby properties, and the wider Arlington Square Conservation Area. The development is therefore contrary to PPS 5, 7.6 of London Plan 2011, CS 9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011,  Policies D4, D11,  D22 and D25  of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Arlington Square Conservation Area Design Guidelines and section 2.4 of the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
