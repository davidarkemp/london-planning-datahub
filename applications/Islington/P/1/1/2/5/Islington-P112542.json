    "REASON : The proposed extension given its scale and location is considered to have an unnaceptably harmful effect on the residential amenities of properties to the north of the site.  This harm is considered to be provided by the proposal and the existing enclosed built environment and the distance between the affected units and the site building.   Insufficient evidence has been submitted within the proposal to demonstrate that the proposal will safeguard the amenities of occupants of neighbouring residential properties with respect to light provision in addition to the harm caused on outlook and the undue sense of enclosure provided.  The proposal in this regard is considered to fail to comply with policy D3 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and Section 1.6 of the Islington Planning Standard Guidelines 2002."
