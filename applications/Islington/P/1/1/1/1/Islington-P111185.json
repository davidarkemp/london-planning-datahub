    "REASON: The erection of a bin store platform, alterations to existing railings and the insertion of new railings at front ground floor level to the front lightwell, by reason of loss of historic fabric, plan form and negative impact on the external appearance of the Listed Building and New River Conservation Area, would be visually intrusive, result in the loss of historic fabric and be harmful to the streetscene, New River Conservation Area and the Grade II Listed Building. The proposal is contrary to Strategic policy 9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies D4, D11 and D8 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, guidance contained within the New River Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006 and the guidance contained in London Terrace Houses 1860-1660."
