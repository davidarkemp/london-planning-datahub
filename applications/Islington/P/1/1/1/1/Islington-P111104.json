    "REASON:  The proposed development by virtue of its height, scale, mass, bulk and materials would have an adverse impact on the building itself, the surrounding streetscene, the character and appearance of the Rosebery Avenue Conservation Area, the locally listed buildings nearby and the setting of the neighbouring grade II listed buildings known as 45-57 Mount Pleasant. The proposal is contrary to PPS5, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011) and the adopted SPG ‘Conservation Area Design Guidelines’."
