    "CONDITION:  The D1 (non-residential institutions) floorspace shall be strictly limited to uses within Use Class D1(c) for the provision of education.  No planning permission is hereby granted for purposes within Use Class D1(a,b,d,e,f,g,h) of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Class) Order 1987 as amended 2010 (or the equivalent use within any amended/updated subsequent Order).  \r\n\t\r\nREASON:  It is considered that the operation of an alternative D1 use in this location may have impacts, which should be subject of public consultation and a full planning application.  The application has been submitted and considered on the basis of supporting information specific to a identified user for the provision of education.   The restriction of the use invokes the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 and would ensure compliance with policy D3 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
