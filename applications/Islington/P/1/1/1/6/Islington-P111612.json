  "description": "Section 73 application to vary the wording of condition 11 (construction management plan) of  P100557 for \"Development of 22-24 Highbury Grove involving the demolition of existing buildings (except 24 Highbury Grove) and construction of new buildings for commercial use (Use Class B1) and 72 residential units of flats and townhouses.\".  The proposed amendment to the wording of the condition is \" No development shall commence until details of a phasing and construction management plan for the site, including works to Aberdeen Lane, have been submitted to the Local Planning Authority.  No part of the residential buildings hereby permitted shall be occupied until the approved works to Aberdeen Lane have been fully implemented and no development shall take place except in accordance with the approved phasing and construction management plan unless approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The details approved by the Local Planning Authority on 21st March 2011 pursuant to condition 11 of planning permission P072654 are deemed to be approved for the purposes of the condition.\" The effect of the amendment is that the developers will be able to commence the residential element of the scheme prior to the completion of the works to Aberdeen Lane and that the restriction on the occupation of the commercial premises until  the completion of the works to Aberdeen Lane, will be removed.  The applicant has also requested that the details in the construction management plan already agreed by the Planning Committee on 21st March 2011, are viewed as having satisfied this amended condition.",
