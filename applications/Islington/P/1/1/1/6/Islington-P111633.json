    "REASON: By virtue of their position the proposed chimney shrouds are considered to undermine the strong parapet line of the original building and would introduce features that detract from the design, appearance and architectural character of the locally listed building to the detriment of the Highbury Fields Conservation Area.  In addition, the proposed chimney shrouds visible from the street would contravene  section 5.13 of the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) which stipulates that the Council is opposed the erection of radio or satellite equipment at roof level which can be seen from the street, including long views from the side streets.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with PPS 5 (Planning in the Historic Environment), policies C17, D4, D11 and D22 of the Islington’s Unitary Development Plan (2002); policy CS9 of the Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
