    "REASON: The retention of the roof extension is considered to be unacceptable by reason of its inappropriate design, finishing materials, massing and poor fenestration patterns would represent a discordant and visible feature when viewed from the public and private realm. The development is therefore considered to have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host building, its setting along Caledonian Road and its wider setting within the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The proposal is contrary to policy 9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials), D25 (Roof extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington Urban Design Guide 2006, conservation guidance note 10 and PPS 5."
