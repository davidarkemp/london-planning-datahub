    "REASON:  The extension by reason of its bulk, scale, poor design and inappropriate relationship to neighbouring properties would result in a significant and unduly dominant building, harmful to the character and appearance of the established Lambton Road and Mews street-scenes, the Victorian terrace row to which it is attached and the architectural composition/design of the building which it extends. The proposal is contrary to policies: Env17, D4, D5, D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, policies: CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies: 7.6 and 7.15 the London Plan 2011 and the Islington Urban Design Guide."
