    "REASON: The proposed display of signs at various locations around Charterhouse Square associated with three parking ticket machines by virtue of their number, size and high visibility would have a serious detrimental impact on the setting of the Grade I Statutorily Listed Charterhouse building and Charterhouse Square and the Grade II listed gates at the entrance of the Square as well as the surrounding Grade II listed buildings on the Square which as result will not preserve or enhance the appearance of the Charterhouse Square Conservation Area. It is therefore contrary to Government Guidance as set out in PPS 5 (Planning in the Historic Environment) and policies 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, CS 8 and 9 of the Core Strategy 2011, ENV9, ENV10, ENV11, D4,  D11, D22 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and Conservation Area Design Guidelines SPG (2003)."
