Any foundation depths for the new development must be adequate to accommodate the existing tree in  the front garden of the site. The approved scheme shall be implemented and permanently retained thereafter.\r\n\r\nREASON To ensure that the development does not jeopardise existing trees and their future mature growth potential and to comply with the requirements of Env 6 (Trees)."
