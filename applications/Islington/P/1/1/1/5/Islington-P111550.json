    "The proposed second floor rear extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, height and bulk would form a discordant rear addition which would undermine the existing unified appearance to the rear of this section of the terrace. The development would fail to be a subservient feature when read towards the rear of the host building and wider terrace.  The proposed rear extension is considered to have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and its wider setting within the terrace and conservation setting. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy 9 of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, D4 ( Urban context), D11 ( Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials), D28 (rear extensions)  of Islington’s Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington’s Urban Design Guidance 2006 and PPS 5."
