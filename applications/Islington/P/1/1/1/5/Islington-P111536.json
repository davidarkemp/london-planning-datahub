    "REASON: The proposed cabinet, by reason of its location being in close proximity to an established tree on the footway, would unacceptably reduce the width of the footway on this section of the pavement, and therefore could prejudice pedestrian safety and the free movement of pedestrians. The development is therefore contrary to Policies Env9 (Street Furniture, Paving and Streetscene), D3 (Site Planning), and C17 (Telecommunications equipment) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
