    "REASON: The full-height side extension is overly dominant and breaks the symmetry of the pair of the semi detached villas and would block the view of green and open space behind which will have a detrimental impact on the spatial quality of the streetscape and surrounding Hillmarton Conservation Area.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of the Islington Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D5 (Townscape), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D26 (Side Extensions) of Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002); Policies 7.4 (Local Character), 7.6 (Architecture), 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology); the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2002) and the Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
