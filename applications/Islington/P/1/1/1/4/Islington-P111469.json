    "REASON: Due to its high visibility from views opposite and down St Paul’s Road, the proposed mansard roof extension would contravene the guidance contained in Section 8.14 of the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines which stipulates that roof extensions or party wall alterations on parapet roof which are visible from public views will not be permitted.  The proposal would further fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.2 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by disrupting the largely unaltered roofline of the terrace, to the detriment of the appearance of the surrounding Canonbury Conservation area.  The proposal would be further contrary to policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy (2011); policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extension) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the objectives of the Islington Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
