    "CONDITION:  Planning permission is hereby granted on a personal basis and shall operate for the benefit of  Family Mosaic only and shall not operate for the benefit of the land nor any other  person/company having an interest therein. \r\n\r\nOn the cessation of the personal planning permission hereby granted the handrail shall be removed and the original condition of the building prior to the\r\ngrant of this planning permission shall be reinstated and maintained as such thereafter.\r\n\r\nREASON:  The council in determining the planning application consider that permission should only be granted subject to its limitation on a personal basis.  It is considered that the grant of planning permission on a non-personal basis may be harmful to the historic character and appearance of the host building and surrounding Canonbury Conservation Area.  The limitation of planning permission ensures compliance with PPS 5 and policies CS 9 of the Core Strategy 2011, D3, D8 and D11, The Conservation Area Design Guidelines SPG and section 57(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)."
