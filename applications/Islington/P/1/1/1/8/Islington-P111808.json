    "REASON: The proposed drawings have a number of omissions which introduces considerable doubt as to the ultimate position, scale, design and appearance of the railings and gates. As far as can be assessed the additions constitute obtrusive development adding visual clutter to the properties frontage and disrupting the historic streetscape and rhythm of properties within St John's Grove contrary to policies D3, D4, D8, D11, D22, D23, D24 and D31 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002); Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011; Policies 7.6 and 7.8 the London Plan 2011 and the Islington Urban Design Guide."
