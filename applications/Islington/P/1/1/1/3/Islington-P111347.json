    "REASON: The proposed step-up of the roof of the side extension above ground floor level would be an incoherent and visually awkward element, and the proposed circular window on the front elevation would be incongruous, bearing no relationship to the fenestration or composition of the Locally Listed Grade B Building. The proposed extension would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the Locally Listed Grade B Building, street scene and wider Barnsbury Conservation Area. The development is contrary to policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions); D22 (New Development), D27 (Side Extensions) and D42 (Buildings on the Local List) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006), policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), and PPS5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
