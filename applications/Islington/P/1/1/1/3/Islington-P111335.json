    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would be situated within a terrace that has a uniform and predominantly unaltered roofline, and by reason of its design, size, form, and location, would be harmful to the architectural integrity of the Grade II Listed Building, and would be an overdominant and incongruous element within the terrace, disrupting its rhythm and unity. The development is contrary to policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development), D24 (Materials) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006), policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, and PPS5: Planning for the Historic Environment."
