    "REASON: The external roller shutters by reason of their form and location, being highly visible and visually awkward would detract from the architectural character of the host building and the streetscene to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding Chapel Market/ Penton Street Conservation Area.  The external roller shutters are thus contrary to policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of Islington Core Strategy (2011); policies  D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D13 (Shopfronts) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the provisions of the Islington Shopfront Design Guide (2003) and the Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
