    "REASON: By virtue of its size, position and materials the proposed roof extension would be harmful to the character and appearance of the building and the part of the terrace in which it is situated and would fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.2 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by disrupting the largely unaltered roofline of the terrace, to the detriment of the appearance of the surrounding Sotheby Road Conservation area.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy; policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extension), D24 (Materials) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the objectives of the Islington Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
