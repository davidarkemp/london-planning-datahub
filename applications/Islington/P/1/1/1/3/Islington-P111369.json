    "REASON:  The proposed development would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the area.The proposal conflicts with Policy 7.4 (Local Character) of the London Plan 2011 through failing to have regard to the pattern and grain of the urban structure, with Policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 through its unsympathetic scale and appearance, and with saved Policies D1 and D5 of the adopted Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 , insofar as these policies seek to ensure that development is appropriate to the form and character of its surroundings and the streetscape."
