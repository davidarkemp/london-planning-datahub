    "REASON: By virtue of its design and location the one-sided roof extension would spoil the architectural character of the villa and would have an impact on the quality of the public realm.  Overall, the proposal would fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.3 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by undermining the symmetry of the original building.  The proposal would conflict with policy C9 of the Core Strategy (2011); policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
