    "REASON: The proposal for a front lightwell and a second line of railings to the front garden would result in an incongruous addition to the front of this dwelling house and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, the terrace  to which it forms part, the St George's Avenue streetscene and the conservation area. This conflicts with policy PPS5: Planning for the Historic Environment, Policy (2010), CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy (2011) and policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D29 (Basements) and D31 (Boundaries) of Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and 2.4.6 of Islington’s Urban Design Guide (2006)."
