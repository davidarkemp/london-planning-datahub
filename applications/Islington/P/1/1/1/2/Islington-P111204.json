    "REASON: The property forms part of a terrace without front basement lightwells and sitting behind a modest planted front garden area. The excavation of the bulk of the front garden area to create a basement-level lightwell would form an incongruous and harmful feature  out of character with the original property, and with the terrace within which it is situated and would  result in the loss of a verdant front garden which forms an important  characteristic of the street. It would therefore be contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2011, Policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, Policies D3, D4, D5 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and policy 2.4.6 of the Islington Urban Design Guidelines."
