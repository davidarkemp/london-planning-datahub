    "REASON:  The proposed residential accommodation would result in the loss of a B1 use floorspace that is capable of being used for the full range of B1 uses on grounds of accessibility, size and location. The premises are also suitable for small firms and business start-ups. Furthermore, insufficient evidence of an unsuccessful B1 marketing campaign was provided. The application is therefore contrary to policy E4 (Loss of Business Use) and E13 (Protection of premises for small firms and opportunities for business start-ups) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and CS13 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011)."
