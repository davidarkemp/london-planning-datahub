    "REASON: The operation of the proposed chiller units and stabilised power generating equipment, together with the requirement to access the site for emergency repair and servicing of the data storage units, chiller units or power generators at unpredictable and unsocial times, has the clear potential to cause detriment to the amenity of residents of properties backing onto the site by virtue of noise, light-spill and disturbance. The proposal would therefore conflict with the objectives of Policy D3 and Env17 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, which resist developments likely to cause noise, disturbance or other nuisance for neighbouring occupiers."
