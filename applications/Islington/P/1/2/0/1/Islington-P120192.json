    "REASON: By virtue of its size, position, design and appearance the proposed rear dormer extension would be harmful to the architectural character of the building and would fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.2 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by dominating the rear roof slope, to the detriment of the appearance of the building and  the surrounding area.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2011), policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy; policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extension) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
