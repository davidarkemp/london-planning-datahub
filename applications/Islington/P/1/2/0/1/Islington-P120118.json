    "REASON: The addition of new storey on the rear projection would in itself be a radical departure from the existing character of the Ambler Road terrace, and the jarring effect of it would be exacerbated by its proposedtimber-clad finish and large horizontal picture window, which have no connection with the established appearance of the original terrace properties. The proposal disregards the design principles set out in Section 2.5 of the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006 (endorsed under the terms of Policy CS9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 201), which seek not to disrupt a consistent arrangement of rear projections on a largely-unaltered terrace and would conflict with Policy D4 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, which seeks to ensure that alterations and extensions are appropriate to their context and Policy D11 of that Plan, which looks for alterations and extensions to have regard to the materials and architectural detailing of the original property."
