    "REASON: The proposed retention of the second floor rear roof terrace and associated ballustrading by reason of inappropriate design, scale, massing and prominent location would form an overdominant and visually discordant feature to the rear elevation to the detriment of the character and appearance of this locally listed building, the wider row of buildings to which it forms part of and the Hillmarton Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy 9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) D24 (Materials) of Islington’s Unitary Development Plan 2002, Hillmarton  Conservation Guidance Note, Islington’s Urban Design Guidance 2006 and the NPPF 2012."
