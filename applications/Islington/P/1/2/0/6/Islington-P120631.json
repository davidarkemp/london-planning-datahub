    "REASON:  The proposed dormer to the rear roof slope, by reason of its bulk, scale, design, appearance, and choice of materials would introduce an incongruous and dominant feature to the building harming the historic form, design and appearance of the existing locally listed building and would neither preserve or enhance the New River Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials), of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and the New River Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
