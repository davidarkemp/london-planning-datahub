The proposal is contrary to policies 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture), and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011; policies CS7 (Bunhill and Clerkenwell) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011; and policy Env11 (Advertisements and Signs) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 together with national guidance provided in the NPPF."
