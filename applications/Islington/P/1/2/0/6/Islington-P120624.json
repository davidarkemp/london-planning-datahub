    "REASON: The two proposed air conditioning units and associated cabling to be attached to the façade of the building fronting Crawford Passage, by reason of its high visibility, visual clutter and harm to a uniform and clean building façade would harm the appearance of the existing building, the street scene, and would neither  preserve or enhance the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policies CS7 (Bunhill and Clerkenwell) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials), of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, emerging policies DM1 (Design) and DM3 (Heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies Submission Version 2012, Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
