    "REASON: The replacement windows and door, by reason of their inappropriate design and material, would disrupt the uniformity and consistent character and appearance of the locally listed host building and streetscene and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area. This proposal is therefore contrary to policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials) and D42 (Buildings on the local list) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, policy 12 of the NPPF 2012, policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy 2011 and the objectives of the Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Islington Design Guide 2006."
