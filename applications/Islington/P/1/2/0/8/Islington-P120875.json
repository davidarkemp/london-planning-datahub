    "The proposed roof extension, by reason of its bulk, scale, design, and appearance, would introduce an incongruous feature to the building and terrace that is visually prominent within the street scene and surrounding area harming the historic form, design and appearance of the existing locally listed building, the street scene and would neither preserve or enhance the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to part 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the NPPF 2012, policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D25 (Roof Extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
