    "REASON: The proposed additional floor introduces a visually dominant and incongruous form of development and fails to respect the architectural character and detail of the adjoining buildings by virtue of its size and bulk. The development would be highly visible from the street/public realm and would be harmful to the design and appearance of the host building and the street scene. It would neither preserve nor enhance the Barnsbury Conservation Area contrary to policies D4, D11 and D22 of the UDP 2002, policy CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006 and policies DM1 and DM3 of the (Proposed Submission) Development Management Policies."
