    "REASON: The proposed first floor rear extension by virtue of its inappropriate design and appearance would form an incongruous and discordant feature when viewed from the private and public realm. The development would fail to respect its context and would create a visually harmful development which would have a detrimental visual impact on the character and appearance of the host building and its setting within the terrace. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS8 of the Core Strategy, policies D4, D11 and D22 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and section 2.5 of the Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2006."
