    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by virtue of its inappropriate design, scale positioning and massing would form an over dominant and discordant feature when viewed from the private realm. The development would fail to respect its context and would create a visually harmful development which would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host locally listed building. The proposal is therefore contrary to CS policy 9, policies D4, D11, & D42 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2006, St Johnâ€™s Grove conservation guidance note and section 12  of the NPPF 2012."
