    "The proposed solar panels would represent an incongruous feature at roof level, which would disrupt the roofline of the grade II listed terrace and would be visible in views along Great Percy Street and Holford Street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host Grade II listed building and the adjoining Grade II listed terrace. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policy7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011 and  policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011."
