    "REASON: The proposed development of the site for visitor accomodation would prevent it from providing employment as envisaged by policy CS13 (Employment Spaces) of the Core Strategy 2011.  The proposed visitor accomodation outside of a designated town centre would also introduce an incompatible use into a designated commercial/industrial area (Brewery Road/Vale Royal Industrial and Warehouse Area) and would be prejudicial to the continued operation of neighbouring commercial and industrial uses.  The proposed development is considered contrary to policy CS13 (Employment Spaces) and CS14 (Retail and Services) of the Core Strategy 2011 and the general aims of policies E7 (General Industrial Use) and E8 (Storage and Distribution) of the Unitary Development Plan 2002."
