    "REASON: The proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of  materials, design and appearance and be out of scale, excessively high and unsympathetic to the subject building and sits uncomfortably with the neighbouring properties. The two and three storey additions fail to respect the established building heights and would be incongruous with the area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.4 (Local Character), Policy 7.6 (Architecture) and Policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan (2011); policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of the Islington Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D5 (Townscape) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
