    "REASON: The proposed design is considered unacceptable by virtue of its height, scale, mass and bulk, given the existing context and its position between properties on Fonthill Road and Lennox Road. Also, the form and detailing of the design including window size and position, and materials is considered to bear no relationship to the surrounding context. This would be contrary to policies D4, D5 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), policies CS2.F and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), and sections 2.1-2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
