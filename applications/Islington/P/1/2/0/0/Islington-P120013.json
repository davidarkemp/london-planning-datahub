    "REASON: The proposed rear infill extension by reason of its excessive depth, height and position at the boundary of the site would be out of scale and character with the host building and surrounding area and would as a result detract from the amenities of no. 24 Thorpedale Road by reason of the proposal's overbearing appearance and an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal is therefore contrary to CS 9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy 2011, D3 (Site Planning), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) The Islington Urban Design Guidelines SPG (2006) and Planning Standards Guidelines SPG (2002)."
