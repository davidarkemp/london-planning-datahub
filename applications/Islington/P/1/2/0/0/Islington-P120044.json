    "The proposed solar panels would represent an incongruous feature at roof level, which would disrupt the roofline of the grade II listed terrace and would be visible in views along Great Percy Street and Holford Street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host Grade II listed building, the adjoining grade II listed terrace and the surrounding New River Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments), 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture) and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011; policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011; policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), and D24 (Materials) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002; and the relevant guidance contained in the Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
