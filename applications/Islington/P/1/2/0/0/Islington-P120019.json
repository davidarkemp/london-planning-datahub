    "REASON:  The proposed works would adversely affect the special architectural and historic interest of the listed heritage asset by virtue of their harm to the historic plan form, the loss of original fabric and the deleterious impact upon both the historic fenestration pattern and the integrity of the rear elevation. The proposals would therefore conflict with Policies HE9 of Planning Policy Statement 5 (Planning for the Historic Environment), with advice set out in the Historic Environment Planning Practice Guide, with Policy 7.8 (sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2011 and with Policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, together with the expectations of Policy D28 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002"
