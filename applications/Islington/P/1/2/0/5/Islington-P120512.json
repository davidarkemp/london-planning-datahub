    "REASON: The proposal by virtue of its height, position, bulk and design would result in the loss of the butterfly roof profile at the rear and have an overall adverse impact on the appearance of the host Grade B locally listed building, harmfully unbalancing the rear elevation of the terrace to which it forms a part. It will therefore cause harm to the architectural character and detail of this locally listed building, the terrace in which it is situated and as a result will be harmful to the appearance and character of the Arlington Square Conservation Area contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 of Islington’s Core Strategy (2011), policies: D4, D11, D24 and D25 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, the Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington’s Urban Design Guidelines 2006."
