    "The proposed extension to the second floor flat over the existing flat roof rear extension is considered to represent an incongruous form of development which would detract from the appearance of the building and disrupt the character and development pattern of the terrace which it forms a part of. The proposal in this regard is considered unacceptable and would fail to comply with D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D28 (Rear Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy (2011); and 2.5 of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
