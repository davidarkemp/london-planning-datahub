    "REASON: The proposed works by virtue of the loss of the existing garage/stable building and the impact of the proposed five-storey building and the new glazed ground floor extension (by virtue of height, bulk and specific design), would adversely affect the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and wider conservation area. This would be contrary to policy 12 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D3, D4, D5, D11, D22 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), emerging policies DM1 and DM3 of the Development Management Policies Submission Version (June 2012) and guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
