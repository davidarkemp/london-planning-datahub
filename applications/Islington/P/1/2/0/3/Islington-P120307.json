    "REASON: The proposed erection of a full width three storey rear extension by reason of its design, height, scale, bulk and massing  is considered to form an overdominant and harmful development.  The proposed development would visually dominate the host building to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace, streetscene, and is considered to neither preserve or enhance the Rosebery Avenue Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policy 9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials), D28 (Rear extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Rosebery Avenue Conservation Guidelines."
