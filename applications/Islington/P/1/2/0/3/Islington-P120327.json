    "REASON: The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal provides the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing, through submission of an inadequately evidenced financial viability statement. In particular its weaknesses lie in lack of evidence supporting build costs, estimated sales values and existing use value. The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan policy 3.12 and Islington Council Core Strategy Policy CS12."
