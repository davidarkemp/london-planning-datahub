    "REASON: The proposal, due to the proximity of the proposed solid privacy screen to windows to habitable rooms and the first floor rear roof terrace at 10 Friend Street, would result in unacceptable harm to the amenity of the occupiers of 10 Friend Street as a result of an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. Therefore, the proposal would conflict with policy 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS12 (Meeting the housing challenge) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, and policy D3 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the guidance contained in the Islington Planning Standards Guidelines SPG and the NPPF."
