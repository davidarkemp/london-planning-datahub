    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, as a result of its excessive height, bulk, massing and design would represent an incongruous feature, which would cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host building, the integrity of the terrace of which it forms part and the character and appearance of the Moorfields Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to the guidance provided in section 2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002); together with policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), and D25 (Roof Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002); policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments), 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture), and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan (2011) and emerging policies DM1 (Design) and DM3 (Heritage) of the Development Management Policies Submission Version (June 2012)."
