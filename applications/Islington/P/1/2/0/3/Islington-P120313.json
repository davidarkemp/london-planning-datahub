    "REASON: The replacement of single pane glass with double-glazed window panes on the eight sash windows on the front elevation of the property by virtue of their unsympathetic design and thickness significantly harms the character and appearance of the original building, the character and integrity of the terrace which it forms a part of and the character and appearance of the East Canonbury Conservation Area.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy (2011); policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002); and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
