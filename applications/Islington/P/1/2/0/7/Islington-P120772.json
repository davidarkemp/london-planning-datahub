    "REASON: By virtue of its size, position, design and inappropriate materials the proposed roof extension UPVC dormer windows and rooflights would be harmful to the character and appearance of the locally listed building and the part of the terrace in which it is situated and would fail to comply with the Conservation Area Design Guide which stipulates that no front dormer extensions are permitted at this location.  The proposal would also be contrary to the principles laid out in section 2.4 of the statutory Urban Design Guide by disrupting the unaltered roofline of the terrace, to the detriment of the appearance of the surrounding Newington Green Conservation Area.   The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy; policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extension), D24 (Materials) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the objectives of the Islington Conservation Area Design Guide (2002), and the provisions of the NPPF."
