    "REASON: The proposed flagpole antenna, equipment cabinets and associated equipment by reason of their inappropriate design, scale, height and siting in a prominent location would form a dominant and visually harmful development. The proposed development is therefore considered to have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host locally listed building and short, medium  and long views into the application site within its setting within the St Mary Magdelene Conservation Area. The development is considered to be contrary to policy 9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), St Mary Magdelene Conservation guidance note, section 2.6.3 of the Islington Urban Design Guidelines (2006) and The NPPF 2012."
