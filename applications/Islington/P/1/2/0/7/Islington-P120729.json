    "REASON: The retention of the 2 no. pole mounted and 1 no. wall mounted antenna, by reason of their size, siting and prominent location have an adverse effect on the skyline, represent incongruous and dominant features that are detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and wider character and appearance of the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Road Conservation Area. The development would be contrary to policy CS9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), D4 (Designing in Context), and D11 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), and section 3.14 of the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
