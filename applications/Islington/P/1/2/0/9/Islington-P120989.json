    "REASON: The proposed equipment cabinets and pole, due to their size, siting, visibility and appearance, will be incongruous features that are detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene and conservation area. The development is therefore contrary to policies Env9 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), C16 (Public Utility Apparatus), C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), section 2.6.3 of the Islington Urban Design Guidelines (2006) and the Barnsbury Conservation Area Guidelines."
