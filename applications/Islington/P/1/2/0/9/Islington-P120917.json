    "REASON: The proposed cabinet, by reason of its scale, design, siting and prominent location would be an incongruous feature that would have a harmful impact upon visual amenity and would fail to relate positively to the adjacent building of architectural merit or the boundary railings. The cabinet would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding Barnsbury Conservation Area contrary to policies D8 (Boundary Walls, Paving, and Street Furniture), C16 (Public Utility Apparatus), C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), T47 (Streetscape) and Env9/Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and Streetscene) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and guidance contained within Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
