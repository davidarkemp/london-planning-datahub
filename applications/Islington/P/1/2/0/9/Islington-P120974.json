    "REASON: The proposed dwelling, by virtue of its orientation as a north facing single aspect unit, the provision of a habitable room with no window, the poor quality rear access, and the lack of provision of any external amenity space or cycle storage, would provide unacceptable substandard residential accommodation, which would provide an inadequate standard of amenity for future occupiers. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments) and 7.3 (Designing Out Crime) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 (Protecting Islington's built and historic environment) and CS12 (Meeting the housing challenge of the Islington) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies H3 (New Housing and Changes of Use to Residential), H7 (Standards and Guidelines), H10 (New Development), and D3 (Site Planning) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the guidance contained in the Islington Planning Standards Guidelines SPG and the NPPF."
