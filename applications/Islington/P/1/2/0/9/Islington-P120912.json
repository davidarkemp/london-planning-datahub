Therefore, the proposal would conflict with policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islingtonâ€™s built and historic environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, emerging policy DM3 (Heritage) of the Islington Development Management Policies (Submission June 2012), and policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2011, together with national guidance provided in the NPPF."
