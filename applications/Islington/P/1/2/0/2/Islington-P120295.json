    "The proposed mansard roof extension would significantly disrupt the consistency of the front and rear roofline of the host terrace (particularly between property numbers 24 to 30 even), its impact would be compounded by high visibility from the front, side and rear in views from Linton Street, Union Square and Bevan Street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host locally listed building, the adjoining locally listed terrace and the surrounding Arlington Square Conservation Area. The proposal is contrary to the guidance provided in chapter 2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide, and paragraph 4.8 (ii) (& iii) of the Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines; together with policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D25 (Roof Extensions), and D42 (Buildings on the Local List) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002; policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011; and policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments), 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture), and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011."
