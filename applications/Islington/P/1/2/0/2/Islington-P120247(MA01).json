    "CONDITION: Planning permission for the Class B8 use is hereby granted on a personal basis and shall operate for the benefit of Royal Mail Group Limited and any associated companies and any successors to the business of Royal Mail Group Limited only and shall not operate for the benefit of the land nor any other person/company having an interest therein. \r\n\r\nOn the cessation of the personal planning permission hereby granted the building and land shall revert to the use/purpose for which it was normally used prior to the grant of this planning permission.\r\n\r\nREASON: The council in determining the planning application consider that permission should only be granted subject to its limitation on a personal basis, in view of the nature of the proposed occupier and their specific requirements in terms of delivery and servicing. It is considered that the grant of planning permission on a non-personal basis may cause harm. The limitation of planning permission ensures compliance with policies: 6.7 and 6.13 of the London Plan 2011, policies: Env17, E7, E8, E9, D3, Env17, T15 and T55 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and section 57(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)."
