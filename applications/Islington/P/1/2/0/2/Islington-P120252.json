    "REASON: The proposed rooflight, by virtue of its prominent and high level location on the main south roofslope would be highly visible in views along Dartmouth Park Hill and Bredgar Road and would cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding St John’s Grove Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments), 7.4 (Local character),7.6 (Architecture), and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011; policies CS1 (Archway) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011; and policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D25 (Roof extension) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002; together with the guidance provided in the Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines SPG and Section 2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide SPD."
