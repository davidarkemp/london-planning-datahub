It would be contrary to policies 7.4 (Local character) and 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2011, policies C17 (Telecommunications Equipment) and D4 (Designing in Context) of the Unitary Development Plan 2002, section 2.6.3 (Telecommunications Aerials and Equipment) of the Islington Urban Design Guide and policies DM1 (Design), DM3 (Heritage) and DM7 (Telecommunications and Utilities) of the emerging Development Management Policies June 2012, and guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guidelines 2006 and St. Luke's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
