    "REASON: By virtue of its size and position the proposed rear dormer extension would be harmful to the architectural character of the building and the part of the terrace in which it is situated and would fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.2 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by disrupting the largely unaltered roofline of the terrace, to the detriment of the appearance of the surrounding area.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy; policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extension) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) & Emerging Development Management Policy DM1."
