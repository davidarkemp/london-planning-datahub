    "REASON: Due to size and scale the proposed extension at rear second floor level would result in the construction of an over dominant structure which would fail to conform to the scale and height of the original building.  The large extension would also detract from the uniformity of the wider terrace which is largely undeveloped at rear second floor level. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the NPPF, policies D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), draft policy DM1 and DM3 of the Development Management Policies (Submission 2012), policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011) and the objectives of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
