    "REASON: The proposed external cladding would result in the loss of the existing historic features (stucco render to the ground floor of the elevations, with facing brickwork above, traditional moulded window surrounds, and front parapet cornice detailing) on the host building, resulting in a loss of the existing continuity within the terrace and the streetscene, and resulting in significant harm to the character and appearance of the historic Victorian host building and terrace of which it forms part. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments), 7.4 (Local character), and 7.6 (Architecture) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islingtonâ€™s built and historic environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Unitary Development Plan 2002, and emerging policy DM1 (Design) of the Islington Development Management Policies (Submission June 2012)."
