    "REASON: The proposed residential accommodation will result in the loss of commercial floor space contrary to policies E4 (Loss of business use) and E13 (Protection of SME’s) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and policy CS 13 of Islington’s Core Strategy and Emerging DM policy 31. No substantive marketing evidence has been provided to justify the loss of the existing employment space. The proposed development would also cause the loss of premises well suited to occupation by small firms, and would therefore adversely affect the prospects for new and growing enterprises in the Borough contrary to policy E13 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
