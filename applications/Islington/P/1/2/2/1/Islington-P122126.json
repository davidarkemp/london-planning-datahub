  "description": "Minor alteration to previously advertised development involving the removal of 16 existing garages onsite and not 14 as previously advertised. \r\n\r\nNew description: Demolition of 16 brick garages and their replacement with a secure storage compound housing steel storage containers variously holding communications/data storage equipment, a generator and equipment for providing a stabilised power supply, along with three banks of free-standing chiller units with acoustic enclosures.  Erection of a 2 metre high steel mesh security fence slightly set back from the perimeter of the compound, with screening planting of mature trees between the fence and the boundary of the site. \r\n(This is a resubmission of a similar application dismissed at appeal; the current development seeks to mitigate potential noise impacts of the development. All previous correspondence received by the council relating to this application will be fully considered as the case move forwards for decision)\r\n[Full planning application ref: P122125 also submitted]\r\nThis application may affect the character and appearance of the conservation area.
