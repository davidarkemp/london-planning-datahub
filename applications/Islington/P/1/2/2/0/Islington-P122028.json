    "REASON: The proposed development, by reason of its size, siting, visibility and appearance, would contribute to visual clutter and be detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene and fail to either preserve or enhance the surrounding conservation area. The proposed development is contrary to policies 7.4 (Local character) and 7.5 (Public Realm) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies Env9 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), C16 (Public Utility Apparatus), C17 (Telecommunications Equipment) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, policies DM3 (Heritage) and DM7 (Telecommunications and Utilities) of the emerging Development Management Policies 2012 and guidance contained within the Islington Streetbook SPD 2012 and Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
