    "REASON: The proposed telecommunications equipment cabinet, due to its inappropriate siting, design and appearance, would result in unnecessary additional visual clutter, which would result in unacceptable harm to the setting of the adjacent Grade II buildings and unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding New River Conservation Area. This is contrary to policies 7.4 (Local character) and 7.5 (Public Realm) of the London Plan 2011, policies CS7 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies Env9 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), C16 (Public Utility Apparatus), C17 (Telecommunications Equipment) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, policies DM3 (Heritage) and DM7 (Telecommunications and Utilities) of the emerging Development Management Policies 2012 and guidance contained within the Islington Streetbook SPD 2012 and Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
