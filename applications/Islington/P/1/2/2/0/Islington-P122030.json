    "REASON: The proposed development due to its size, siting, visibility and appearance, would be an incongruous feature detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene and would neither preserve nor enhance the surrounding conservation area.  The proposed development is contrary to chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policies 7.4 (Local character) and 7.5 (Public Realm) and 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2011, policies Env9 and Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), C16 (Public Utility Apparatus), C17 (Telecommunications Equipment) and D4 (Designing in Context) of the Unitary Development Plan 2002, section 2.6.3 (Telecommunications Aerials and Equipment) of the Islington Urban Design Guide and the Islington Streetbook and policies DM1 (Design) and DM3 (Heritage) of the emerging Development Management Policies 2012."
