    "REASON:  The proposed telecommunications equipment cabinet, due to its siting, design and appearance, would result in unnecessary additional visual clutter, which would result in unacceptable harm to the setting of the adjacent Grade II listed building and the character and appearance of the surrounding Barnsbury Conservation Area.  The proposed development is contrary to policies 6.10 (Walking), 7.4 (Local Character) and 7.5 (Public Realm) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011 and policies C16 (Public Utility Apparatus), C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Street Scene), T46 (Design Issues), T47 (Streetscape) and T49 (Mobility and Sensory Impairment) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, the Islington Streetbook SPD 2012, the Conservation Area Design Guidelines and policies DM3 (Heritage) and DM7 (Telecommunications and Utilities) of the emerging Development Management Policies 2012."
