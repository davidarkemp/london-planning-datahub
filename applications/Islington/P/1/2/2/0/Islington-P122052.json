    "No consent is granted for the proposed 2 no. projecting banner signs. The banner signs are located at first floor level and therefore contrary to guidance in the Islington Shopfront Design Guide (2003) and by failing to be sensitive to the visual appearance of the building in relation to their siting and causing unsightly proliferation and clutter of signage, the proposed banner signs fail to accord with parts B(i) and B(ii) of emerging policy DM6 of the Islington Development Management Policies (Submission Version) 2012.\r\n\r\nConsent is granted for the new replacement fascia sign and the ornate hanging sign subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nCONDITION: Any advertisement displayed and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a clean and tidy condition to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nCONDITION: Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a safe condition. \r\n\r\nCONDITION: Where an advertisement is required under these Regulations to be removed, the removal shall be carried out to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nCONDITION: No advertisement is to be displayed without permission of the owner of the site or any other people with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission. \r\n\r\n CONDITION: No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of any road traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or so as otherwise to render hazardous the use of any highway, railway, waterway (including any coastal waters) or aerodrome (civil or military).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the approved fascia signage, the already installed fascia board is larger on site than as shown on drawing LPD56128-23 Rev C submitted with the application, and as such the as built fascia sign is not in accordance with the permission hereby approved."
