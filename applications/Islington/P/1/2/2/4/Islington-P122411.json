    "The proposed roof extension, due to its excessive height, scale, bulk and massing, would represent an anomalous feature in the streetscene, which would fail to respect the consistent contextual building height and the uniformity of the local townscape context, disrupting the existing unity of the otherwise consistent roofline along Hornsey Road. As such, the proposal would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the streetscene and would cause unacceptable harm to the setting of the adjacent locally listed building at 297 Hornsey Road. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments), 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture) and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, emerging policies DM1 (Design) and DM3 (Heritage) of the Islington Development Management Policies (Proposed Submission June 2012),Para 2.2.2 and 2.4.2 of the Islington Urban Design Guide, and national guidance contained in the NPPF."
