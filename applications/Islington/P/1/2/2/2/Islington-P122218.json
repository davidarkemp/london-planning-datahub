Consequently no marketing evidence has been provided to demonstrate there is no realistic prospect of the unit being used as a Public House in the foreseeable future.  The proposed alternative use will detrimentally affect the vitality of the area and the character of the street scene and the conservation area. The proposal constitutes the loss of a service of particular value to the local community. The proposal would be contrary to policy 4.8 (supporting a successful and diverse retail sector) and policy 7.1 (building Londons neighbourhoods and communities), and DM27 of the emerging Development Management policies June 2012."
