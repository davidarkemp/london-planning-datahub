    "REASON: The proposed mansard roof extension by virtue of its design, appearance and loss of the original roof form would be harmful to the architectual character and integrity of the host building, streetscene, wider Duncan Terrace Conservation Area and setting of Listed Buildings. The mansard roof extension would be contrary to Policy D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of Islington’s Unitary Development Plan (2002) and Policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Sustaining and Enhancing the Significance of Heritage Assets) of the London Plan 2011, Policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM1 and DM3 of the Emerging Development Management (Submission Version) June 2012."
