    "REASON: The proposed advertisements, by virtue of their size, design, prominent location and method of illumination would be harmful to and undermine the architectural integrity of the host building, which is Grade II listed, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host building, the streetscene and the surrounding New River Conservation Area. The proposal is contrary to policies 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture), and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policy Env11 (Advertisements and Signs) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002,  emerging policies DM1 (Design), DM3 (Heritage), and DM6 (Advertisements) of Islington's Development Management Policies Document Submission Version 2012, together with national guidance provided in the NPPF."
