    "REASON: The almost complete infill of the space between the rear of Mackenzie Road and Westbourne Road is inappropriate in townscape terms, suburban in scale and the low height of the new building would sit uncomfortably with its three storey Victorian neighbours. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 and D5 of the UDP 2002, emerging Development Management (2012) policy DM1A, and policy 2.2.5 of the Urban Design Guidelines 2006."
