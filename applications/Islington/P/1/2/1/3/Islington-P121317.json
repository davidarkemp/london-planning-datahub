  "description": "The proposal is for a new two storey building, ground and lower ground containing 4 x self contained 1bed units. There are 2 flats at garden level and 2 flats accessed from a new stair down to a new excavated basement level. The building is a discreet garden pavilion style building which reads as a separate single storey building from the street, only partially viewed above the existing garden wall. All units have a combined kitchen/living/dining space with a separate bedroom and bathroom. The new building is located to the rear of the main house in the existing tarmac'd yard. The proposal involves the demolition of the modern single storey existing annexe building. There is a new landscape proposed to the rear garden with grassed area to the front of the new building and a new tree and flowe bed. The units are within the existing use class C3. [Full planning applciation ref: P121316 also submitted]",
