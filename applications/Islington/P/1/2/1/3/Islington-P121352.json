    "REASON: The proposal provides an unacceptable standard of residential accomodation by virtue of the poor floor to ceiling heights; the excessively small size and cramped layout of the three-bedroom flats; single aspect nature of the one-bedroom flats; the habitable room windows on the boundary of the site overlooking neighbouring gardens and properties and the provision of oblique views from the bedroom of the first floor flat in block 1 into the living room of the first floor flat in block 2 and vice versa. The development is therefore contrary to the NPPF, policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2011, policies D3, H3 and H7 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, policies CS9 and CS12 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM11 and DM12 of the emerging Development Management Policies 2012 and guidance provided in the London Design Guide Interim Edition 2010."
