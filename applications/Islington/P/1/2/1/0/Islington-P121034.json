    "REASON:  The proposed erection of a two storey rear extension by reason of excessive scale, bulk, massing, materials, design and appearance is considered to be an overdominant form of development which would bear no relationship to the existing scale and context of the host building and would result in the loss of the majority of an original rear facade.  It would also neither preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area contrary to policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) and D28 (Rear Extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006, the Arlington Square Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the National Planning Policy Framework 2012."
