    "REASON: By virtue of its size, position, design, appearance, use of inappropriate materials and the loss of the butterfly roof profile the proposed roof extension and the associated roof terrace would be harmful to the architectural character and integrity of the original building and the part of the terrace in which it is situated.  The proposed roof extension would also fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.2 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by disrupting the largely unaltered roofline of the terrace, to the detriment of the appearance of the wider terrace.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy; policies D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extension) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
