    "REASON:  The proposed residential accommodation would result in the loss of  B2 use floorspace that is capable of being used for the full range of B2 uses on grounds of accessibility, size and location. The premises are also suitable for small firms and business start-ups. Furthermore, no evidence of an unsuccessful marketing campaign has been provided. The application is therefore contrary to policies E7 (General Industrial Use) and E13 (Protection of premises for small firms and opportunities for business start-ups) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002; CS13 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and DM31 of the emerging Development Management Document."
