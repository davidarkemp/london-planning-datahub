    "REASON: The proposed mansard roof extension and balustrade, by virtue of their size, position, design and materials would fail to be subordinate to the main building and be harmful to the appearance of the host building and undermine the unity of this section of the residential street with a consistent roofline to the detriment of the quality of the public realm.  In addition, the proposal would fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.3 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by undermining the symmetry of the original building.  The proposal would also conflict with the NPPF (2012); policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011); policies D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002); and emerging policies DM1 and DM3 of the Development Management Policies Submission Document (2012)."
