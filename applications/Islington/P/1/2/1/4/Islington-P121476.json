    "CONDITION:  The retention of the building hereby approved is granted only for a limited period, being until  29th March 2013, on or before that date the building and all its associated/ancillary goods shall be dismantled and removed from the site and the land shall be reinstated to the condition as evident prior to the erection of the temporary building hereby approved or another condition as agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nREASON:  The temporary building is such that the Local Planning Authority is only prepared to grant permission for a limited period in view of the special circumstances of this case. The limitation of the consent period ensures compliance with policies: CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011) and policies Ed5, D3, D4, D11, D22 and D24 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and section 57(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)."
