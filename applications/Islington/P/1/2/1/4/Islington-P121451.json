    "REASON: The proposed development is considered to be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, the adjoining terrace properties and wider Highbury Fields conservation area. In particular this includes the unacceptable alterations to the design and height of the roof, the replacement of the brick front elevation with stained black timber cladding above ground floor, and the replacement and insertion of new contemporary style windows. The proposal is considered to cause unacceptable harm to the historic character of the host building and existing terrace, and disrupt the unity of the residential terrace which this property forms a part of. The proposal is hereby contrary to policy CS8 (Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy (2011); policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials) and D25 (Roof extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), policies 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
