    "REASON: The retention of the third floor roof terrace together with associated ballustrading and access staircase by reason of their inappropriate design, scale, massing and prominent location results in an overdominant and visually discordant feature to the front and rear elevation to the host building to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building, the setting of adjoining listed buildings and the wider New River Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy 9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) and D22 (New Development) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 New River Conservation Guidance Note, Emerging Development Management Policies DM1 & DM3 (June Version 2012), Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2006 and The NPPF 2012."
