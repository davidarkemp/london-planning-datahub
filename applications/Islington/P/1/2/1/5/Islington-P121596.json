    "REASON: The proposed change of use to day caf√©/takeaway (A3/A5) would result in the loss of office (B1) use floorspace that is capable of being used for a range of B1 uses on grounds of accessibility, size and location. The premises are also suitable for small firms and business start-ups. Furthermore, insufficient evidence of a suitable marketing campaign has been provided to the Local Planning Authority. The application is therefore contrary to policy E4 (Loss of Business Use) and E13 (Protection of premises for small firms and opportunities for business start-ups) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and CS13 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), and policy DM31 (Loss of existing business floorspace) of the emerging Development Management Policies submission version (2012)."
