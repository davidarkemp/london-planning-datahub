    "The filling in of the vaults will render them inaccessible and therefore will cause harm to the historic plan form of the basement area and remove access to an historic space which forms a significant part of the historic development of the property. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that there are no viable alternative methods of stabilising the vaults and that the proposed infill will adequately secure the long term stability of the vaults and allow for future removal of the infill material and reinstatement and re-use of the space. The proposal would therefore adversely affect the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building contrary to paragraph 134 of policy 12 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2011 and policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and London Terrace Houses 1660-1860"
