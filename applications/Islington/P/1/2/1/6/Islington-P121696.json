    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would be situated within a locally listed terrace that has a uniform and predominantly unaltered roofline and by reason of its size, form and location, the extension would be an overdominant and incongruous element within the locally listed terrace, disrupting its rhythm and unity. The proposed extension, by reason of its design and appearance would be out of character with the existing building and Arlington Square Conservation Area, visible from the public realm (canal towpath and street level views) harming the architectural integrity of the host building and the character and appearance of the Arlington Square Conservation Area. The development is contrary to policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development), D24 (Materials) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011."
