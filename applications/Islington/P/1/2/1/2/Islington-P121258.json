    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would be situated within a terrace that has a uniform and predominantly unaltered roofline and by reason of its design, scale, form and location would be an overdominant and incongruous element within the host terrace, disrupting its rhythm and unity. The proposed extension, by reason of its design and appearance would be harmful to the appearance of the host building, integrity of the terrace of which it forms part and to the character and appearance of the Angel Conservation Area and would be contrary to policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development) and D25 (Roof extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002), emerging policies DM1 and DM3 of the Development Management Policies Submission Version (2012), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and The NPPF 2012."
