    "REASON: The proposed garden building, by virtue of its location at the rear of the garden, its excessive size, poor design, solid appearance and inappropriate materials, would represent an incongruous feature within the context of the surrounding townscape and cause unacceptable harm to the appearance of the site and the character and appearance of the Tollington Park Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments), 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture), and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies H6 (Garden land), D4 (Designing in Context), D5 (Townscape), D22 (New Development) and D24 (Materials) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002; emerging Islington Development Management policies DM1 and DM3 (Proposed Submission Version June 2012) and guidance provided in the Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
