    "REASON: The proposed telecommunications pole, equipment cabinet and meter pillar, by virtue of their size, siting, visibility and appearance, will be incongruous features that are detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene and would neither preserve or enhance the surrounding conservation areas. The development is therefore contrary to policies Env9 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and the Streetscene), C16 (Public Utility Apparatus), C17 (Telecommunications Equipment), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), section 2.6.3 of the Islington Urban Design Guidelines (2006)."
