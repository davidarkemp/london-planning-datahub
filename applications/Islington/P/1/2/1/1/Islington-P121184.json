    "REASON: The proposed rear dormer extension would be harmful to the the terrace in which it is situated and would fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.3 of the Urban Design Guide (2006) by disrupting the largely unaltered roofline of the terrace, to the detriment of the appearance of the surrounding area.   The proposal would further have an adverse impact upon the quality of the public realm, particularly when viewed from Balfour Road.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy; policies D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extension) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, and the Councils Urban Design Guidelines 2006 (section 2.4.3)."
