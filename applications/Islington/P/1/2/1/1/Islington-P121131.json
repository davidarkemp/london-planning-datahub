    "REASON: Due to scale, height, design and appearance, the heightened wall is considered inappropriate to the approved scheme and fails to respect the scale, form and character of the adjoining terrace along Caledonian Road to the detriment of the Barnsbury Conservation Area.  The proposal would therefore conflict with The NPPF (2012); Policy CS9 of the UDP; Policies D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002; Policies DM1 and DM3 of the emerging Development Plan Document (2012), and with the design guidelines set out in the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
