    "REASON: The proximity of the proposed house to the rear of 80 and 82 Aubert Park would cause harm to living conditions at the proposed dwelling and the amenities and living conditions to these neighbouring residential properties in relation to privacy, light, outlook and an increased sense of enclosure.  The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, with the provisions of Policies D3 (Site Planning) and H3 (New Housing) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and with the linked provisions of the Islington Planning Standards Guidelines 2002."
