    "REASON: The proposed railings, by virtue of their inappropriate detailing and proportions, would be an incongruous addition to the inappropriate front boundary wall and would harm the significance of the heritage asset without clear or convincing justification. The proposed works are, therefore, contrary to Policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Sustaining and Enhancing the Significance of Heritage Assets) of the London Plan 2011, Policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D8 (Boundary walls, paving and street furniture), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D22 (New development) and D31 (Boundaries) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, emerging Development Management Policies DM1 (Design) and DM3 (Heritage), and the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
