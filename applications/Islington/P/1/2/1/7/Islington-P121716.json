    "REASON: The proposed roof alterations by reason of its design and appearance would introduce an incongruous feature to the building and terrace that is visually prominent from the rear elevation harming the historic form, design and appearance of the existing locally listed building, the roofscape uniformity of the existing terrace, and would neither preserve or enhance the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to part 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the NPPF 2012, policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D24 (Materials), D25 (Roof Extensions), and D42 (Buildings on the Local List) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, emerging policies D1 (Design) and D3 (Heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies Document Submission Version 2012, Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
