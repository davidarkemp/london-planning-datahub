    "REASON: The loss of the butterfly roof form and the proposed mansard roof extension would be harmful to the architectural character and integrity of the locally listed building and would disrupt the uniformity of the largely unaltered terrace to the detriment of the wider Barnsbury Conservation Area.   Due to its visibility from the public realm the proposed mansard roof extension would contravene the guidance contained the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) which states that roof extensions or party wall alterations on parapet roof which are visible from public views will not be permitted.  The proposal would also fail to comply with the NPPF (2012), Policy CS12 of the Core Strategy (2012), policies D3, D4, D11 and D25 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), draft policies DM1 and DM3 of the Development Management Policies (Submission Document 2012).  The proposal would be further contrary to the objectived of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
