    "CONDITION:  The D1 use of the ground floor of the building hereby approved is granted only for a limited period, being until 01 December 2014, on or before that date the temporary use shall cease. \r\n\r\nOn the cessation of the temporary use hereby granted the building and land shall revert to the use/purpose for which it was normally used prior to the grant of this planning permission.\r\n\r\nREASON:  The temporary use is such that the Local Planning Authority is only prepared to grant permission for a limited period in view of the special circumstances of this case.  The limitation of the consent period ensures compliance with policies: E4 (Loss of Business Use) and E13 (Protection of Premises for Small firms and Opportunities for Business Start-Ups) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002; policies CS6 (Kings Cross) and CS13 (Employment spaces) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011; policies 2.10 (Central Activities Zone – Strategic Priorities), 2.12 (Central Activities Zone – Predominantly Local Activities), 4.1 (Developing London’s Economy), 4.2 (Offices), and 4.3 (Mixed Use Development and Offices) of the London Plan 2011; and emerging policies DM20 (Location and concentration of uses), DM30 (New Business Floorspace), and DM31 (Loss of existing business floorspace) of the Islington Development Management Policies (Submission June 2012) and section 57(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)."
