    "REASON: The proposed telecommunications flagpole/mast, due to its siting, design and appearance, would result in unnecessary additional visual clutter which obtrusively breaks the skyline and would result in unacceptable harm to the visual amenity of the streetscene and the adjacent East Canonbury and Arlington Square Conservation Areas.  This is contrary to policy D22 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and emerging policies DM1 and DM3 of Islingtonâ€™s Development Management Policies Document Submission Version 2012."
