    "REASON: The proposed demolition of nos 89 and 91 Highgate Hill would result in the loss of two buildings of historic importance dated from the 19th Century in addition to a locally listed shopfront, which positively contribute to the character of the Highgate Hill/Hornsey Lane Conservation Area. Therefore the proposed demolition would be contrary to Policy D20 of the London Borough of Islington adopted Unitary Development Plan (November 1994) and the London Borough of Islington Unitary Development Plan First Review, Second Deposit version, June 2000."
