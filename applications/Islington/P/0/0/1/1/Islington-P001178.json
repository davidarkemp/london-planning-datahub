    "1. This prior approval determination does not cover the antenna as the requirement for a prior approval determination is not necessary for that aspect. If it had been the Local Planning Authority would have been minded to require prior approval and refuse, due to the visibility of the front antenna from the street. \r\n\r\n 2. If more than 3 antenna are proposed in the future, then planning permission would be required. Your attention is also drawn to the requirement of Condition A.2(1) of Part 24 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 in relation to the antenna."
