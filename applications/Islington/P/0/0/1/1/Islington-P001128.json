    "The proposal is considered to be grotesquely out of scale with immediate and surrounding buildings both in terms of height and general bulk. The existing buildings on the site, particularly those in Sun Street, form an important part of the view out of Finsbury Square. The poor design proposed of the replacement building would not justify the loss of these historic buildings. \r\n\r\n The proposal would result in a major detrimental impact on southern Islington and the City fringe and would seriously harm the hierarchy of spaces in the area. Principally, the overpowering height would adversely impact on the important set piece of Finsbury Square. \r\n\r\n For these reasons, this Authority objects to the proposal."
