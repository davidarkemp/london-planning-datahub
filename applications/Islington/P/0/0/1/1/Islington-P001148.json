    "This Authority objects to the proposals as currently submitted for the following reasons:- \r\n\r\n These are buildings that should be retained. Their loss would have a substantial detrimental impact on the character of the Kings Cross Conservation Area. The complete gutting and removal of roofs threatens their loss, however well supported, particularly with a railway running beneath. \r\n\r\n Less internal demolition might be acceptable. It is presumed that the existing buildings, with some modifications, would be capable of continued economic use. Retention and re-use of the existing buildings should be the priority. \r\n\r\n In visual terms, loss of chimney stacks would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene and the wider Conservation Area, as would loss of the building/ elevation at the eastern end of the site on the Pentonville Road frontage. This lower building is architecturally part of the main facade and its loss is not justified by the gain of one extra floor. \r\n\r\n Roof extensions should not be visible from the street and in long views. This should be demonstrated. \r\n\r\n The works amount to substantial demolition in terms of DETR Circular 14/97 (Appendix E). Conservation Area Consent is also required."
