    "This Authority advises that the proposals raise a wide range of complex issues for Camden and English Heritage. The two most relevant to Islington are the impact on traffic during the construction period and possible displacement of traffic into the Borough and access for people with disabilities to the permanent works. \r\n\r\n With regard to traffic, the Council will shortly be responding to London Underground's Traffic Management Plan and have requested that the issue be discussed at the St. Pancras Forum on 15th February, 2000. \r\n\r\n Access for people with disabiliites to the Victoria and Piccadilly lines before Phase II works are completed remain a concern. However, the Council relies on Camden Officers to ensure that the details of Phase I works ensure that they are as accessible as possible and meet all relevant guidelines and standards."
