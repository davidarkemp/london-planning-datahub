    "REASONS:1. The proposed demolition of all the existing building except the facade conflicts with the Unitary Development Plans strategic objective for design in conservation areas which is 'to conserve and enhance areas of special architectural or historic interest as key elements of Islington's character'. \r\n\r\n 2. The proposed demolition does not retain the integrity of the existing 19th century building, contrary to Unitary Development Plan policy D20 and the East Canonbury Conservation Guidelines and no special circumstances exist which would warrant the demolition. \r\n\r\n 3. The proposed demolition is contrary to PPG15 Conservation Area Control over Demolition, especially sections 4.27 and 3.19."
