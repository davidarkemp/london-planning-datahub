    "CONDITION:  Notwithstanding the approved drawings the precise siting of the proposed ventilation chimneys shall be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority within 6 months of the date of this planning permission unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nREASON:  The precise internal engineering details of the ventilation equipment to be concealed underneath the decking area and connected to the ventilation chimneys, has not been finalised and therefore may need to be adjusted marginally.  Furthermore the re-siting of the ventilation chimneys further east would improve the visual appearance of the upper level of the Civic Space.  Further details are therefore required to ensure the proposed siting complies with policies D1, D3, D4, D7, and D10 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, and policy 4B.4 of the London Plan (2004)."
