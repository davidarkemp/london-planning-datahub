    "REASON: The proposed change of use from retail (A1 use class) to adult gaming centre (D2 use class) would result in the loss of a retail unit that would result in the loss of a former key local shop from this designated district shopping area. The proposed D2 use would adversely affect the vitality and viability of the area and the availability of shopping facilities and services available to the local population. The change of use would adversely affect the appearance and active frontage of Junction Road identified within the Archway development Framework as an important main shopping frontage within the area. The proposal would not be consistent with the local regeneration aims of the Council for the Archway area and would conflict with policies S16 (Protected Shopping Centres), S17 (Archway District Shopping Centre), S18 (Changes of Use from Retail) and S19 (Non-Retail Uses) of the Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Conservation Area Design Guidelines SPG (2002) and the Archway Development Framework SPD (2007)."
