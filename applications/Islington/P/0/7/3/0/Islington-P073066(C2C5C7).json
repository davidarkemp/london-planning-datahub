    "Please note that this decision notice does not constitute approval of details for condition 5 (public art). It is not considered that the chimneys in themselves represent public art in the manner envisaged by the condition. The wind mitigation screens, which it has been agreed will not be constructed at this stage, present an opportunity to incorporate public art. Although it is recognised that these will not be coming forward for the foreseeable future it was not considered appropriate to discharge this condition. Therefore, condition 7 is only considered partly discharged."
