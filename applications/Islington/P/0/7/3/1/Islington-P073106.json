    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, due to the resulting height of the altered roof and the long views afforded to the site from Alwyne Road and Alwyne Villa would harm the appearance of the Grade II Statutorily listed building, including the rhythm and unity of the terrace to which it is part. It would harm the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and would be contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of the Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and PPG 15 'Planning and the Historic Environment'."
