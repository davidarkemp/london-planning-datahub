This would accommodate 203sqm commercial use at lower ground and ground floor level, and 26 flats.  The commercial uses proposed are uses within either Classes A1, A2, B1 or D1 of the Use Classes Order (these are respectively retail, financial and professional services, offices, research and development, light industry appropriate in a residential area, or non residential institutions). This proposal may have an effect on the setting of the Grade II listed building opposite the site.",
