    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding the drawings hereby approved, the following details shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and permanently retained thereafter:\r\n\r\ni) provision of 15 secure and covered cycle parking stands (to replace the cycle parking to be removed)\r\nii) Installation of Tactile Blister Paving that is in line with the pedestrian pavement (as the current layout requires circuitous routes into the site, which require uphill movement)\r\niii) The Tactile Blister Paving around the zebra crossing should be no deeper than 2 x rows at 800mm to enable a level route behind and avoid a trip hazard.\r\n\r\nREASON: So that the Local Planning Authority is satisfied with the proposal in accordance with Policies Env13, Env14 and T46 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
