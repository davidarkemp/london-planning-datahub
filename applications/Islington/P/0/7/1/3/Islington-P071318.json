    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding the details shown on approved drawings 140/1.1 & 140/1.2, the dormer shall be formed to match closely in overall width & thickness of cheeks the design of the multi-pane sash dormers in the terrace groups at 33-39 & 41-47 Brooksby Street.\r\n\r\nREASON: The dormer treatment proposed on the drawings would have an excessively heavy surround & head, to the detriment of the appearance of the listed building. It & would introduce an additional dormer form to a terrace whose unity is already adversely affected by the facts that not all properties have an attic second floor & that  the design treatment of the attic storey varies considerably even for those properties that have one. Following the example of the dormer treatment on this nearby group of properties on the opposite side of the street would avoid further variation in attic storey treatment and in order that the Council may be satisfied with the finished appearance of the dormer window, so as to satisfy the requirements of policies D4, D11, D24 & D39 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
