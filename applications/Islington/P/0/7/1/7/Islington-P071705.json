  "description": "A full planning application has been received for the erection of temporary school accommodation during construction of a proposed school redevelopment scheme.  The temporary accommodation consists of the erection of two buildings which would be in place for up to 69 weeks.  The first would be a three storey administration building covering an area of 191 sq m, located to the east of the existing single storey music block.  The second building would comprise a four storey teaching building covering an area of 343 sq m, located to the south of the existing music block.  Total gross floor area of both buildings would be 1942 sq m.  Both temporary buildings would be nearer the Thornbury Square entrance to the site than the Hornsey Lane frontage.  The proposal involved the felling of two trees and works to others. The development falls within use class D1 (non-residential institutions).",
