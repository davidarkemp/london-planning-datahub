    "You are advised that Condition 24 is only partially discharged in that the number of lights, the location and the level of illumination are agreed. To fully discharge Condition 24, prior to the lights first operation, the applicant shall notify the Local Planning Authority when the lights are ready to be turned on and also submit a technical report on their effects on neighbours. This will enable a full assessment to be undertaken by the Local Planning Authority with a view to finally discharging the condition. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that in order to fully discharge Condition 24 of Planning Permission P051450, baffles may be required on the type AA lights. The type HH lights create a material impact on neighbours then they will only be permitted to be turned on when the building is in use."
