    "REASON: The proposed development would not provide an adequate standard of accommodation to future occupiers of the units (particularly flat A) within the development by creating unacceptable levels of daylight/ sunlight to habitable rooms, by failing to provide rooms of sufficient size, adequate storage areas and refuse storage areas, which would adversely affect the level of amenity that the future occupiers of the proposed units could reasonably expect to enjoy. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3, H3, H7 and H9 of the Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Islington Planning Standards Guidelines 2002."
