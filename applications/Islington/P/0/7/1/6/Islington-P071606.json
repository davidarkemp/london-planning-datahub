    "REASON: The proposed extension of the 1st & 2nd floors to the back line of the site would fail to respect the building line set by the overwhelming majority of the buildings in the terrace within which 144 & 146 are situated, including all of the immediately neighbouring buildings on both sides. The formation of a new roof storey also extending right to the back line of the site would involve the loss of the rear parapet form & fail to respect the original rear wall line of the terrace. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies D4 & D11 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 & with the design guidelines set out in the  \"Islington Urban Design Guide\" which was adopted by the Council as a Supplementary Planning Document in December 2006."
