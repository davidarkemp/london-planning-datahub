    "REASON: The proposed two storey side extension and fire escape stair by reason of its bulk, scale, massing and design and limited garden space available, would constitute an overbearing and dominant extension that would not respect the appearance of the listed building. It would not preserve the character or appearance of the Conservation Area and would harm the historic and architectural special character of the listed building. The proposal would be contrary to policies D1, D3, D4, D11, D22 and D27 of the Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Conservation Area Design Guidelines SPG (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guidelines SPG (2006)."
