    "REASON: The outlook from the proposed lower ground floor flat would be poor with the living-dining-kitchen being particularly severely enclosed as a result of the overhang of the upper ground floor. Daylight or sunlight to its living-dining-kitchen would be seriously limited by both the overhang & the degree of enclosure by the retaining walls of the patio area & by the party garden walls above them. The proposed flat would not provide an adequate standard of residential amenity & the proposed windows of the lower ground floor flat in the street elevation would be vulnerable to vandalism & break-ins. The proposal would conflict with Policies D3, Env12, H3 & H10 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
