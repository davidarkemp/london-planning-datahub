    "REASON: The change of use from A1 to A3 would result in the provision of an unacceptable number of retail units within the protected local shopping centre and a subsequent high concentration of food and drink establishments. This would affect the long-term viability and vitality of the protected shopping centre as well as conflicting with the Whitecross Street Improvement Project. The proposal is contrary to Policies S18 and S22 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, Whitecross Street Economic Study and the Policies for the New Deal for Communities."
