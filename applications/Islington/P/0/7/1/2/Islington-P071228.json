It is therefore recommended that you submit an application for retrospective planning permission or an application for a certificate of lawfulness whereby evidence will need to be submitted to prove to the Council that the unit has existed for a continuous period of at least 4 years. For further information please contact the case officer Matt Druce on 020 7527 2796."
