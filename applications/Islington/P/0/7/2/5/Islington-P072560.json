    "REASON: The proposed four storey rear extension by reason of its excessive height, would not respect the scale and appearance of the original building and as the roof would extend beyond the eaves line of the main roof it would disrupt the rhythm and unity of the terrace. As this site backs onto an area of open space, this would also be harmful to the character and appearance of the area, and contrary to policies Env1 (New Development), D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide SPG (2006)."
