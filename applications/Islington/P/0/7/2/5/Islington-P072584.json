  "description": "Removal of old air conditioning ducting, air conditioning units, cable track from main roof. Installation of new much smaller air conditioning units on the roof. The new units are not visible from the street and do not affect the roof line. The units are mounted behind the gables and are not visible. On the ground floor the main bulding entrance door has been replaced. The door frame has not been replaced but has been repainted dark grey from the old red colour. A new door has been made and fitted within the opening to comply with DDA requirements. This means that the door has been changed from two small equal size leaves to one larger leaf and a slave leaf. This is to allow wheel chair access. The door style is as the original but painted grey.",
