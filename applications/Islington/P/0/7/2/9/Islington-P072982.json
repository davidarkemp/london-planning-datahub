    "REASON: The proposed development, by reason of its excessive bulk and scale would not respect the scale, bulk and rhythm of development in the surrounding area. The proposal would dominate the appearance of the original building to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surroundings. The proposed new window in the side of the extension would result in significant loss of privacy and direct overlooking of habitable rooms. The scheme would be contrary to policies  Env1 & 2 (New Development), D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing on Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the Planning Standards Guidelines SPG (2002)."
