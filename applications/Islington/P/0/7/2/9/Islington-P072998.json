    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding the indications to the contrary on the approved plans, the projection of the extension from the main rear wall of the house shall not exceed 4 metres. \r\n\r\nREASON: An extension projecting further than 4 metres would produce a new room considerably larger in both its principal dimensions than the original front room of the house & with a footprint significantly out-of-scale with the host building. Restricting the overall projection to no more than 4 metres would avoid detrimental departure from the architectural character of the original house & fences would accord with the principles laid down in PPG15 (Planning & the Historic Environment) in relation to listed buildings."
