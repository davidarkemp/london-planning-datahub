    "REASON: The three roof lights proposed (partially complete) due to their inappropriate design and materials and raised position constitute an unsympathetic form of development that does not respect the special architectural and historic interest of the grade II statutorily listed building. The roof lights are harmful to the overall appearance of the building and also harm the setting of the adjoining grade II listed buildings within the terrace. The proposal is considered contrary to PPG 15 'Planning and the Historic Environment'."
