    "REASON: The proposed terrace at second floor level would comprise railings around the perimeter of the roof of the existing two-storey rear element and it is considered that the proposed roof terrace and associated railings and screening are unacceptable as they are prominent features positioned at the end of the terrace and visible from the rear elevation at Mercers Road. It is considered that the prominence of the proposed terrace detracts from the character and appearance of the subject property and the residential amenity of the surrounding area, contrary D1(Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and Env 17 (Protecting Amenity) of the Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Islington Urban Design Guidelines 2006 ."
