    "REASON: The construction of the proposed rear extension would involve building over around two-thirds of the existing rear garden area, & would represent adding approximately as much residential accommodation again as is currently contained within the main 1st & 2nd floors of the property. The resulting 4-bedroom maisonette in the extended 1st floor & ground floor rear extension would not have access to a garden of an adequate size"
