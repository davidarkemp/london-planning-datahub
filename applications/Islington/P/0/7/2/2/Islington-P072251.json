    "REASON: The ATM, by virtue of its location adjacent to the entrance to the shop, fails to present a safe and secure operating environment for its users and would impede access to the property.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), Env1 (New Developments), Env12 (Community Safety of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and 4B.5 (Creating an inclusive environment), 3A.14 (Addressing the needs of London's diverse population) of The London Plan (2004) and Planning Policy Statement 1 (Delivering Sustainable Development)."
