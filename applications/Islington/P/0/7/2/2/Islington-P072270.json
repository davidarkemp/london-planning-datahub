  "description": "To reinstall exterior metal stairs leading from the raised ground\r\n>floor to the garden, for which we have sole use.  The previous\r\n>leaseholder removed the steps as they were unsafe.  There is a door\r\n>leading out to where the steps were previously which has been poorly\r\n>secured and we are keen to reinstall these steps as a matter of urgency\r\n>as we have a three year old child.  The steps we propose to install are\r\n>in line with similar steps of the adjacent houses.  They will not\r\n>overlook or disrupt the enjoyment or use of adjacent properties.\r\n>\r\n>2.  To the front of the house there is an area under the from entrance\r\n>steps which was an old coal storage area. we intend to convert this to a\r\n>utility room.  We intend to install a small window which will look onto\r\n>our front garden.  There is no intrusion of privacy  into any of our\r\n>neigbours property with the installation of this window.  I understand\r\n>that a similar project has been undertaken a few doors away.\r\n>",
