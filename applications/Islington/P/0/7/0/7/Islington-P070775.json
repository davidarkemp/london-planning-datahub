  "description": "7 Ambler Road is a terraced three storey single family dwelling house. The house has been previously extended with a single storey extension to the rear. The proposed works are essentially an internal refurbishment of the ground floor of the property. It is not proposed to extend or alter the massing of the property. The only proposed external change is to the rear ground floor facade of the property, the garden side. It is proposed to increase the size of the doors to the garden and install a set of ppc aluminium framed folding sliding doors. The remaining brickwork on either side of the doors would be rendered.",
