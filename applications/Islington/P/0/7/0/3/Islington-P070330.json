    "The proposed three storey rear extension, by reason of its bulk, scale and massing would not respect the architectural character of the existing building. It would not appear subordinate to the main building and would dominate its rear elevation to the detriment of the appearance of the building and character of the area. The proposed extension would be contrary to policies D1, D3, D4 and D11 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the Urban Design Guide SPG (2006)."
