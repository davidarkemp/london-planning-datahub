    "You are advised that the Certificate of Lawfulness was refused because the proposed rear dormer does not constitute permitted development as it is located within a conservation area on article 1(5) land.   The rear dormer would require submission of a full planning application. However a resubmission for a certificate of lawfulness purely relating to the proposed ground floor extension would likely be granted by the Council, providing of course it meets the other criteria as set in Schedule, 2 Part1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995."
