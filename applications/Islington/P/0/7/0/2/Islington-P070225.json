    "The application has been refused on the grounds that the proposal would result in a loss of external amenity space for the occupants of this property.  The existing enclosure of the first floor terrace and the creation of the second floor roof terrace is an unauthorised amendment to the plans approved under ref. P022684.   A retrospective planning application is required in order to regularise these works including the screening around the parameter of the terraced area at second floor level. You are advised to contact the case officer, Matt Druce (020 7527 2796), following the receipt of this decision notice for advice on how to resolve this issue."
