    "The London Borough of Islington is disappointed that previous views have not been taken into account and  reiterates its objections to the proposed extension, refurbishment and alteration of King's Cross Station as previously set out in October 2006. In particular Islington objects to the lack of access to the station from the east side and to the proposed alterations to the front elevation including the installation of canopies. Objection is also raised to the loss of the porte cochere and the design of the rotunda.\r\nThe London Borough of Islington requests that it be involved in agreeing S106 heads of terms before negotiations begin with the developers.\r\nAs previously the views of the Kings Cross Conservation Area Advisory Committee are endorsed by the Council and the latest version is appended to this letter."
