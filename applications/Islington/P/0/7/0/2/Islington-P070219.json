    "The London Borough of Islington wish to object to the proposed development for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe tower is far too high and will have a harmful impact on the views from Finsbury Square, Bunhill Fields, HAC fields and is likely to also have a significant impact on other near, medium and long views from areas within the London Borough Of Islington. \r\n\r\nLBI have an application for Ropemaker Place and great care has been taken to ensure views of St Paul's are not impinged, including backdrops, and the same care should be taken with the Milton Court redevelopment.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no objection raised to the podium block, which would house the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the overall proposal is at an unacceptable scale and would result in paving the way for an undesirable cluster of super-tall buildings in this part of London."
