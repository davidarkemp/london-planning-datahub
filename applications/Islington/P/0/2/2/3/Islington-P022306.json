    "REASON:  Elements of the proposed roof extension and of the retaining party parapet wall with 14 Allingham Street would be visible in street level views from Allingham Street.  This would expressly conflict with the Design Guidelines for the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area which state that, apart from in a few specified locations not including Allingham Street, no roof extensions or associated party wall alterations visible from the street will be permitted.  The proposal would fail to preserve the appearance of the locally listed building and the wider conservation area and would conflict with Policies D19, D25 and D42 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
