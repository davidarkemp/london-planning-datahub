    "REASON: The Council are very disappointed at the lack of positive improvement on this scheme. The facadism with open plan behind would greatly change the appearance of the building. \r\n\r\n Given the very unusual structural qualities of the existing building, straddling the railway below, the Council queried the practicality of the proposals, as well as the erosion of the special character of the building. \r\n\r\n The Council disliked the roof alterations, particularly the loss of promient chimney stacks and the loss of the existing detailing at roof level. \r\n\r\n The Council conclude that a cellular use would be far preferable to open plan offices."
