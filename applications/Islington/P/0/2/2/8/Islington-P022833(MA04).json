    "REASON:  The proposed relocation of the gate 18m within the site would result in an unfortunate break in the front boundary treatment to the detriment of the character and appearance of the resulting development and the Westbourne Road streetscene.  The alteration is considered to form a material change to the approved plans and elevations and therefore is not minor in nature."
