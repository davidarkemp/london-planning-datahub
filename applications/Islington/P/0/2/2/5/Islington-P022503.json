    "The ground floor premises subject to this application were formerly used as a newspaper publishing office which falls within Use Class B1 (Business) of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) and not Use Class A2 (Financial and Professional Services) of the same Order as claimed by the applicant. In these circumstances, the Local Planning Authority does not consider that the authorised use of the premises falls within Use Class A2 and it would not therefore be appropriate to issue a Certificate of Lawfulness for A2 Use."
