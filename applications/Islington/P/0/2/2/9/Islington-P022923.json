    "CONDITION:\r\n\r\n1.  The refusal notice refers to the address of the appeal property as 264-265 Upper Street.  At the Hearing, it was confirmed that the restaurant had been extended into the basement of No. 264 and that planning permission had been granted for this use.  I have considered the appeal on this basis.\r\n\r\n2.  The condition in dispute includes a limitation on opening hours to between 1000 and 2230 on Sundays and Bank Holidays.  The application subject to appeal seeks an extension of the opening hours on Sundays and Bank Holidays from 23.00 to 01.00 the following day.  At the Hearing, the appellant confirmed that an extension from 22.30 to 01.00 the following day was sought.  I have considered the appeal accordingly.\r\n\r\n3.  Certificate B confirmed that notice of the applications had been given to Mr. Mustafa Eshref, an owner of the land, on 28th November 2002.  However, the appeal documentation included Certificate A confirming that nobody but the appellant was the owner of the land.  This discrepancy had not been resolved prior to the Hearing, but the appellant confirmed that that Mr. Eshref is the landlord and that he was aware of the appeal.  The submission of the incorrect certificate with the appeal form was a mistake.  As the Council had no objection to the Hearing proceeding and there were no objections from Mr. Eshref at the application stage, I considered that no interests would be harmed by continuing to hear the appeal.\r\n\r\n4.  A separate condition was made in 2002 for an extended music and dancing licence.  This appeal relates only to the refusal of planning permission for the proposed development under planning legislation."
