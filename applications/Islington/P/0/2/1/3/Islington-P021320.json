    "REASON: At present the extension at the rear of the property greatly alters the form and appearance of the back of the building, to its detriment. The proposed rear dormer would exacerbate this situation so that little of the original built form at the third floor and at roof level would be retained, when viewed from the rear. This would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the building, which is Locally Listed (Gd C) and would also affect the character and appearance of the terrace and surorunding area, which is part of the Tufnell Park Conservation Area. This would be contrary to Policies D1, D4, D22, D25 and D42 of the Unitary Development Plan (2002) and goes against Conservation Area Guidelines (11.19)"
