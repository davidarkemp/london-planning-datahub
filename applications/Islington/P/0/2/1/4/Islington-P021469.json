    "REASON: The Angel Baptist Church is included in English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register 2002. Separation of the meeting hall section from the main church, without linked proposals for restoration of the church and with loss of direct access to the boiler serving the church, would fail to safeguard the statutory listed building from further deterioration. It would prejudice the long term viability of the main church building as currently laid out and could lead to the Local Planning Authority coming under pressure to allow detrimental layout changes to facilitate long term active use of the main church building on a 'stand- alone' basis. \r\n\r\n The proposed self-containment and conversion would therefore conflict with the considerations on the use of historic buildings set out in both the June 2001 English Heritage Policy Statement on Enabling Development and paragraphs 3.8-3.11 of Planning Policy Guidance Note 15. It would also fail to satisfy the requirements of Policy D40 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
