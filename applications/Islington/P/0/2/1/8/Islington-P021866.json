    "REASON:  The proposed development is considered unacceptable in the interests of proposed residential amenity.  More particularly the proposed development would not provide an adequate amount and quality of natural light, outlook and privacy for those habitable rooms situated around the proposed lightwell.  In this respect the proposed development would be contrary to Policy H7 of the existing Unitary Deveopment Plan (2002) which requires appropriate accommodation and living standards in respect to dwellings and accompanying Supplementary Planning Guidance which aims to secure adequate and sustainable standards of amenity for the long term duration of its use."
