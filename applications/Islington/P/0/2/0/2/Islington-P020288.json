    "1] I would inform you that the plans submitted are inaccurate and cannot be read as it is not clear which plans show the existing telecommunication apparatus and which plans show works that are proposed. For example, the proposed southeast elevation (Drwg No. 30/GLN0572/05 Issue B) shows the 'proposed' cabinets. However, this does not 'marry-up'with the existing elevation (Drwg No.30/GLN0572/07 Issue A) as this drawing is a north-east elevation. Therefore, the siting and design of the existing cabinets cannot be compared to the siting and design of the proposed cabinets, which is a fundamental requirement when assessing telecommunication applications under the above mentioned Order. \r\n\r\n 2] In the event that you wish to resubmit a revised application, I would advise you to submit a set of drawings that are clearly labelled in terms of what works are existing and what works are proposed and ideally on separate sheets of paper at an appropriate scale of 1:100 and 1:50. Photos of the existing cabinets and a photo showing a typical example of the proposed cabinets would be beneficial to the application as it would be far easier to assess and determine whether prior approval regarding design would be required. \r\n\r\n 3] I advise that the case officer, John McRory would be happy to meet you and discuss this in more detail with a view to resolving this issue in order that you can submit a further revised application for consideration."
