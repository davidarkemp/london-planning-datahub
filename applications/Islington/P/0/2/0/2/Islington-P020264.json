  "description": "Tree works subject to TPO Canonbury No.6 1975. \r\n\r\n Front and rear garden tree works. \r\n\r\n Works:  T1 Lime:- \r\n\r\n 1.  Remove 75% of epicormic growth from the main stem and     primary branches retaining sufficient adventitious     growth along the vertical length of the structural limbs     of the tree to encourage and maintain active channels of     conductive tissue from roots to the aerial tips of the     crown.  These should be arranged in a spiral fashion     around the circumference of these main limbs and care     will need to be taken during climbing operations to     avoid excessive damage to the epicormic growth on the     upper sides of the limbs in particular. \r\n\r\n 2.  Reduce back limbs growing towards No.6 Canonbury Park     South.  As discussed, they should be reduced in length     back to branch junctions, to contribute towards the     overall aesthetic shape when the complete tree has been     pruned.  On no account should they be reduced back to     the main stems. \r\n\r\n 3.  Crown thin and crown reduce in conjunction to reshape     the tree, by the removal of a small proportion of     primary foliage bearing branches to subtly reduce and     thin the canopy.  The emphasis is to reduce back from     over the road growth that has reached out and not been     adjusted and balanced by previous thinning works.     Reduction in height should be kept to no more than one     metre maximum.  The Tree Surgeon is to concentrate on     the removal of 15 to 20% at most of the foliage bearing     branches which are to be pruned back to the best,     naturally occurring pruning points within the canopy,     such as branch unions and not straight back to growth     points as represented by buds or twigs. Such cuts are to     be made by the target pruning method and according to     BS3998. \r\n\r\n T3 Ash \r\n\r\n 1.  Reduce in length branch towards north east with decay at     base.  On no account is the branch to be cut back to the     main stem. \r\n\r\n 2.  This consent rem",
