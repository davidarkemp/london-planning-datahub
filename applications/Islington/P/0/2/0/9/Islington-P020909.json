    "REASON: The proposed development is considered unacceptable in the interests of visual amenity. More particularly the proposed development by virtue of its bulk and visibility from public space to the rear and parts of Percy Circus would represent an intrusive visual element which would be out of keeping with the appearance of the property and those surrounding terraced properties currently unimpaired by roof extensions and retaining much of their original character at roof level. In this respect the proposed development would be contrary to policies D1 and D25 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan. Furthermore, if permitted the development would harm the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to policy D22 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan and relevant Conservation Area Guidelines, which the Council considers desirable to preserve and enhance in compliance with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990."
