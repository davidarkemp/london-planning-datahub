    "REASON: The proposed flats would provide a poor standard of residential amenity by virtue of being located at back edge of pavement on a very busy road and with no external area for respite and ventilation at the rear, and with the areas shown as bedrooms having poor light & outlook by virtue of being fitted only with a single roof light. The units would fail to satisfy the requirements of Policy H3 (New Housing and Changes of Use to Residential) and H7 (Standards and Guidelines) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
