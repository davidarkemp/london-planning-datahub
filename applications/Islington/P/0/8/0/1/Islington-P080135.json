    "REASON: The features introduced into the Mall in the late 1970s, (including the sub-division of the ground floor and basement into small unit shops and the creation of linear public thoroughfares or malls between shops linking the entrances to north and south), are important elements in the history of its conversion from a closed industrial building to a shopping arcade with small unit shops open to the public and a shopping thoroughfare forming part of the public realm during shopping hours.  They are also important integral elements in the character of the building as a Grade II listed shopping arcade.  The proposed alterations would involve the loss of these features and with them the established character of the building as a shopping arcade and would thereby seriously detract from the historical and special interest of the building as converted to that use."
