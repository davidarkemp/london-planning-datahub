    "NUISANCE FROM CONSTRUCTION WORK \r\n\r\n Nuisance from demolition and construction works is subject to control under the Control of Pollution Act 1974. The normal approved noisy working hours are 08.00 to 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and 08.00 to 13.00 Saturdays with no working on Sundays or Bank Holidays. You are advised to consult the Council's Assistant Director (Public Protection), 3rd Floor, 222 Upper Street, N1 1YA or to seek prior approval under Section 61 of the Act if you anticipate any difficulty in carrying out construction other than within normal working hours and by means that would minimise disturbance to adjoining premises."
