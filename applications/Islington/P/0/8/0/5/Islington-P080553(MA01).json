    "REASON: The proposed non-material amendments are considered to be material insofar as they introduce new window openings, additional roof level amenity space and result in the reconfiguration of internal layouts, all of which necessitate consultation and formal assessment against planning policy and guidance. Further to this, the proposed amendments relate to all levels of the building and are beyond the scope of the planning permission reference P080553 which relates to the third floor and roof level only."
