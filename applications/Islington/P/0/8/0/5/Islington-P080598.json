    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding the drawings hereby approved, no consent has been granted for the location of the vertical Soil and Vent Pipe in duct  and the installation of new wall panelling (Labelled 'Vertical S&VP in Duct' on Drawings PL01, PL02 and PL03) in the rear family room, ante room, library, dressing room and bedrooms (located at basement, ground, second, third and fourth floor levels). It is considered that this element of the scheme, in its current format, would harm the internal historic fabric and special interest of the Listed Building. \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution should be devised for the installation of the proposed soil and vent pipe. Details of which shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to any works commencing on this particular element of the scheme.\r\n\r\nREASON: To preserve the historic fabric of the building in accordance with PPG 15 \"Planning and the Historic Environment\"."
