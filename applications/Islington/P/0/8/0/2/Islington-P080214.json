    "REASON: The proposed rear extension at first floor level and roof terraces and timber screens by reason of the resulting bulk and scale of development at first floor level and having regard to the pattern of development within the rear of this terrace, would constitute an obtrusive form of development that would not be sympathetic to the appearance of the existing building, or the terrace as a whole. Due to the visibility of the rear of the site these works would harm the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The proposed first floor rear extension and roof terrace screens would be contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development) and D28 (Rear Extensions) of the Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006), along with PPG 15 'Planning and the Historic Environment'."
