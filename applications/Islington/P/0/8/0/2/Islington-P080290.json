    "INFORMATIVE: It is not ideal for building directly onto a tunnel shaft area and I would recommend the Developer discuss the proposal with Network Rail's Tunnel Engineers.  In addition, we would request that the following points are taken into account:\r\n \r\nMethod statements will be required to be submitted to Network Rail's Territory Outside Parties Engineer at the below address for approval prior to works commencing on site.  Where any works cannot be carried out in a \"fail-safe\" manner, it will be necessary to restrict those works to periods when the railway is closed to rail traffic which must be booked via Network Rail's Territory Outside Parties Engineer and are subject to a minimum prior notice period for booking of 20 weeks.  \r\n \r\nAll excavations/earthworks carried out in the vicinity of Network Rail property/structures must be designed and executed such that no interference with the integrity of that property/structure can occur.  If temporary works compounds are to be located adjacent to the operational railway, these should be included in a method statement for approval by Network Rail.   \r\n \r\nNetwork Rail is required to recover all reasonable costs associated with facilitating these works.\r\nThe method statement will need to be agreed with:\r\n\r\nTerritory Outside Party Engineer\r\nNetwork Rail (London North Eastern)\r\nGeorge Stephenson House\r\nToft Green\r\nYork YO1 6JT\r\n\r\nTel: 01904 389810\r\nFax: 01904 389802\r\nEmail: opelondonnortheastern@networkrail.co.uk"
