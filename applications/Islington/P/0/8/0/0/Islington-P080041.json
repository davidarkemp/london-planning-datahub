    "REASON: The addition of a new mansard storey, on a property in a terrace group of otherwise identical three-storey houses without roof extensions, would fail to respect the scale & character of the building itself, & of the other houses in the terrace group. The adjacent locally-listed pub building is totally different in architectural style & character, & provides no justification for an additional storey on 24 Hercules Street, with the need not to reduce the pre-eminence in the streetscape of this fine corner building constitutes a strong argument against such a new storey. The proposal would conflict with the principles set out with respect to roof extensions in Section 2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guidelines 2006 & with Policy D4 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
