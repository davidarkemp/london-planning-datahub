  "description": "Lombards is a new concept jewellery shop which will sell new and second hand jewellery and will also provide a pawn brokers service and cheques cashed service. The current retail business trading from the unit is a men’s clothing store. The proposal is to change the current shop, from a men’s clothing store into Lombards jewellery shop. In order to accommodate the new jewellery shop, a new shop front will be required. The new shop front will include laminated-security glass, new upgraded window frames and a new integrated door. A new signage fascia board to replace the current one is also proposed. The new sign will fit within the old perimeters and will be constructed in similar or improved materials . two new projecting signs are also proposed. The signs will not be internally lit. The front door, adjacent to the shop, which accesses the first floor above the shop front, will be replaced with an upgraded timber door which will integrate well with the new shop front .The proportions of the glazed areas will be improved. All the new frame work and doors will be a wooden construction painted in dark blue.",
