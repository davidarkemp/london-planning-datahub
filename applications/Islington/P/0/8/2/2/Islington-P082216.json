    "Reason: The proposed outbuilding by reason of its design, scale, massing and excessive footprint in this rear garden location would fail to respect the surrounding locality and would result in a loss of rear amenity and open space which currently exists on site and among adjacent rear garden areas. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Islington's Unitary Development  Plan policies D1 (Design), D3 (Design and Layout), D4 (Design in context), R9 (Changes of use)."
