    "REASON: The proposed third floor roof extension, by reason of its siting in a prominent position, size and in-filling of the rear butterfly roof, will be visible from the public realm and is considered to harm the overall visual amenity and character of the terrace and surrounding St John's Grove Conservation Area, contrary to Polices D1 (Overall Design), D3(Siting), D4 (Designing in Context), D11(Alterations and Extensions), D22 (new Development in Conservation Areas) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, St John's Grove Conservation Area Guidelines 2002 and the guidance set out in the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
