    "REASON FOR REFUSAL: The proposed replacement UPVC windows, due to their use of unsympathetic material and their appearance, would be inappropriate and out of character with the host building and the surrounding properties to the detriment of the character and appearance of the existing building and wider area.  For this reason, the proposal is contrary to Policies D1, D4, D11  of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 as well as section 2.3.1 of the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
