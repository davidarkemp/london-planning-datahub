    "REASON: The proposed mansard would be visible in long views from Lofting Road. This would fail to preserve the appearance of the terrace and of the Barnsbury Conservation Area and conflict with the Design Guidelines for that conservation area. The proposal would fail to satisfy the objectives of Policy D19 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, which confirms that the council will seek to preserve the special character and appearance of the area, and would conflict with the provisions of Policy D25 of that Plan, which rules out roof extensions visible from any street-level position where this would be detrimental to the  character or appearance of the area."
