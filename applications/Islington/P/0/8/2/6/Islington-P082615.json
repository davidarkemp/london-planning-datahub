    "Section A.1 of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, as amended by Part 1 of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No.2) (England) Order 2008, identifies circumstances in which enlargement of a dwellinghouse (other than additions to its roof) would fail to qualify as development permitted by the Order. The proposed single storey infill extension would extend more than 3 metres beyond the main rear wall of the original dwellinghouse. It would therefore not constitute permitted development by virtue of the terms of subsection A.1(e)(i) of the amended 1995 Order."
