    "REASON: The proposal by reason of its design, scale and massing  would detract from the amenities of the adjoining residential unit within 183  Barnsbury Road. The proposed extension would have a detrimental impact on the outlook from the lower ground floor unit and would result in an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Islington's Unitary Development  Plan policiy D3 (Design and Layout)."
