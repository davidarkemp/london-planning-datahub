    "INFORMATIVE: The conversion of the 1st and 2nd floors into self-contained flats would appear to have commenced after planning permission P021122 of 29 July 2002 had expired. Permission P071859 (which allowed the construction of a rear roof extension) showed the combined 1st, 2nd and attic storeys as one large maisonette unit. Notwithstanding the annotations to the contrary including on approved drawing 01, this permission only allows the retention of the extensions as built and does not grant permission for the three floors to be laid out as self-contained units. The applicants are therefore reminded that the use of the floors in the way indicated on approved drawing 01 is unauthorised, and that a further planning permission would be needed to authorise the retention of this pattern of uses."
