    "REASON:The mansard roof by reason of its inappropriate design, scale and massing would represent an unsightly interruption to the  unaltered and uniform  roof forms along the western section of the  terrace (86-100 Balls Pond Road) and would have an adverse impact on the Ball's Pond Road street scene, the original buildings and the terrace to which it forms part. The proposal is contrary to policies D1, D4  and D11  of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
