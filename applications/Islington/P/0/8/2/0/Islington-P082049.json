    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding the details to the contrary shown on the approved elevations and plans, the lightwell shall be configured to leave at least a 500mm strip of garden between the surround to the lightwell and the inside face of the garden wall, and details of precise measures to avoid the risk of falling into the lightwell shall be separately agreed.\r\n\r\nREASON: The lightwell as configured on the approved drawings would cut off the southern end of the front garden area creating a litter-trap. The railing fence shown around the lightwell would also be crude in design and would be out-of-context and visually intrusive within the terrace. The Council wishes to control these aspects of the proposal in pursuiot of the design objectives embodied in Policies D4 and D11 of Islington's UDP 2002, as amplified in Section 2.4.6 of the Islington Design Guide 2006."
