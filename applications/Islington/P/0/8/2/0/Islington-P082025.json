    "REASON: The proposed mansard roof extension with a terrace/ void area is unacceptable in principle as it would not be sympathetic with the character and appearance of the host building. The mansard extension would be prominent and its design would not respect the established character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area. The design of the roof extension would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene and the Clerkenwell Conservation Area. The proposed roof extension would be contrary to policies D1 Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development in Conservation Areas) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Conservation Area Design Guidelines SPG (2002) and the Urban Design Guide Supplementary Planning Guidance (2006)."
