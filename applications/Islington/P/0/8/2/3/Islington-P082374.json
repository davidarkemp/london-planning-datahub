    "REASON: The proposed removal of the existing portico of the property is not considered acceptable as this feature forms an integral feature of the front facade of the building. The removal of the portico would undermine the architectural integrity of the dwelling and would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the dwelling and the wider setting of the conservation area. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to  policies D1, D3, D4, D11 and D24 of Islingtons Unitary Development Plan 2002."
