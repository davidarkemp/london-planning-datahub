    "REASON: The proposed 2 fascia signs and 1 projecting sign by reason of their inappropriate methods of  illumination are considered to have a detrimental impact on visual amenity of the area and would fail to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding Angel Conservation Area.  The proposal is contrary to policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alteration and Extensions), D13 (Shop fronts) and ENV11 (Advertisements and Signs) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the guidance set out in the Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and the Shopfront Design Guide."
