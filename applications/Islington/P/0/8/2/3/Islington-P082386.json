    "REASON:  The application includes no proposals for screening the flue exhausts on this roof, even though the proposed units would be visible at street level from Featherstone Street and City Road.  The resultant appearance would be unsympathetic to the appearance of the building and to the streetscape.  The proposal would conflict with Policy D1 (overall design), D3 (site planning), D4 (Designing in context) and D11(alterations and extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and section 2.6.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
