    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding any indications to the contrary included on approved drawings 6TT/P101A, P102A, P201.1A and P201.2A, dustbin storage shall be provided in the form of a railed platform and no enclosure shall be formed.\r\n\r\nREASON: Policy D29 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 states the Council's normal opposition iin conservation areas to the covering over of any part of a front basement lightwell, or to the construction of dustbin enclosures. The formation of a bin enclosure here would fail to preserve the appearance of the property in the conservation area and would conflict with Policies D19 and D29. However, since there is currently a flight of metal stairs in the lightwell of 6 Tyndale Terrace, the substitution of a railed platform in the same position as the staircase landing, along with the removal of the staircase itself and formation of a railing gate to the new platform, would represent a net enhancement of the appearance of the property in the conservation area and would justify an exception being made to Policy D29."
