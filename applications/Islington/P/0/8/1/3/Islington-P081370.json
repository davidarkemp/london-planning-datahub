    "REASON FOR REFUSAL: The design of the building is substandard as it includes a blank frontage on the front and rear elevation at ground floor level and the proportions and positioning of the fenestration is poorly considered. As such, the proposed development would have a detrimental effect on the streetscene and would be contrary to Policies D4 (designing in context) and D5 (townscape) of the Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Urban Design Guide 2006."
