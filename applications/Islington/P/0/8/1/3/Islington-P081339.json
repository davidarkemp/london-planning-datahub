    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would, by reason of its scale, bulk and resulting overall height, the unsympathetic roof design, lack of set backs and visibility would result in a development that would not appear subordinate to the original building, and would dominate the traditional roof features of the building in particular the front gable features directly adjacent. This would not respect the architectural integrity of the existing building. The proposal would harm the appearance of the building and result in significant harm to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The proposal would be contrary to policies Env1 & 2 (New Development), D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D22 (New Development), D24 (Materials), D25 (Roof Extensions) and Imp14 (Central London) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
