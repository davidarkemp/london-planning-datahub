However, you are advised that provision of accurate drawings (in terms of the size of the roof area) that also includes provision for plant, lift over run and solar water panel provision is unlikely to result in an area of 220sqm available for green roof as required by the condition. Should this be the case, an application under s73 of the Town and Country Planning Act would be required to vary the wording of the condition and consider a provision of below 220sqm."
