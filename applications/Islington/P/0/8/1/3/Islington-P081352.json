    "REASON: The proposed works at basement level are harmful to the special historic and architectural interest of the listed building contrary to Planning Policy Guidance Note 15: Planning and the Historic Environment and advice in English Heritage's 'London Terrace Houses 1660 - 1860'.  In particular, the removal of the staircase lobby partitions and the rear chimney breast would involve the loss of historic fabric and architectural features that make a very significant contribution to the character and historic plan form of the building, the proposed increased opening to the front chimney breast due to its excessive scale would result in unnecessary loss of historic fabric and harm to an important architectural element of the listed building and the removal of the downstand between the front and rear rooms would remove the evidence of the historic plan form."
