  "description": "South extension: Small room with sleeping balcony area above built inside the central area of the existing south courtyard behind the boundary wall to Cloudesley Square. North extension: One additional room built on top of the existing single storey building extending north to the same line, and to the same height as, the neighbouring extension in 31 Cloudesley Square. The extension works include raising the perimeter walls along each side boundary of the rear of the single storey building to increase security and privacy. Additional sustainability features: The drawings show locations for new photovoltaic or solar thermal panels to provide on site renewable energy generation, and sedum roofs to the extensions to improve local biodiversity.",
