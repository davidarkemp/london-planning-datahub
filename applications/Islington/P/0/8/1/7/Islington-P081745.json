    "REASON: Policies Env9 & Env10 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 seek to avoid an unnecessary clutter of structures, signage, equipment cabinets & other street furniture on the public footway & to ensure that the necessary minimum items of street furniture are designed to high standards & properly integrated into the street environment. The installation on the public footway of a freestanding pole-mounted antenna array & the associated equipment cabinets & meter cabinet, & their long-term retention, runs counter to the objectives of these policies."
