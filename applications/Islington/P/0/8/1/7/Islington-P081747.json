    "The proposed roof extension, by virtue of its height and prominent location would disrupt the rhythm of the otherwise unimpaired roofline, harming the character and integrity of this part of the terrace and the setting of the adjacent listed building. The roof extension, by virtue of its height and location would also detract from the original valley roof profile at the rear of the building and be harmful to the townscape. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 2.17 of PPG15 (Planning and the Historic Environment), policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and to paragraphs 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 of the Supplementary Planning Document Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
