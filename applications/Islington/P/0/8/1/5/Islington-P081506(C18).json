    "REASON: The proposed details do not adequately demonstrate how areas will be managed to minimise conflict between vehicles and pedestrians. A management plan has not been submitted, the pedestrian access path is of insufficient width, the demarcation of the routes is insufficiently detailed and the ability to access those other parts of the site due to the introduced level differences has not been resolved. The submitted details therefore fail to accord with policies D3, T19, T46, Env12 and Env15 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
