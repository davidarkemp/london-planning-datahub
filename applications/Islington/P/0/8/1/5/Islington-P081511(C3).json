    "REASON: The design of the proposed shopfront is considered to be unacceptable due its unbalanced appearance and the large area of dead frontage it would create, which would have a significantly detrimental effect on the character and appearance of the host building, the street scene and the surrounding Chapel Market / Penton Street Conservation Area conflicting with the Council's efforts to improve the quality of the physical environment in the Chapel Market area and contrary to Policies Env1, D1, D4 and D13 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, paragraphs 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 of the Urban Design Guide 2006 and Shopfront Design Guide 2003."
