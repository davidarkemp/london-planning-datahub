    "REASON: The submitted details of the fire escape door demonstrate an unacceptable standard of design and poor quality materials. The resulting appearance of the development is not acceptable and fails to ensure that the resulting appearance of the development is of high quality. The application does not include details of an alarm system no provides threshold details and therefore fails to demonstrate that the development would accord with policies D1, D3, D4, D11 and Env12 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
