    "REASON: The subject property is not accurately illustrated on the submitted drawings as the rear extensions and front alterations to the property illustrated on the existing and proposed drawings (MR.01 and MR.05B) have not been built in accordance with the submitted plans, nor do they have prior planning permission. Full planning permission is required for the illustrated rear extensions and front alterations and it is therefore considered that the proposal for conversion into three flats is premature. The viability of the  proposed conversion development relies on the rear extensions and alterations in order to comply with the relevant Policies of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, along with the Islington Supplementary Planning Standards Guidelines (2002) and this application is premature as it cannot be assessed independently from the unauthorised rear extensions and alterations."
