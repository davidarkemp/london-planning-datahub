    "REASON: The removal of the front garden area to provide a hard standing, combined with the removal of the front boundary wall would harm the character and appearance of both the street scene and the East Canonbury Conservation Area.  The proposal fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area and by reason of the loss of garden space, would be harmful to visual amenity and attractiveness of the street. The proposal is contrary to Policies H6 (Garden Land), D4 (Designing in Context), D19 (Conservation Areas), D22 (New Development), D31 (Boundaries) and T24 (Front Garden Areas) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, along with the East Canonbury Conservation Area Guidelines 2002 and Urban design Guidelines."
