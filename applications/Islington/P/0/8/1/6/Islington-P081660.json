    "REASON: The proposed extensions (ground, first and roof levels), by reason of their scale, bulk and design and because of the sites prominent position, would constitute an obtrusive form of development within the Whitehall Park Conservation Area. The extensions would form a dominant element when viewed from the public realm to the side and rear, and they would not relate to the existing character and scale of the subject host building. They would cause harm to the character and appearance of the Whitehall Park Conservation Area. The proposed extensions are contrary to Policies Env1 (New Development), D1(Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4(Designing in Context), D11(Alterations and Extensions), D24 (materials), D25 (Roof Extensions) and D28 (Rear Extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002), along with the Whitehall park Conservation Area Guidelines (2002) and Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
