    "The majority of our views relate to the junction of Goods Way and York Way.  Our engineers are concerned about the southern arm of the junction, specifically:\r\n- The swept path analysis shows that in order for an articulated vehicle to turn left into Goods Way, it will need to move into the second northbound lane (refer figure copied below).  This raises traffic safety issues for vehicles in the eastern northbound lane on York Way.  This should be looked at in more depth to ensure that safety issues are addressed.\r\n- Further detail is required on the use of the site on the south-west corner of the junction.  There is a crossover proposed to be retained on York Way - we are conscious of its location in relation to the cycle lane and ASL and have concerns regarding cycle safety.\r\n \r\nClarification is also sought on the pedestrian phasing of the lights at this junction."
