    "REASON: The proposed excavation for the basement would put a great deal of pressure on the adjoining tree at No. 37 Great Percy Street, which has the potential to cause major damage to the tree.  The proposed development would create an inappropriately poor relationship between the building and the tree, which would lead to unnecessary pressure to prune or remove the tree.  The information submitted with the application has not addressed the impact on this tree or its location. The proposal does not therefore comply with policies Env6 (Protecting Trees), Env21 (Nature Conservation Principles), of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and policies 3D.8 (Realising the value of open space and green infrastructure) and 3D.14 (Biodiversity and nature conservation) of the London Plan (2008) and PPS9 'Biodiversity and Geological Conservation'."
