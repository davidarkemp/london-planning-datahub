    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding the approved plans, and in particular the annotation on the layout of the lower ground floor included on drawing 448 TP/10,  this decision does not confer any consent for the removal of the original main staircase between the lower ground floor and upper ground floor level. Drawings showing details of how the staircase is to be sealed off in situ shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority, prior to any works commencing on site, and shall thereafter be carried out in accordance with the approved details prior to the first occupation of any of the flats hereby approved.\r\n\r\nREASON: In order to preserve original fabric and to avoid compromise to the original plan-form and architectural interest of the listed building, in line with the guidance contained in PPG15."
