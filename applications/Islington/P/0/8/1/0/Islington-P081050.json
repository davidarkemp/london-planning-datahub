    "The proposed first floor rear extension represents over develoment of the site, which does not respect the scale, form and character of the existing host building and its surroundings. For this reason the proposal would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding Barnsbury Conservation Area and is contrary to polices D1, D4, D8, D11, D22 and D28 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 as well as the relevant guidance set out in the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006 and Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, which have been adopted as Supplementary Planning Guidance."
