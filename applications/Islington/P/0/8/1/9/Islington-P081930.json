    "REASON: The proposed design and location of the extraction system and associated duct work of the proposed take-away premises (A5 Use) would dominate the rear elevation of the subject property and be highly visible from the public realm, given the corner location of the property at the junction of Holloway Road and Hargrave Road. It would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and would be detrimental to the amenity of surrounding residential properties, particularly the residential units on the upper floors of the subject property. The proposal is contrary to Env1 (New development), Env17 (Protecting Amenity), D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and S31 (A3, A4 and A5 Uses) of the Unitary Development Plan 2002, along with the Urban Design Guidelines 2006."
