The proposal would be visible from the public realm, causing visual harm, and it would dominate the appearance of the original building to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The scheme would be contrary to policies  Env1 & 2 (New Development), D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing on Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Unitary Development Plan (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
