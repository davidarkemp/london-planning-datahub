  "description": "Conservation area consent in connection with the building is currently split into 2 flats, a ground floor flat and a 2 story flat on the 1st and 2nd floors. I am the sole freeholder for the building, but this application only concerns the top flat ie the top 2 floors. I wish to change 3 of the windows on the back of the top as the wooden frames are rotten and damaged. There are currently 4 windows on the back of the property; one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom, one in the spare bedroom and one on the half landing going up to the second floor. The kitchen window is already a PVC double glassed unit. The other windows are all wooden windows. I would like to change these wooden windows for PVC double glazed units in order to increase security and increase heating efficiency. As stated all these windows are on the back of the property and none are visible from any road or public walk way. Also as stated one of the windows at the back of the flat is already PVC, there are also already a number of properties in the street with PVC windows on both sides of the property. None of the windows would be changing in size from the existing size or dimensions. Also full planning ref P081902 submitted",
