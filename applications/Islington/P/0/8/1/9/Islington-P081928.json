    "At the time of submission of the application, namely the 18th September 2008, the proposed side extension would have constituted permitted development by virtue of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A. However, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991 section 192(4) states that:\r\n\r\nThe lawfulness of any use or operations for which a certificate is in force under this section shall be conclusively presumed unless there is a material change, before the use is instituted or the operations are begun, in any of the matters relevant to determining such lawfulness.\r\n\r\nThe coming into force of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No.2) (England) Order 2008 on 1st October 2008 is a material consideration therefore as the work has not yet started the proposed side extension does not benefit from permitted development rights by virtue of the Schedule Part 1 Class A.2 (b) and an application for planning permission is required."
