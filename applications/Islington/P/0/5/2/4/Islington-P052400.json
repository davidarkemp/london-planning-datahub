    "INFORMATIVE: The proposal is for a mixed use development including residential and retail, within a scheme of up to 16 storeys. Within the visual analysis and townscape consideration should be given to longer views in photomontages especially from St Pauls Road/Balls Pond Road. This Council therefore consideres  that the scope of the visual analysis/townscape analysis be extended in particular to views from the west along St Paul's Road/Balls Pond Road."
