    "REASON:  Policy D2 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 requires planning applications for developments to be accompanied by clear and accurate drawings. The submitted drawings fail to adequately satisfy this requirement, particularly in relation to the proposed front elevational treatment and rooflights, but also with respect to the precise relationship between the commercial and residential parts of the extended building, the locations in which the lower residential units would have external walls in which it would be physically possible to form windows and the precise configuration of and access onto the new staircase intended to serve the residential units . The proposal would conflict with the requirements of Policy D2."
