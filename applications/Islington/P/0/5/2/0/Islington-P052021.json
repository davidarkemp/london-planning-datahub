    "REASON:  The proposal by virtue of its overall height and bulk and also its close proximity (at 5th floor level at Clerkenwell Road) to the Hat and Feathers Grade II listed building would unduly cramp the listed building, prevent its parapets from being seen clear to the sky and have a detrimental impact on its setting and the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.   The proposal is contrary to Policies D1, D4, D5, D22, D39, CS5, CS6, CS7 and Imp15 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Council’s approved SPG ‘Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002’."
