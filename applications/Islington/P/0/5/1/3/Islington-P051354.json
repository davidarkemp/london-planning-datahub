    "CONDITION:  Notwithstanding the hereby approved plans the rooflight in the front roof slope has not received planning permission and is unacceptable and it should therefore be removed within three months from the date of this decision notice.  Following the removal of the rooflight the roof shall be made good using slates to match those on the existing front roof slope and no further rooflights shall be inserted.\r\n\r\nREASON:  The insertion of rooflights in visible front roof slopes of buildings within the Whitehall Park Conservation Area is harmful to the character and appearance of the building and the wider Whitehall Park Conservation Area contrary to policies D1, D4, D11, D22 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and to approved Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
