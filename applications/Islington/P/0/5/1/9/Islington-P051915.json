    "Whilst the Council supports the principle of redeveloping this site,  there are strong concerns regarding the building's frontage towards the canal side.  This section of the land has, on the south side, buildings which rise vertically from the water.  A slight recessing of the ground floor to allow pedestrian access would be acceptable but the current proposal results in a loose footage which does not relate to the canal side and does not reinforce the canal side character.  London Borough of Islington wish to see a stronger frontage to the canal side and for this reason objects to this proposal."
