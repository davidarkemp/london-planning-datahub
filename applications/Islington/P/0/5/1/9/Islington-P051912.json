The proposals shown on the drawings submitted with this proposal are inconsistent and mutually self-contradictory, and as a result it is not possible for the Local Planning Authority to be certain as to the exact finished form, appearance and internal layout for which planning permission is being sought. The failure to submit clear, unambiguous drawings conflicts with Policy D2 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
