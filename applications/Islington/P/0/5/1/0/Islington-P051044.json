    "REASON:  On the basis of the information provided by the applicant and the observations made by the planning officer when site visiting on the 8th June 2005, the Council as a Local Planning Authority, is satisfied that the use of the second floor of no. 468 Hornsey Road as two 1 bedroom flats has persisted since well over four years since 1995.  By passage of time the development is now immune from enforcement action and thereby lawful by virtue of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990: Section 191."
