    "REASON:  The eastside of Junction Road has a consistent front building line set back from the public highway and uniform building heights.  The proposed development sits forward of the established front building line and fails to respect the contextual building height.  The surrounding context of the development site consists of residential properties which have a rhythm, urban grain and vertical emphasis appropriate for residential development.  The proposed development fails to respect this architectural language. The inappropriate siting with regard to the front building line coupled with the bulk of the proposed development will also adversely affect the residential amenities of  neighbouring residential properties in terms of daylight and outlook.  The proposed development is therefore contrary to policies 2A.1 & 4B.6 of the adopted London Plan (2004); ST1, ST3, ST4, ST13, H12, D1, D4 & D5 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
