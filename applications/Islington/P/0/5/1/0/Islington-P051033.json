    "REASON:  Policy D25 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 states that roof extensions visible from street level will not be permitted in conservation areas where this would harm the character or appearance of the area. The new 3rd floor roof storey at 20 Ashby Street would be highly visible due to its end-of terrace, corner situation, and would  fail to respect the architectural character of the building. The proposal conflicts with Policy D25, with the strategic policy of preserving and enhancing areas of special architectural interest as key elements of Islington's character and with the provisions of PPG15."
