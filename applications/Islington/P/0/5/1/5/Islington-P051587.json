    "REASON:  The cubic volume of the proposed extension is calculated 66.5m3. which exceeds 10% of the volume of the original terraced dwelling house, the total volume of which is calculated at 620m3.  In addition, the proposed ground floor kitchen breakfast room extension is shown on the submitted drawings as being built on the party boundary with No. 25 Fairbridge Road, thereby not wholly within one dwelling house.  The proposed extensions are not within the description of permitted development as prescribed by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 Schedule 2, Part 1 and are thereby not Lawful."
