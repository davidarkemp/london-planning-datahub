    "CONDITION:  The temporary extension hereby approved shall be removed from the site and the site and adjacent listed building restored to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority no later than two years from the date of this permission, unless the temporary extension is incorporated within an alternative approved scheme for the redevelopment of the site, implementation of which must have commenced to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority within the stated two year period.\r\n\r\nREASON:  The design, appearance and materials of the extension are unacceptable for a permanent development, being detrimental to the character and appearance of the listed building and the wider Hat and Feathers Conservation Area.  The extension is only acceptable for a limited period pending redevelopment of the wider site, in order to facilitate the repair and re-opening of the public house."
