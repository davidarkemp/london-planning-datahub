    "CONDITION:  The noise level LAeq Tr arising from the operation of the proposed studio, measured or predicted at 1m from the facade of the nearest noise sensitive premises, shall at all times that the studio use is operating be at a rating level of 5dB(A) below the background noise level LAF90 Tbg.\r\n\r\nThe reference time interval TR shall be one hour during the day (07.00 to 23.00 hours) and 5 minutes during the night (23.00 to 07.00 hours).  The measurement and/or prediction of the noise should be carried out in line with BS 4142: 1997, and as such may make use of measurements over a shorter period if appropriate.  For the background noise measurement, the reference time interval Tbg shall not be less than 15 minutes and the measurements made in accordance with BS 4142:1997 at a time representative of the hours of operation of the plant.  The \"Fast\" time weighting should be used.  The measurements should be reported as facade noise levels.  If it is not possible to measure at 1m. from a facade, the measurement can be made at an equivalent free-field position with a +3dB correction added to calculate the equivalent facade level.  In the event that an assessment of the specific noise level at the nearest residential location is no practicable, the applicant, in agreement wit the Local Planning Authority, can define one or more reference measurement positions which should be relatively close to the item of plant.  The noise level from the facade of the nearest noise sensitive premises can then be calculated on the basis of the measurement(s) at the reference location(s).\r\n\r\nREASON:  In order to ensure that amenity in the area is not prejudiced by noise generated by the activities of the studio, in accordance with the objectives of Policy Env17 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
