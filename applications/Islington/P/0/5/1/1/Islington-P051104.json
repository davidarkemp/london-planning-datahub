    "REASON:  The proposed advertisement shrouds would be harmful to the character and appearance of the listed building and the wider Hat and Feathers Conservation Area by reason of their scale and masking of the attractive public house.  They would also be a visually intrusive element in the streetscene.  The proposal therefore conflicts with Policies Env11, D22, D34 and D39 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), to approved Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and to advice contained in PPG19 \"Outdoor Advertisement Control\".  Inadequate justification has been provided to enable an exception to be made in this case."
