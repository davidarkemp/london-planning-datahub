    "REASON: The proposal would result in an undesirable intensification of use of existing access roads through Rosemary Gardens. This would be likely to give rise to conditions prejudicial to the safety of people using the park together with an increased perception of danger, especially for children, and a perceived loss of amenity and useable space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies Env 17, R11, R12, T55, T45 and T48 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
