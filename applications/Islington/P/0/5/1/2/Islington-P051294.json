    "REASON:  The proposed satellite dishes would be highly visible from the road and public areas and would harm the character of the Listed Building and the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.  The external cabling would also unacceptably harm the character and appearance of the Listed Building.  As such the proposal is contrary to Policies C1, D4, D39 (Highbury Terrace only), the Highbury Fields Conservation Area Design Guide, PPG15 and the English Heritage Guidance 'London Terrace Houses 1660-1860'."
