    "INFORMATIVE:  This application has been refused, because insufficient information has been provided to allow it to be properly considered by the Local Planning Authority.  UPVC framed windows often have a different appearance to timber ones in terms of larger frame thickness and profiles.  You are advised that the replacement of the ground floor windows in isolation from the rest of the property, and the terrace row as a whole, is unlikely to be supported by the Local Planning Authority as it would be harmful to the appearance of the property and the terrace row and contrary to policies D1, D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002.  It is recommended that the existing timber windows be repaired or replaced in a like for like basis in which case permission will not be required."
