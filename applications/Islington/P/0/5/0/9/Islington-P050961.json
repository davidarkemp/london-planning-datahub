Unitary Development Plan Policy D25 and approved Conservation Area Design Guidelines (particularly paragraph 8.16) for the Canonbury Conservation Area consider alterations to roofs including rear slopes.  It is considered that the introduction of roof lights to the rear roof slope would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property, the terrace, and the wider Conservation Area, contrary to Unitary Development policy D25 and to approved Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
