    "REASON:  The proposed full width first floor rear extension, by virtue of its size, design and siting, would result in an overly large and dominant extension that fails to remain subordinate to the existing dwelling and would result in the loss of light and outlook to the directly adjoining, while also resulting in further overlooking into the rear habitable windows in Keystone Crescent.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D1, D3, D4, D11, D22 and D28 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Council's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
