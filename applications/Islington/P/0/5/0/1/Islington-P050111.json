    "REASON:  The proposal represents an unsympathetic treatment to the front windows of a dwelling that otherwise makes a substantial positive contribution to the special character of the Conservation Area.  The proposed window detailing and material are out of character with and unsympathetic to the original windows and the front elevation of the dwelling.  The proposal therefore fails to preserve or enhance the special character of the Conservation Area.  As such the proposal is contrary to Policies D11, D22, D24 and D42 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, and to  approved Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
