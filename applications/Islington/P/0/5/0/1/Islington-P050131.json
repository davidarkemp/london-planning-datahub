    "REASON:  The proposed roof extension, by virtue of its size, design and position, would detract from the character and appearance of the St. Mary Magdalene Conservation Area, while the internal and external alterations would unacceptably harm the setting, fabric and appearance of this Grade II Listed Building.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D1, D4, D11, D22, D25 and D39 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and PPG16 C58."
