    "REASON:  The application site is located within the Camden Passage Specialist Shopping Area, a designated shopping area wherein the number of non-retail units will be limited in order to enhance the character and vitality of the area.  The proposal would result in the loss of A1 floor space within the Camden Passage Specialist Shopping  Area and would - because of the width of frontages compared to the prevailing narrow plot widths and the recent grant of permission for C3 use at the adjacent Phelps Cottage - result in an inappropriately long non-retail frontage, particularly in Islington High Street.  These factors would detract from the pattern and character of the antique and curio shopping in the Camden Passage Specialist Shopping Area in particular and would be detrimental to the character of the wider Angel Conservation Area.  The proposal would be contrary to Policies S13 and D20 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, to approved Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and to the Adopted Angel Town Centre Strategy 2004."
