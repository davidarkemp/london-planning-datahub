    "REASON:  The proposal would by reason of the modern utilitarian design, appearance, materials and location  represent a substantial and negative impact upon the special architectural and historic character of the Grade II Listed Building and important local landmark.  Furthermore the proposal would lead to the loss of historic fabric that would also degrade the special architectural and historic quality of the Grade II listed building and local landmark.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies  D18 and D39 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
