    "REASON:  The application site is located within the Clerkenwell/Smithfield Special Policy Area where most buildings are between three and five storeys high.  Further, the buildings along this stretch of Clerkenwell Road have a uniform height which forms part of the character of the Hat and Feathers Conservation Area.  The proposed addition of a further storey to the front section of the building would add additional bulk and mass to the original building, disrupting the continuous building line of Clerkenwell Road and resulting in a building that would be out of scale with its neighbours and with the prevailing building heights of the area.  The proposed development would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original building and to the wider Hat and Feathers Conservation Area and to the Clerkenwell/Smithfield Special Policy Area.   The proposal would be contrary to Policies D4, D11, D25, CS5, CS6 and CS7 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and to approved Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)\r\n."
