    "CONDITION:  The design and installation of new items of fixed plant shall be such that, when operating, the cumulative noise level LAeq Tr arising from the proposed plant, measured or predicted at one metre from the facade of the nearest noise sensitive premises, shall be a rating level of 5dB(A) below the background noise level LAF90 Tbg.\r\n\r\nREASON:  To ensure the amenity in the locality is not prejudiced.\r\n\r\nNOTES:  The reference time interval Tr shall be 1 hour during the day (07.00 to 23.00 hours) and 5 minutes during the night (23.00 to 07.00 hours). The measurement and/or prediction of the noise should be carried out in line with BS 4142: 1997 and as such, may make use of measurements over a shorter period if appropriate. \r\n\r\nFor the background noise measurement, the reference time interval Tbg shall not be less than 15 minutes and the measurements made in accordance with BS 4142: 1997 at a time representative of the hours of operation of the plant.  The \"Fast\" time weighting should be used. The measurements should be reported as façade noise levels. If it is not possible to measure at 1m from a façade, the measurement can be made at an equivalent free-field position with a +3dB correction added to calculate the equivalent façade level. \r\n\r\nIn the event that an assessment of the specific noise level at the nearest residential location is not practicable, the applicant, in agreement with the local planning authority, can define one or more reference measurement positions which should be relatively close to the item of plant. The noise level from the facade of the nearest noise sensitive premises can then be calculated on the basis of the measurement(s) at the reference location(s)."
