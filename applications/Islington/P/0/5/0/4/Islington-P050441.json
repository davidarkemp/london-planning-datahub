    "REASON:  The proposed residential units fronting onto Lamb's Passage and facing the east flank wall of Sundial Court would, by reason of limited daylight / sunlight to and lack of outlook/ aspect from habitable rooms and lack of noise mitigation measures result in an unacceptable standard of amenity for future occupants of the proposed residential units.  The proposed ground floor unit to the south adjacent to the proposed public space numbered as unit A.01 on drawing number 04136/AP(2)0 10 rev.A, would in addition to these issues, have no defensible space between its habitable room windows and the public spaces and would be located immediately adjacent to the refuse storage and cycle storage facilities. This unit would suffer from an inadequate level of privacy and noise / disturbance.  The proposed development would result in residential units with an unacceptable standard of residential amenity, which would be contrary to policies D1, D3, H7, H10 and H12 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and to approved Planning Standards Guidelines 2002."
