    "REASON:  The unusual curved parapets on the existing buildings make a distinctive contribution to the appearance of this part of the Hat and Feathers Conservation Area and demarcate a clear upper limit to the buildings.  The imposition of the proposed 4th floor on the buildings would mean that the parapets would no longer be seen against the sky and that their impact on the streetscape would be seriously diminished.  The proposal would fail to preserve the appearance of this part of the Conservation Area and would conflict with Policies D19, D25 and CS6 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, and with paragraph 1.22 of the Design Guidelines for the Clerkenwell Green, Charterhouse and Hat and Feathers Conservation Areas."
