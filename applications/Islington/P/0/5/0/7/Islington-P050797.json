    "REASON:  The scale of the proposed development of Block B is unacceptable in regard, in particular, to the quantity and quality of the residential accommodation proposed and results in the provision of affordable housing which lacks sufficient provision of amenity space and the social amenity space.  The development was considered to lack such amenity space across the entire development.  This is contrary to Strategic policy 4.2 which states ' In determining planning applications, to ensure that housing provides appropriate and acceptable accommodation in a good environment' and policies H3 and D3 of the London Borough of Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
