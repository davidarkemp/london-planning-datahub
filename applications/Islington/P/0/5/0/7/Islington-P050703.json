    "REASON: The proposed internal alterations, namely the removal of the chimney breasts, the removal of the stair between ground and basement, the internal subdivisions and the placing of kitchens in the front rooms of the building, would, through loss of original fabric and altering the plan form, harm the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building.  It is therefore contrary to policies D38 and D39 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines, Government guidance in PPG15 and guidance in the English Heritage leaflet \"London Terrace Houses 1660-1840\"."
