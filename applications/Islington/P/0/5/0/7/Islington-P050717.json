    "INFORMATIVE:  The Council recommends that consideration be given to reducing the height of the two side walls of structure to be level with boundary wall and garage; replacing the central block with a planted version, which may include a wooden trellis and painting the reduced walls of the structure a dark colour.\r\nThe above works would result in  a development that would likely be less damaging in visual terms and may receive officer support.  Any subsequent planning application  will be advertised in the usual way and any representations taken into account in the determination process.  This advice is given without prejudice to any decision that the Council may take in the future."
