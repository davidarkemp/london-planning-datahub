    "REASON:  The proposals for the alteration of the listed building are of themselves damaging to the fabric and character of the listed building.  These alterations could only be acceptable in the context of significant community benefits which might derive from a comprehensive planning proposal for the buildings to the rear of the listed building and for the whole of the complex of Post Office buildings.  The development is therefore considered to be premature in the absence of an acceptable planning proposal and would be contrary to Policy D39 of the London Borough of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
