    "REASON:  38 Exmouth Market is within a Protected Local Shopping  Centre (S38) designated under the terms of Policy S18 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002.  Policy S18 states that within such designated frontages planning permission will not normally be granted for changes of use from retail to non-retail uses.  In judging the acceptability of non-retail uses in such centres the Council has regard to a number of circumstances laid out in policy S18, including whether the shopping centre contains an adequate range of key local shops as identified in the supporting text to the policy.  The policy sets a normal limit of no more than  one third of the total number of shop units in the designated centre being in non-retail use.  A committee decision of January 1998 allowed the proportion of  non-retail units to reach 40% provided that only currently vacant retail uses were lost.\r\nMore than 40% of the units within Exmouth Market are already in non-retail use, and the shopping centre does not contain sufficient key local shops.  Loss of a further retail unit would conflict with policy S18 and there are no special circumstances to justify an exception being made in this case."
