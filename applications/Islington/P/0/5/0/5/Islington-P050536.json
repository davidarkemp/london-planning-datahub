The developer is advised that the door must be painted timber (not PVCu as submitted).  Windows should also be painted timber sliding sashes (as submitted) but should be 2 over 2, not 6 over 6 panes.  Further, the design of the door should be simpler.  A straight forward timber panel door is recommended.  The window details submitted are inappropriate in terms of detail.  The windows should have appropriate beading, moulding and horns.  The developer is advised to seek advice from the Conservation Officer prior to the re-submission of details."
