  "description": "Two and a half years ago I replaced my flat's wooden-framed windows because they were rotting and unsafe (and affected the cost of my heating bills and insurance bills). I replaced them with like-for-like windows (three Georgian-style at the front, four plain at the back) which were only slightly in the different in the fact they lock differently (they all have a number of locks on to improve safety/ as opposed to no locks on the originals), are double-glazed toughened glass and are made of UPVC as opposed to wood.\r\nThe windows were installed by Greater London Windows (http://www.glwwindows.co.uk) and backed by FENSA (who govern new windows for their health and safety and structural safety).",
