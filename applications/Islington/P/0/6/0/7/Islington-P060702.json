    "REASON: The proposed loft conversion would involve the creation of a separate studio flatlet. The creation of a new dwelling unit constitutes development for which planning permission is necessary. The extensions would therefore not constitute permitted development within the terms of Classes A & B of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, since permitted development rights for enlargement of dwellinghouses under part 1 only apply where the extended property continues thereafter in use as a single undivided house."
