    "REASON: The adaptation of the cellar for use as habitable residential accommodation, together with the creation of a large two-storey rear projection at cellar & lower ground floor (garden) level & the creation of an attic room, would result in a far greater amount of residential accommodation than the property & site were intended to contain. The resulting accommodation would have a poor standard of residential amenity & a residential density far in excess of the figure identified as an appropriate maximum in Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002. The proposal would conflict with Policy H12 of the Plan."
