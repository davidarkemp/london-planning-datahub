    "CONDITION: The scheme for the sound insulation of the external plant shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the installation of any equipment.  The scheme shall be designed to reduce emissions of noise arising from its use and affecting residential dwellings within Elizabeth Kenny House and Alwyne Square.  The scheme approved by the Local Planning Authority shall be fully implemented in accordance with the approved details before the use, the subject of this consent, commences.  The works and scheme shall thereafter be maintained in accordance with the approved details.  Upon completion of works forming part of the scheme, no alterations to the structure, roof, windows or external facade of the building housing the external plant shall be undertaken without the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority.  All alterations shall be undertaken in accordance with the written approval and thereafter maintained in accordance with the approved details.\r\n\r\nThe scheme shall identify the level of sound insulation and noise control from internal and external locations and provide for their measure and reporting post completion of scheme works.  A written report of attenuation achieved shall be submitted post the completion of works.\r\n\r\nThe scheme shall not be deemed effective unless the rating level of noise emitted from the external plant is at least 5dB(A) below the background level (LA90) at all times of operation.  The rating noise level shall be determined at 1m from the nearest residential facade.  The measurements and assessment shall be made according to BS4142: 1999.\r\n\r\nREASON: In order to protect residential amenity and to comply with Policies Env 17 and D3 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
