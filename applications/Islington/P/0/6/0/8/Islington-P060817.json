    "REASON: The proposal fails to solve the design problems inherent in the character of the site, producing accommodation with restricted amenity. The proposed building would not relate satisfactorily in form to the buildings in the immediate area & the provision of garden space only in front of the proposed house, between it & the street, would give the space a poor standard of amenity & privacy. The proposal would conflict with policy H10 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
