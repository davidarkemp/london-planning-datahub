    "REASON: The existing division of the property into two units included a large maisonette in the combined upper ground, 1st & 2nd floors. The maisonette has enjoyed direct access to the sizeable rear garden & has thus been capable of providing good quality accommodation for larger households with children. Proposed layout plan 05-37-02 presents two of the proposed units as 3-bedroom family units. Even despite the proposed addition of a rear dormer, the Council is not satisfied that the limited attic floorspace that would have adequate headroom would enable the attic to be used as a satisfactory bedroom. It also considers that the distance separating the unit from the rear garden would result in it being unrealistic for occupiers of the top unit to make use of the garden, even if the need to protect the privacy of occupiers of the lower ground floor flat were not to preclude use of the side passage by occupiers of any other unit. The lower ground floor flat meanwhile only manages to incorporate a third minimally-sized bedroom at the expense of producing an awkward & contorted layout for the combined living-dining-kitchen. The small bedroom would also be wholly reliant for its light & outlook on a window which would face onto the flank wall of 25 Hillmarton Road over a distance of barely 2 metres. The Authority therefore consider that the proposed scheme would not replace the large family unit that would be lost with an appropriate unit suitable for family occupation & that the scheme would fail to meet the objectives of Policy H9 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
