    "This Council considers the scale, height and form of the proposed building to be harmful to the setting of the adjacent listed buildings and the wider townscape and Moorfields Conservation Area. There is also discrepancy between the form and function of the building with single level flats reading as maisonettes from the seventh storey upwards. Further more the level of basement parking is also considered to be excessive and contrary to policies restricting off street parking facilities in inner London. It is also noted that most of the units are single aspect, with many orientated to the north, although the number of staircases and lifts would allow for a substantial number of dual aspect flats."
