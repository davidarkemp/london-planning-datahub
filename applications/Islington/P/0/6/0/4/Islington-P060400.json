    "The proposal by virtue of its additional bulk and location will contribute to: -\r\n\r\na) The street clutter along Cowcross Street that will result in the erosion of the quality of the streetscape.\r\nb) Undermine sight lines that will result in a less safe environment.\r\nc) Undermine pedestrian accessibility by constraining the amount of space on the footway and increase the need of on street servicing.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is therefore contrary to policies Env9, Env10, Env12, T32, T46, T47, D20, C13, C14, C15, C16 and C17of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, and to approved conservation area design guidelines."
