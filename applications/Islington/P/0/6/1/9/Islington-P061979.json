    "REASON: The character & configuration of the site would result in a cramped & contorted scheme, providing a low standard of accommodation.  Outlook from the dayroom space would be unacceptably restricted. The built form would not relate to that of buildings in the immediate area & the garden space would not be of an adequate size or appropriately arranged. The proposal would conflict with Policy H10 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002"
