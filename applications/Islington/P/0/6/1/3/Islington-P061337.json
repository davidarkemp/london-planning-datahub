    "Your attention is drawn to the three projecting signs located on the front elevation of the building. There is no planning history for these signs and whilst consent would be required it is considered that an application would not be looked on favourably as the signs also detract from the character and appearance of the Grade II Listed building and surrounding conservation area. It is therefore recommended that these be removed immediately."
