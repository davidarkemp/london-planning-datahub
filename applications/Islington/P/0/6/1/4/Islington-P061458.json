    "Informative: The footway at this location does not have enough width to accommodate the kiosk, a person using the kiosk and allow adequate room for footway traffic to pass. It is advised that a different location should be found that has a wider footway that will allow at least 1.2 metres clear passage width (clear passage around a person using the kiosk) and a further 450 mm clear kerb side space. If you would require further information on this matter please ring Jonathan Tan (Senior Transport Planner) on 020 7527 2358 or the case officer Sukhi Dhadwar on 020 7527 2792."
