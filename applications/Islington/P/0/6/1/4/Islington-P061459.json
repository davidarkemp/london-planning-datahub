    "REASON: The proposed dwelling by virtue of its large encompassing footprint and its bulk, scale, form and design fails to respect its locality and would result in a loss of spaciousness and openness between the two terraces of Hillmarton and Cardozo Road. This will have a detrimental affect on the spacious character and appearance of the Hillmarton Conservation Area.   The proposal is therefore contrary to policies H3, H6, H7, H10, H12, D1, D3, D4, D5 and R9 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002) and Conservation Area Design Guidelines Supplementary Planning Guidance (2002)."
