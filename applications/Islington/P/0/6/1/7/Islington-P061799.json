    "REASON:  The fascia sign and projecting box sign, by reason of both being internally illuminated and the fasica sign being larger than the fascia, would be unduly dominant (especially at night) and the display of the sign/advertisements would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the building and amenity of the surrounding conservation area, contrary to policies D22 and Env11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Shopfront Design Guide (2003) and PPG19 (1992)."
