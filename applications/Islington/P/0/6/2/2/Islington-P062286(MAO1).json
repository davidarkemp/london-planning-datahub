  "description": "Minor amendment to planning permission LBI ref P062286 dated 04/12/06. The amendments are summarised below:\r\n- The amendment will see the loss of three windows, one on each of the first, second and third floor elevations of the proposed extension, facing Nags Head Court. It also appears that there will be a further amendment to the elevation, although not stated by the applicant within the cover letter, which will see the loss of the large window on the ground floor of the proposed extension, adjacent to the bin store and loading bay doors. \r\n- The second amendment will see the reduction in depth of the plant enclosure on the fifth floor, with the door being relocated from the western to the southern elevation, and an increase in the depth of the surrounding balustrade.",
