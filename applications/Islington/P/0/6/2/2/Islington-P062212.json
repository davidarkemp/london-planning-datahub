    "REASON: The proposed dwellings, by reason of their height and footprint in this rear garden location would fail to respect the surrounding locality and would result in a loss of spaciousness and openness between Camden Road and Beacon Hill which effect is exacerbated by views from the street. This will have a detrimental impact on the spacious character and appearance of the Hillmarton Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies H10, H12, D1, D4, D5 and R9 of Islington's Unitary development Plan (2002) and Conservation Area Design Guidelines Supplementary Planning Guidance (2002)."
