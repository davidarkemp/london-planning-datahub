    "It is considered that the half width rear extension is excessive in height,  overly dominant and that this erodes the integrity of the rear elevation of the property.  A lower half width rear extension that conforms to the height of the neighbouring extension at 30 Sudeley Street may be acceptable. You are advised that this is an informal officer opinion only.\r\n\r\nThe ground floor is traditionally the principal floor of the property and as such the loss of the rear window is not acceptable and is detrimental to the character of the listed building. The replacement of this window with a door also entails a roof terrace with balustrade. These are not desirable additions to the rear fa√ßade of the listed building and would compromise its visual amenity. Any further application should include the retention of the main ground floor rear window. You are advised that this is an informal officer opinion only."
