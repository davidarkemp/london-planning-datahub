    "REASON: The scheme would create a mostly single-aspect family-sized unit with no garden, no defensible space outside the rear ground floor living room windows & with mutual serious overlooking at very close range between it & the existing building at 2a Yonge Park. The resulting residential accommodation would provide an adequate standard of residential amenity & its creation would therefore conflict with Policies H3 & H7 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
