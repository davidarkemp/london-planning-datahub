    "It is considered that the half width rear extension is excessive in height, overly dominant and that this erodes the integrity of the rear elevation of the property.  A lower half width rear extension that conforms to the height of the neighbouring extension at 30 Sudeley Street may be acceptable. \r\n\r\nThe ground floor is traditionally the principal floor of the property and as such the loss of the rear window is not acceptable and is detrimental to the character of the listed building. The replacement of this window also entails a roof terrace with balustrade. This is not a desirable addition to the rear fa√ßade of the listed building and would compromise its visual amenity. Further, access to the garden is traditionally through the basement and this should be maintained. Any further application should include the retention of the main ground floor rear window.  \r\n\r\nThe application shows a number of internal walls at the basement level being significantly reduced in size. The removal of these walls results in the loss of the historic fabric and consequent loss of plan form of the listed building. These walls should only be reduced to allow a maximum of a double door to be installed and not to any greater width. You are advised that this is an informal officer opinion only."
