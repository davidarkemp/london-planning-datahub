    "INFORMATIVE:  No fee is required for a re-submitted application which is of the same character, use or description of development on the same site, within 12 months of the date of this decision notice.  Shillingford Road is characterised by two storey (not including basement) mews development.  Having regard for the specific site characteristics, it is considered that this is the maximum height that should be permitted along this road.  The proposed additional storey would be out of character with the existing building and would set an undesirable precedent for future developments along this road.\r\nThe applicant is advised that the  removal of the additional roof terrace at second floor level would enable a revised application to be assessed more favourably however it does not guarantee the application would be given planning approval."
