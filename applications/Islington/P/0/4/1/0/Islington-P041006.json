    "REASON:  The proposal involves the loss of a recently upgraded dwelling let to multiple households, which the Council is satisfied provides residential accommodation to an adequate standard.  The Council considers that such accommodation is a vital part of the provision of affordable rented housing, particularly for single people under twenty five and on low incomes, with its continued availability being for many people the only alternative to homelessness.  Conversion of such accommodation into self-contained units would conflict with policy H8 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
