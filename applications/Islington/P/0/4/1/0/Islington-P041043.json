    "REASON:  The proposal if approved would represent an unsympathetic roof extension that would introduce alien design features to the listed building that would harm the character of the building.  Furthermore the roof extension due to its design and set-back would not harmonise with other roof extensions on the street and would therefore represent a discordant feature in the street scene to the detriment of the listed building and conservation area.  The alteration of the sash window to a door would further erode the original character of the building through the alteration of a key original feature in the elevation.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1, D11 &  D39 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
