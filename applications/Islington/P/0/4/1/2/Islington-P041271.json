    "REASON:  Policy D11 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 requires alterations and extensions to buildings to respect the architectural character and detail of the existing building with such alterations and extensions generally being carried out in the same style and with the same or compatible materials.  The introduction of mini-rib insulated cladding panels on part of the first floor rear wall, the second floor rear walkway parapet and the new third floor walkway parapet, in conjunction with the use of profiled metal panels to clad the enclosures housing the staircases linking the second and third floor walkways would result in an unsatisfactory appearance for the rear elevation.  The proposal would conflict with Policy D11 of the Unitary Development Plan 2002."
