    "REASON:  The proposed development would constitute clutter within the street and would appear as an incongruous and unsympathetic element within the immediate vicinity.  It would cause harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene and the wider Arlington Square Conservation Area and would fail to preserve the setting of nearby listed buildings.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to the requirements of policies D22, D39 and T47 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
