    "INFORMATIVE:  The height of the proposed development on the site is constrained by policy relating to protecting strategic views of St Paul's Cathedral from Greenwich and Blackheath.  This ensures that these important views are not impacted upon by the proposal.  Officers are of the opinion that the design is of a high quality and relates well to the surroundings with a strong design rationale that should produce a functionally robust and visually attractive building.  Furthermore the scheme will improve rail services at the site.  The proposal will however, due to height constraints and topography, not have a visually significant impact upon the character of Islington."
