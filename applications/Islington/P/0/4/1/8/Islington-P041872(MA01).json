P041872:  A sustainability report shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority before superstructure work is commenced on site (for the avoidance of doubt the superstructure comprises only that part of the building that is above ground level).This report shall show how the following can be achieved:\r\n- The development hereby approved will achieve at least a 'Very Good' rating under the BREEAM (BRE Environmental Assessment Method) Ecohomes Scheme.  This rating shall be achieved at all stages of the development.  \r\n- Carbon Indexing of the residential units will be an average of 8.6, with 8.0 as a minimum. \r\n- Detailed calculations for determining the Carbon Index and BRE's Ecohomes rating shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nThe development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved, shall be maintained as such thereafter and no change therefrom shall take place without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\n\r\nREASON:  To promote sustainability and energy efficiency in accordance with policies Env 1, Env 2 and Env 32 of the Islington UDP 2002 and policies 4A.1, 4A.2, 4A.3, 4A.4 and 4A.9 of the London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations) 2008."
