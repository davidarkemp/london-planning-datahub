    "REASON: The proposed development was considered unlikely to deliver sustainable regeneration in the priority area of King's Cross due to the mixture of uses, their nature and the proportion, character and intensity of non (permanent) residential use within that mix.  The scheme was therefore considered to inadequately address the Council's objectives in E12 of the Unitary Development Plan 2002 especially insofar as that the link between the proposed education provision and the needs of the local community was insufficiently secure.  The proposal as a whole was therefore considered to offer insufficient benefits as to outweigh the other concerns regarding the intensity of the use and the impact of the proposed scheme on the local environment."
