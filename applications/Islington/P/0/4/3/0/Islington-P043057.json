The condition currently states:\r\n\"This permission shall operate for the benefit of the applicant (The City University) only and shall not enure for the benefit of the land nor of any other person for the time being having an interest therein.  Upon any cessation of the use hereby approved the building shall revert back to its former lawful use, that being Class B1 (Business) as described in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987.\" The proposal seeks a variation of the condition to read as follows: \"The development shall be occupied only by individuals attending a full-time course of further or higher education at a recognised institution in the London Area.\"",
