    "REASON:  The drawings provided contain insufficient detail to reflect the full extent of the external alterations to these buildings that proposed, some which have already been carried out, including the addition of boiler flues, new windows and front doors to the front elevations and artificial slate on some front roof slopes.  Where details have been provided or these parts of the development carried out on-site, including the refenestration of the rear elevation, inappropriate designs and materials have been chosen that harm both the character and architectural unity of the terrace houses.  As such, approving these details would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Highbury Fields Conservation Area, contrary to Adopted Unitary Development Plan Policies D2, D4, D11, D22, D23, D24 to adopted Conservation Area Design Guidelines for Highbury Fields."
