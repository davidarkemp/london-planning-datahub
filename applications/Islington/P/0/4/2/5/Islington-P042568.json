    "REASON:  The proposed advertisement hoardings would completely envelope the upper floors of this listed building.  This concealing of features of architectural and historic interest is harmful to the appearance, character and integrity of the Grade II Listed Building.  The proposed hoarding covering the facade of the Hat and Feathers Public House does not respect the architectural features of, nor relate to the host buildings.  The hoardings on the sites adjacent to the Grade II Listed Building are, by virtue of their scale, form, positioning and quantity, harmful to the setting of the listed building and in this respect are harmful to the visual amenity of the area.  This proposal is contrary to policies D4, D11, D39 & Env11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the advice of PPG19 and PPG15."
