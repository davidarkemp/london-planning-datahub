    "REASON:  The use of the raised ground, first and second floors (currently arranged as six bedsits) is a house in multiple occupation (sui generis).  The use of the self-contained basement flat falls within Class C3 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987.  The combination of the raised ground, first and second floors with the basement flat to enable occupation of the property as a single dwelling house would result in a material change of use of the raised ground, first and second floors to Class C3.  Planning permission would be required for such a change of use.  In these circumstances it would not be appropriate to issue a Certificate of Lawfulness for the proposed use."
