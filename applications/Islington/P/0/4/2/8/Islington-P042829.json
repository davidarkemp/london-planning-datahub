    "REASON:  The creation of a ground floor flat in a commercial frontage on a main road would expose occupiers of it to excessive noise, disturbance and pollution and would seriously limit their privacy.  This, along with the lack of external amenity space and the restricted light and outlook for the proposed bedrooms, would result in the flat failing to provide an adequate standard of residential amenity.  Use of the ground floor for residential purposes would therefore conflict with Policy H3 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
