    "REASON:  The proposed conversion would require further significant departures from the original plan form of the listed building, creating inappropriate subdivision of the plan form and rooms on upper floors.  The proposals would harm the special architectural interest of the listed buildings, contrary to Policy D39 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and to guidance in PPG15 (including that in paragraph 58 of Annex C)."
