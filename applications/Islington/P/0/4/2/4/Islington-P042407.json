    "REASON:  The proposed advertisement hoardings would screen the Grade II Statutory Listed Building which contributes positively to the distinctive character of the Hat and Feathers Conservation Area.  This shrouding of the listed building would be harmful to the appearance and character of the conservation area and is contrary to policy Env11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and to the advice within PPG19."
