    "REASON:  The proposed roof extension, by virtue of its visibility, excessive bulk, scale and detailed design, would be visually over-dominant, would unduly dominate the roofscape and would be out of scale and character with this and the neighbouring dwellings.  The proposal would also have an adverse effect on the visual amenities in relationship with adjoining buildings of the locality, conservation area and have a harmful effect on the character and appearance of the building.  The proposal is thereby contrary to policies D1, D4, D11, D22, D24, D25 and D28 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Conservation Area Design guidelines 2002."
