    "REASON:  The addition of a further full width storey at 1st floor level, over the entire roof area of the existing single storey rear extension and running right to the back of the site, would mean that the scale of the rear two storey rear extension would be excessive in relation to that of the frontage building.  The proposal would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and of this part of the St.Luke's Conservation Area.  The proposal would conflict with Policies D22 and D28 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and with approved Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
