    "REASON:  The proposed new storey on the rear extension would close the gap between the main rear wall of the building and the flank wall of 9-10 Domingo Street, losing the distinction between the separate groups of properties, and would seriously harm the proportions of the building and the terrace.  The proposal would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property and of this part of the St.Luke's Conservation Area.  The proposal would conflict with Policies D22 and D28 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, and with approved Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
