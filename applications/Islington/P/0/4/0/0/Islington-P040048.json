    "REASON:  Policy D39 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 seeks to ensure that the setting of listed buildings is protected or enhanced. The Green has historically been a paved area bounded by buildings. Those buildings, rather than the space which they surround, are the main elements defining the character of this part of Clerkenwell. The proposed scheme would give excessive prominence to one portion of the area of the historic Green. The buildings surrounding the Green, a number of which are listed, would be reduced in significance, becoming more a backdrop to the landscaped area than the principal defining elements of the Green as a whole. The proposal would be harmful to the setting of the individual listed buildings and would conflict with Policy D39."
