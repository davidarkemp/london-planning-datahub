    "REASON:  The submitted details are insufficient to discharge the requirements of condition 2.\r\nCondition 2 specifically requires that \"screening shall be provided to a height of 1.6m. along the southern elevation.  Details of the extent and the form of the screening and any railings shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of works\".\r\n\r\nThe details submitted so far only relate to railings.  Screening is required to protect the amenity of neighbours by ensuring that there is no overlooking.  The railings would not be sufficient in this respect.\r\n\r\nDetails of suitable screening need to be submitted in order to progress the matter.  It is suggested that an appropriate screening solution might be to provide trellis or wire mesh to the required height which could also be used as a frame for planting.  The combination of planting and trellis/mesh should provide an acceptable screen.\r\n\r\nThe railing details shown are fine from a planning point of view.  Your future submission of details should include these details again.  Please specify that the railings will be painted.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above, it is essential that the railings satisfy the requirements of the Building Acts.  It is recommended that you contact the District Surveyor before resubmitting details in order to ascertain this.  Their details are Building Control Division, Development House, 8A Barnsbury Park, London, N1 1QQ Tel. No. 020 7527 5999.  Fax 020 7527 5989."
