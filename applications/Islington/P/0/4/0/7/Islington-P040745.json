    "INFORMATIVE:  The Local Planning Authority is of the opinion that the property is suitable for restoration into modernised flats, however, any rear projections must be more appropriately related to the rear to the host building and make a positive contribution to the immediate vicinity.  Should you wish to resubmit an application for this site, the Local Planning Authority would advise that the existing rear projection should remain as it is and that any further rear extension should be below the eaves of the roof.  Furthermore the Local Planning Authority would wish to see the restoration of the front boundary wall and garden (incorporating bin storage).  You are advised to seek pre-application advice prior to resubmission."
