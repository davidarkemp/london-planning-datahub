    "REASON:  The proposed side extension would erode the special character of the conservation area by increasing the horizontal spread of the principle building conflicting with the vertical emphasis that defines the special character of the building in St George's Avenue.  Furthermore the proposal would reduce the physical separation between the Victorian terrace and the adjacent modern flats eroding an important break between the two different forms of development and the sense of spaciousness characteristic of the conservation area.  The proposal would therefore have a negative impact upon the host building and the special character of the conservation area and is therefore contrary to policies D1, D4, D11, D26 & D27 of the Islington Development Plan (2002) and policy 11.12 of the Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
