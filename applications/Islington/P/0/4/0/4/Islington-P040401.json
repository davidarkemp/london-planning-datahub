    "INFORMATIVE:  Islington Council is not opposed to the conversion of this site into self-contained units.  However, the proposed units need to include an appropriate mix of accommodation and provide an acceptable level of residential amenity for the future occupiers of these units.  Additionally, the design of any external alterations  needs to respect the character and visual amenity of the host building and the surrounding area.  Please contact the Planning Division if you would like to discuss the type of development that would be acceptable in this location prior to any resubmission."
