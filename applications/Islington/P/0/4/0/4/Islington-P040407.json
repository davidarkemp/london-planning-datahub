No evidence has been provided to show that the breach of condition occurred 10 years prior to the \"Breach of Condition Notice\" being served  on 21st November 2003.  Therefore there is no evidence that the doorway benefits from \"immunity\" as defined by Section 171 B(3) of the DoE Circular 10/97."
