    "REASON:  The proposed development is considered unacceptable in the interests of visual amenity.  More particularly the proposed development by virtue of its bulk and visibility from the street would represent an intrusive visual element which would be out of keeping with the appearance of the property and thus contrary to policy D11 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002).  Further the proposal is out of keeping with the existing pattern of development in the terrace, which generally has not been significantly impaired by roof extensions and retains much of its original character at roof level.  In this regard the proposed development would be contrary to policies D1 and D4 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
