    "REASON:  Schedule 3.2 of the Council's Design Guidelines for the Duncan terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area lists those properties within the Conservation Area where traditional roof extensions may be permitted.  38 St.Peter's Street is not included in that Schedule.  The Guidelines confirm that roof extensions, rooflights or associated party wall alterations visible from the street will not be permitted on any properties not listed in the Schedule.  The formation of the new third floor would conflict with the Design Guidelines and would fail to preserve the appearance of the Conservation Area contrary to the guidance set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 15 and to policies D19 and D25 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
