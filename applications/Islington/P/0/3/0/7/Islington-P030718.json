    "REASON:  The proposed equipment would result in a loss of visual amenity.  More particuarly, the additional equipment cabins and associated raised level rooftop distribution unit would result in a proliferation of visible rooftop equipment adversely affecting the skyline as seen from public open space in City Basin.  The development is therefore considered not to be sited in a manner which minimises the impact on the appearance of the building.  In this respect the siting and appearance of the equipment is contrary to Policy C17 of Islington's adopted Unitary Development Plan (2002)."
