It therefore falls within the scope of paragraph A2 of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 which states:\r\n\"In the case of dwelling house on any article 1(5) land, development is not permitted by Class A if it would consist of or include the cladding of any part of the exterior with stone, artificial stone, timber, plastic or tiles\"."
