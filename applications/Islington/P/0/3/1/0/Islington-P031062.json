    "INFORMATIVE:  When considering proposals to change the planning use of listed buildings, PPG15 identifies an obligation that local planning authorities should balance economic viability against the effect of any changes that these would entail in the special architectural or historic character of the building in question. PPG15 adds that the aim should be to identify the optimum viable use that is compatible with the fabric, interior & setting of the historic building, & that this may not necessarily be the most profitable use, if that use would entail more destructive alterations than other viable uses.\r\nIt is stated in PPG15 that the best use will often be the use for which that building was originally designed. Continuation or reinstatement of that use should be the first option when the future of a building is considered. The Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that sufficient effort has been made to identify alternative occupiers, who could continue the use of the entire listed complex for its existing worship use. It is also not satisfied that sufficient effort has been made to identify occupiers who could use the complex for some other use within Class D1, more compatible with minimising disturbance of the existing layout, features & fabric than the proposed residential use would be."
