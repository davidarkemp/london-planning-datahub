    "REASON:  The proposed development is considered unacceptable in the interests of visual amenity.  More particularly the proposed development by virtue of its bulk and visibility from long perspectives on Prebend Street and Basire Street and the loss of rear butterfly-shaped parapet would represent an intrusive visual element which would be out of keeping with the appearance of the property and those adjacent terraced properties currently unimpaired by roof extensions and retaining much of their original character at roof level.  In this respect the proposed development would be contrary to Policies D11 and D25 of Islington's Adopted Unitary Development Plan (2002).  Furthermore, if permitted, the development would harm the character and appearance of the Arlington Square Conservation Area contrary to Policy D22 of the aforementioned Unitary Development Plan and relevant Conservation Area Design Guidelines which the Council considers it desirable to preserve and enhance in compliance with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990."
