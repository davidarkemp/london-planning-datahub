    "REASON:  The proposed development is considered unacceptable in the interests of visual amenity.  More particularly the proposed development by virtue of its bulk and visibility from Coleman Fields and St. Paul Street would represent an intrusive element, which would be out of keeping with the appearance of the property and other surrounding end of terrace properties currently unobscured by such extensions.  In this respect the proposed development would be contrary to policies D1, D11, D22 and D28 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002).  Furthermore, if permitted the development would harm the character and amenity of the Conservation Area, which the Council considers it desirable to preserve and enhance in compliance with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990."
