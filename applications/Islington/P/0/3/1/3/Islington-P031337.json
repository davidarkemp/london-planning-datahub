    "REASON:  Policy H9 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the associated residential conversion standards in the supplementary Planning Standards Guidelines document of June 2000 (as revised in August 2002) requires accommodation provided in conversion schemes to be adequate in terms of function and design.  Size, shape and disposition of rooms, the 'stacking' of rooms and high quality soundproofing are vital considerations.  The Authority is not prepared to accept poor internal arrangements even though this may result in the overall number of units provided within the property being restricted.\r\n\r\nThe current proposal would result in the creation of a single aspect unit in which significant parts of the unit would not be adequately lit or ventilated.  The shape and layout of rooms fails to satisfy the minimum requirements set out in the Planning Standards Guidelines.  The scheme conflicts with the requirements of Policies H7 and H9 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
