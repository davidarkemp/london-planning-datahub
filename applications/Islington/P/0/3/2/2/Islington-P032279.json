    "REASON:  The formation of a widened opening, and the fitting of the roller shutter and projecting shutter box, would fail to respect the architectural character of the original building, would fail to preserve the character of this portion of the East Canonbury Conservation Area, would be harmful to the special architectural interest of the Grade 2 listed building and would adversely affect its setting.  The proposal would therefore conflict with policies D11, D24 and D39 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002."
