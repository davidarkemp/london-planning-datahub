    "OBSERVATION:  Traffic reduction is at the centre of Islington's Sustainable Transport Strategy and the Council is committed to achieving significant reductions in traffic.  The Council also aims to achieve significant improvements in the quality of the urban environment including improved air quality, reduced levels of noise and a reduction in congestion.\r\n\r\nCycling is quick, healthy, and in itself, silent, non-polluting, relatively cheap and unlikely to cause serious congestion.  cycling therefore has the potential to bring many benefits to the community and Islington actively encourages and promotes the wider use of cycling and cycling facilities within London.\r\n\r\nLondon Borough of Islington therefore strongly supports the principles of this scheme and any other that provides new cycling facilities for public use."
