    "REASON: The residential units provided within the property would not provide an adequate standard of residential amenity by virtue of the inclusion of under-sized rooms, of the poor light to and outlook from habitable rooms in the basement, ground and 1st floors, of the high degrees of mutual overlooking between units at the lower three floors, of overlooking between the rear ground floors of Nos 180 & 182 and of the basement layout in which the sole access to bedrooms is off the living area and those rooms are vaults with low headroom. The scheme therefore fails to satisfy the requirements of Policies H3 and H9 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 or to comply with the standards for residential accommodation set out in the Islington Planning Standards Guidelines 2002."
