    "REASON: Residential units within the combined properties would not provide an adequate standard of residential amenity by virtue of unsatisfactory layouts and under-sized rooms, of poor light to and outlook from habitable rooms in the basement, ground and 1st floors, and of mutual overlooking across lightwells between Flat 182C and Flats 180B and 182B. The proposed accommodation fails to meet the standards set out in the Islington Planning Standards Guidelines 2002 and the scheme conflicts with Policies H3, H7 and H9 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
