    "REASON: The submitted drawing EPA 118-ELV Rev E and the Design and Access Statement do not between them provide sufficient detail for the Council to be satisfied that the treatment of the shop unit fascia and entrance door would preserve the appearance of the building in the conservation area, especially so since the indications of the proposed treatment of the entrance door vary. The proposal therefore fails to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Policies D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
