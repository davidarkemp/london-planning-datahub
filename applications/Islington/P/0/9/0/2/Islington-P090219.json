    "REASON: The proposed design of the  front elevation is considered to be an  unsympathetic addition to the surrounding  Calabria Road conservation area by reason of its over elaborate design and choice of finishing materials.  The development would fail to bear any relationship to the design of adjoining houses within the surrounding locality. The development is therefore considered contrary  to polices D1, D4, D11,D24, conservation area guidance note 38  and Islington's Urban design Guidance 2006."
