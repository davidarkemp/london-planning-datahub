    "REASON: The extension breaches the terms of sub-section B.2(c) of Class B of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No.2) (England) Order 2008 which states that:\r\n\r\n“Any window inserted on a wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse shall be\r\n(i) obscure-glazed, and\r\n(ii) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.” \r\n\r\nThe roof extension therefore does not constitute permitted development within the meaning of Class B of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No.2) (England) Order 2008."
