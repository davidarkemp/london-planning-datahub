However, the remainder of the development requires a minimum reveal depth of 120mm or the length of the bricks used prior to this part of the condition being discharged. In addition, the drawings should more clearly identify where within the development each 'window jamb' detail refers to. No approval is given for sub-point (b) of this condition."
