    "REASON: The proposed two storey rear extension by reason of its excessive design, scale and massing would form an overdominat and visually incongrous feature to the rear of the host dwelling. The proposed development would fail to bear any relationship to the surrounding pattern of developnment and fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider Canonbury Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policies D1, D4, D11, D24 of  Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2006 and Conservation Guidance Note 8."
