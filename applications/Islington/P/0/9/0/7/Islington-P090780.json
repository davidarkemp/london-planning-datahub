    "REASON: The proposed erection of two new floors to the front of the building is considered to be an excessive and visually obtrusive feature to the front of the building. The proposed extension would disrupt the existing uniform and rhythmic roof height of the terrace of buildings and would have a detrimental visual impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding St Mary Magdelene Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to polices D1, D4, D11, D24, H3 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006 and Conservation Guidance Note 6."
