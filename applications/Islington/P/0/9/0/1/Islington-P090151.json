    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding that the approved drawings show a two-storey rear extension with a part width upper level behind the stair compartment, the rear extension shall only be built as a single-storey full-width rear basement extension. No part-width upper storey shall be built and the existing long staircase window shall be retained in situ.\r\n\r\nREASON: The existing long staircase window, spanning the half-landing level between the 1st and 2nd floors, is an important element of the character of this terrace of buildings. Its modification would harm the architectural character of the building and of this part of the outstanding Canonbury Conservation Area (CA8). This condition is therefore imposed to avoid conflict with  the guidance set out in PPG15 and with the provisions of Policies D11, D19 and D24 of the UDP."
