    "REASON: The proposed antennae would harm the appearance of a building of some merit and prominence at the junction of Westbourne Road and Bride Street, at a gateway for people approaching the western part of the St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area from the north, and on a route which leads directly to the outstanding Barnsbury Conservation Area. The property is visible in longer views along Westbourne Road and Bride Street and the antennae would rise prominently on the skyline when viewed from these vantage points. This would conflict with the principles embodied in PPG15 (\"Planing & the Historic Environment\") as well as with the Council's own Design Guidelines for the St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area  (which explicitly resist the installation of radio or satellite equipment at roof level where this can be seen from street level or public space, including long views from side streets).  Their installation would also conflict with the similar principles set out in the Islington Urban Design Guidelines 2006 (which seek to ensure that mobile phone masts should be largely obscured from the surrounding public realm and do not impact adversely upon the skyline from longer views) and would run counter to the expectation in Policy D19 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 that developments in conservation areas should preserve the special character and appearance of the conservation area."
