    "REASON: The amended treatment of the approved enlarged side extension would make it appear top-heavy, overturning the usual hierarchy by which the apparent storey height diminishes as you read up the elevation. It would also give undue prominence to the top storey. Such an arrangement would be unsympathetic to the appearance of the building and its relationship to the neighbouring terrace and would conflict with the objectives of Policies D4, D11 and D27 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
