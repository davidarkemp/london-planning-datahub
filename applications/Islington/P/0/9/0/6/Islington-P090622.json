    "REASON: Adding a further storey to the property would result in it rising a full storey above its immediate neighbour to the north and 1Â½ full storeys above the overwhelming majority of houses in the terrace on the east side of Canning Road. This would involve raising the party parapet walls, which would themselves be visible in oblique views from up and down the street. It would also disrupt the uninterrupted run of rear butterfly parapets running from Canning House at the southern end of the terrace virtually to the northern end of the street. The proposal would harm visual amenity by damaging the unity of the terrace as a whole and would hence conflict with the requirements of Policy D4 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and with the design principles outlined in the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
