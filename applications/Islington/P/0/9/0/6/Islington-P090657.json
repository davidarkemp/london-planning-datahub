    "REASON: The proposed studio flat would provide a poor standard of residential amenity by virtue of being located at the back edge of pavement on a very busy road and with no external area for respite and ventilation at the rear, and the flat would have poor light & outlook by virtue of being fitted only with two windows at the front of the property. The units would fail to satisfy the requirements of Policy H3 (New Housing and Changes of Use to Residential) and H7 (Standards and Guidelines) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
