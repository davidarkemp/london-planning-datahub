    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, by virtue of being visible from the front, side and rear of the building would disrupt the rhythm of the uninterrupted roofline and fail to respect the scale, form and character of the area, which would be harmful to the unity of the terrace and the character and appearance of the East Canonbury Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D25 (Roof extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and to guidance contained within Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
