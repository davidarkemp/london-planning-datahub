    "REASON: The development, by reason of the antenna's design and location centrally on the front elevation, would be highly visible in views in front of the building line, and would therefore have a detrimental impact on the form, character and appearance of the host building, the street scene and the Charterhouse Square Conservation Area. The development is contrary to Policies Env 10 (Street Furniture, Paving and Streetscene), D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D22 (New Development) and C17 (Telecommunications equipment) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines (2006)."
