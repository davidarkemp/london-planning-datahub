    "REASON: The proposal would conflict with the objectives of Policy D4 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, which seeks to ensure that alterations to buildings are sympathetic to the character and design of the building. It would also conflict with Policy D24 of the Plan, which seeks to ensure that traditional materials are used for refurbishments in conservation areas, and with Policy D31 of the Plan which supports the preservation, retention and reinstatement of front boundary railings, boundary walls and traditional iron work in conservation areas. As a consequence, it would go against the objectives of Policy D19 of the Plan, which confirms the Council's commitment to use the designation of conservation areas as a mechanism to achieve the preservation and enhancement of the special character and appearance of designated conservation areas, in line with the duty imposed upon it by PPG15:Planning and the Historic Environment."
