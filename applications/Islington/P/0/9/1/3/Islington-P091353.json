    "REASON : The proposed rear extension at second floor level would introduce a discordant element into the terrace which disrupts its established rhythm and is not subservient to the existing property.  The proposal is harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area contrary to the objectives of policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the policies contained within sections 2.4 and 2.5 of the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
