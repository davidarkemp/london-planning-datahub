    "REASON: The proposed extension by virtue of its design, scale and prominent siting in the public realm, would detract from the existing uniform roof heights along Crescent Street and would significantly alter the roof form and finish of the host building to the detriment of the established uniformity and rhythm which exists with in the group of buildings along this section of Crescent Street while eroding the clear and legible open spaces which exist between 12 Crescent Street and 16 Huntingdon Street. The proposed extension would have a detrimental visual impact on views into the site from within the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies to D1 (Design), D4 (Urban Context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D25 (Roof extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islingtonâ€™s Urban Design Guidance 2006, conservation guidance note 10 and PPG 15."
