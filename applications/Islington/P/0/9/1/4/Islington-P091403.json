    "REASON: The proposed cabinet, by reason of its prominent location at the junction of Elizabeth Avenue and Elmore Street, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding built fabric and the East Canonbury Conservation Area. The development is contrary to Policies Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and Streetscene), D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D22 (New Development) and C17 (Telecommunications equipment) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines (2006)."
