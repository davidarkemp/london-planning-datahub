    "REASON: The submitted axonometric visualisations provide a general indication of the geometry and characteristics of the proposed roof extension works, but cannot be measured to establish the exact dimensions of the existing roof or of the roof extension proposed. The proposed increase in volume cannot be accurately calculated on the basis of the submission. It is also not made clear whether the facing materials would match the original facing materials of the building, as required by a condition imposed for permitted developments under the terms of Class B of part 1 of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 2) (England) Order 2008.  The submission  fails to demonstrate that the works would constitute permitted development within the meaning of the Order."
