    "REASON: The fins proposed pursuant to condition 17 of planning permission ref: P091052 would not provide adequate screening to prevent close, horizontal, mutual overlooking between bedroom 1 of flat 5 and bedroom 1 of flat 16 at mezzanine level, and between bedroom 2 of flat 17 and bedroom 1 of flat 24 at first floor level. The resultant development would provide a poor level of privacy for its occupants and is therefore contrary to policies H3, H7 and D3 of the Unitary Development Plan 2002, and policy CS12 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011."
