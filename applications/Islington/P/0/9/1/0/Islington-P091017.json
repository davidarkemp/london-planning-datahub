    "REASON: The proposed rear roof extension by reason of its design, scale and massing would form an overdominant and obtrusive feature to the rear of the dwelling while failing to bear any relationship with the surrounding urban context. The extension would be visible from the public realm and would disrupt the uniform and rhythmic rooflines/roof forms which exist along this section of Calabria Road. The proposed development therefore is not considered to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Calabria Road conservation area. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policies D1, D4, D11, D24, D25 of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006 and Conservation Guidance Note 38."
