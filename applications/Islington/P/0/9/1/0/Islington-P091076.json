    "REASON: The proposed creation of a  first floor rear terrace by reason of its excessive design, scale and overall site coverage would form an overdominant and visually discordant feature to the rear of the dwelling to the detriment of the character and appearance of the Grade 2 Listed host building while having a significant adverse impact  on the adjoining residents amenity levels at lower ground floor level  in terms of an loss of privacy, overlooking  and increases in the levels of noise and disturbances coming from the use of the terrace. The development  is therefore considered to be contrary to Polices D1, D3, D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002  Islington's  Urban Design Guide 2006 and conservation guidance note 10."
