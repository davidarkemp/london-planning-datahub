    "REASON: The proposed extension and partial levelling of the buildings rear butterfly valley feature by virtue of its design, scale and visibility from the public realm, would result in the loss of an attractive butterfly feature to the rear of the host locally listed building which is considered to be an important visual feature which contributes to the existing character and appearance of the host building and its setting within the row of terraces along Richmond Avenue. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policies to D1 (Design), D4 (Urban Context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D25 (Roof extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islingtonâ€™s Urban Design Guidance 2006, conservation guidance note 10 and PPG 15."
