    "CONDITION: Prior to commencement of any site clearance and/or prior to any associated development activities an Arboricultural Method Statement (AMS), including a Tree Protection Plan and Construction Exclusion Zone providing detailed cross sections of proposed tree protection and ground protection in accordance with BS5837:2005 ‘Trees in relation to construction-Recommendations’ shall be submitted to and approved in writing  by the Principal Tree Officer prior to the erection of this hoarding.  All trees and tree root systems bordering and adjacent to the site shall be retained and adequately protected in accordance with BS 5837, 2005 'Trees in Relation to Construction'.  In particular the AMS must adequately describe how protected trees will be protected throughout the site clearance, excavation activities and construction both above ground and below ground and detail the method of landscaping within the Root Protection Area (RPA). The development must be carried out in accordance with the approved AMS\r\n\r\nTree protecting fencing shall consist of a rigid 2.4 metre OSB, exterior grade ply high sterling board hoarding or weld mesh.  Heras fencing in concrete, rubber or similar foot plates is not acceptable as a form of tree root protection.\r\n\r\nREASON: To ensure that proper and effective planning is given to the tree protection that can be fully integrated into the overall development management plans, budgets and schedules thereby enabling successful tree protection on site throughout the development process."
