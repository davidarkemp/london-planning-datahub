    "REASON: The proposed development would provide for a poor mix of unit types, an insufficient level of affordable housing and inappropriate tenure split within the affordable housing provision.  The development in these aspects fails to meet the housing needs of the borough and the Council’s aim to secure balanced and mixed communities, contrary to policy 3A.5, 3A.9 and 3A.10 of the London Plan 2008, policies H3, H14 and H15 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, the Islington’s Local Housing Needs Assessment (2008) and the GLA’s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance to the London Plan (2005)."
