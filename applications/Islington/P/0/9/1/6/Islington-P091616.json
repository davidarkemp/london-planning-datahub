    "REASON: The siting of the bin enclosure within the area immediately in front of the listed building would harm the setting and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building as a consequence of its prominent position, its appearance and the materials of which it would be formed. It would also be detrimental to the character and appearance of this part of the St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore conflict with the expectations of PPG15: Planning and the Historic Environment as well as those of Policies D22 and D24 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
