    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, by reason of its size, location and visibility, would be a dominant feature that does not respect the buidlings hierarchy of levels, and thus would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building, street scene and the wider Rosebery Avenue Conservation Area. The development is contrary to Policies D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extension), D22 (New Development) and D25 (Roof extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, the Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
