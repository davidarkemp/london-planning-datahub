    "REASON: The proposed three-storey extension on the boundary with Nos 248-252 York Way would cause serious enclosure and loss of light and outlook for residential occupiers of upper floors of the shop and residential properties at 248 and 250 York Way. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, which requires developments to safeguard daylight and sunlight to nearby property and minimise disturbance to their occupants."
