    "REASON: The height, width and projection of the proposed rear extension would represent an over-development and involve the blocking in of all original door and window openings to the stairwell. The erection of the extension would severely harm the character and appearance of the locally-listed building and of the Chapel Market/Penton Street Conservation Area. This would severely conflict with the expectations of Policies D1, D4, D11 and D28 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, the Design Guidelines for the Chapel Market/Penton Street Conservation Area and the requirements of PPG15: Planning and the Historic Environment that developments in conservation areas should preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the area."
