    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale and massing and poor choice of finishing materials would represent an unsightly interruption to the unaltered and uniform roof forms along this section of the terrace from 82-94 Moray Road. The proposed development would form a discordant feature when viewed from the surrounding streetscene and when read within its local context. The development  would have an adverse impact on the established character and appearance of the Moray Road and Woodfall Road street scene, the original building and the terrace to which it forms part. The proposal is contrary to policies D1, D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
