    "REASON: The viability of the  proposed conversion development relies on the internal re-configuration of the Grade II Listed Building in order to comply with the relevant Policies of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, along with the Islington Supplementary Planning Standards Guidelines (2002). The proposed internal works and alterations to the property are unacceptable as they would harm the historic character of the Grade II Listed Building and are contrary to PPG15 (Planning and the Historic Environment) and English Heritage's publication: London terrace houses 1660-1860."
