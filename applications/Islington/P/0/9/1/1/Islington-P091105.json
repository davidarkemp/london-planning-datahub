    "REASON: The adaptation of the former glass-block filled ground floor window opening in the flank wall of the property, by the removal of the brick apron below it and the fitting of a pair of clear-glazed patio doors, has enabled the activity of the living room to easily and directly spill out into the courtyard. It has resulted in the noise and activity associated with the living room having a direct impact on the rear rooms in neighbouring properties in Cloudesley Road, particularly those immediately adjacent in the basement and ground floor maisonette at 40 Cloudesley Road.  The retention of the adaptations would therefore conflict with the objectives of Policy D3 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan, which seeks to ensure that development minimises disturbance to occupants of adjoining buildings and respects their privacy."
