    "REASON: The proposed location of the cycle docking station within this section of White Lion Street is considered to give rise to serious and significant detrimental impacts in terms of incidences and opportunities for crime while undermining the real and perceived safety of potential users of the cycle docking station. The lack of any natural surveillance during the evening time and very limited pedestrian movements are considered to create an insecure development in this location. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to guidance contained within PPS 1  Sustainable Development and PPG13 Transport and policies ENV 12 (Community Safety), D3 ( Site Planning)  and T52 (Cyclists facilities) of Islingtonâ€™s Unitary Development Plan 2002."
