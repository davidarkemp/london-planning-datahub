    "REASON: The two residential units proposed to the rear on the Burder Street frontage would fail to provide an adequate standard of residential amenity as a result of the inadequate size, configuration and outlook of the semi-basement living-dining-kitchen in the maisonette Unit 2, the lack of direct sunlight to that room, the fact that the bedrooms in the proposed self-contained house identified on the submiited drawings as Unit 1 would not be either naturally lit or natural ventilated, and the failure to provide acceptable amenity space either for either Unit 1 or Unit 2. The proposal would therefore conflict with the requirements of Policies H3 and H10 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
