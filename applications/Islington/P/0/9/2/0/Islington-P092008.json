    "REASON: The excavation of the front garden area, the creation of a lightwell over 2m deep, bounded by protective railings or fencing, and the extension of the front bay downward to cellar level, would radically change the appearance of the building itself, and would destroy the mirror symmetry of the semi-detached villa pair of which it forms part. It would also be wholly out of keeping with its context given that the only properties on this side of the street with two-level bay windows have semi-basements and raised ground floors over half a storey above street level. The two-storey end-of-terrace property at 152 is entirely different in character, and is in any case unique in having a lightwell. The scheme would therefore conflict with the design principles laid down in Policies D1, D3, D4 and D11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, those set out in the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006, and the broad principles on quality of design underpinning Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development."
