    "REASON: The proposal by virtue of its excessive height, bulk and mass and unsympathetic design represents an overdevelopment of the site and would adversely impact on the character and appearance of the adjoining Upper Street and Canonbury Conservation Areas, the adjoining streetscenes, the setting of the grade II* listed Union Chapel buildings and would unduly disturb views of the Union Chapel local landmark (LL6). The proposal is therefore contrary to PPS5, policies: 4B.8; 4B.11 and 4B.12 of the London Plan 2008, policies: D1; D4; D5 and D18 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Highbury and Islington Station and Highbury Corner Planning Framework (2004)."
