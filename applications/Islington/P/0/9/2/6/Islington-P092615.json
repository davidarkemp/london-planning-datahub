    "The proposal has been refused following consideration of all the relevant policies in the Development Plan (Unitary development Plan 2002 and London Plan 2008 (consolidated with alterations since 2004)), Government Planning Policy Guidance/Statements and other material considerations.\r\n\r\nThe decision has been taken by officers under delegated powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tReason: The proposal would detract from the amenities of both the existing residents and the potential residents of the approved scheme to the rear of the property by reason of its significant detrimental impacts in terms of noise and disturbance from the condensor units. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Islingtonâ€™s Unitary Development Plan policies Env17 (Protecting amenity), and D3 (Design and Layout)."
