    "REASON: The proposed dormer window and associated roof terrace would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing building, nearby properties, and the wider Canonbury Conservation Area. This is by virtue of the design (in particular the materials and its lack of symmetry to the roof), which would be visible from both public and private viewpoints and so disrupt an unbroken roof line on the eastern side of Alwyne Place. The development is contrary to Policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D22 (New Development), D24 (Materials) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of Islington Council's Unitary Development Plan (2002), and the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines and section 2.4.2 of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
