    "REASON: Due to method of internal illumination the proposed signage would significantly harm the streetscene and would be visually intrusive when viewed from Liverpool Road and Bromfield Street. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the adjoining Conservation Area.  The proposal would also be contrary to policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alteration and Extensions) and ENV11 (Advertisements and Signs) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the guidance set out in the Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
