    "REASON: The shop front proposed including an external roller shutter is considered to be of poor design in its arrangement and materials.  Due to its design and location the proposal fails to preserve or enhance the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area and has a negative impact on the building. The proposal is contrary to policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D13 (Shop Fronts), D22 (New development), D24 (Materials) and CS4 (Shopfronts) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002) the objectives of the Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), and the guidance of the Islington Shop front Design Guide (2003)"
