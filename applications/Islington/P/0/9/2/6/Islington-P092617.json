    "REASON: The proposed studio units in the basement would not provide an adequate standard of residential amenity by virtue of poor natural daylight, sunlight and outlook. The unit proposed in the front part of the basement would also be below the minimum size set out in the Islington Planning Standards Guidelines 2002 for accommodation of this kind. The proposal would therefore conflict with the provisions of Policies D3 and H3 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002."
