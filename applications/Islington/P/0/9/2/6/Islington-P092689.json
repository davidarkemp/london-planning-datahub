    "REASON: The proposed cabinet, by reason of its prominent location on the footway in front of the adjacent Grade II Listed Buildings, would add clutter to the footway and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the nearby listed buildings and the wider Cross Street Conservation Area. The development is contrary to Policies Env10 (Street Furniture, Paving and Streetscene), D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D22 (New Development) and C17 (Telecommunications equipment) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines (2006)."
