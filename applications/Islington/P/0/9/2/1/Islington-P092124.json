    "REASON: The proposed glazed enclosure at first floor level by reason of its frontward protrusion beyond the established upper floor levels building lines along Holloway Road would form a discordant feature when viewed from the public realm. The proposed development fails to pay any account of its surrounding urban context and would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding St Mary’s Magdelene Conservation Area. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to polices D1, D4, D11, D24 of Islington’s Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington’s Urban Design Guidance 2006, St Mary’s Magdelene conservation guidance note and PPG 15."
