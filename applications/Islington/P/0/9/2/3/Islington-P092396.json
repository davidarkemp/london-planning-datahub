    "This proposal has been refused following consideration of all the relevant policies in the Development Plan (Unitary Development Plan 2002 and the London Plan 2008), Government Planning Policy Guidance/Statements and other material considerations.\r\n\r\n-\tThis decision was taken by the Planning Committee on 7 September 2010.\r\n\r\n1.\tThe proposed reduction of the units from 14 to 9 would result in the failure of the scheme to provide needed affordable housing in the borough and is considered to constitute threshold abuse. The current proposal would result in the under use of the application site and is thus is not considered to maximise the potential of this site.  The failure to provide affordable housing on the site would result in the loss of an opportunity to meet and identified need within the borough and would adversely affect the achievement of the borough affordable housing targets.  the scheme therefore does not comply with policies 3A.3 (Maximising the Potential of Sites), 3A.6 ( Quality of new housing Provision); 3A.9 (Affordable Housing Targets); 3A.10 (Negotiating Affordable Housing in individual private residential and mixed use schemes,), 3A.11 (Affordable Housing Thresholds) of the London Plan 2008; and polices, H7 (Standards and Guidelines), H10 (New Developments), H14 &H15 (Dwelling Mix, Dwelling need and Affordable Housing) and Imp5 ( Efficient Use) of the Islington UDP 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe scheme does not incorporate any amenity space for the units in the form of a rear garden especially for the family units and does therefore not accord with the provisions of policies D3 (Site Planning) and D6 (Landscaping) of the Islington UDP. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tThe design of the proposed development is considered to be incongruous in the urban setting and is not considered to efficiently address the constraints of the site. The proposed amendments do not result in a design which is appropriate to the overall streetscape or respects the scale, form and character of the locality. The development is not considered to be acceptable in design terms and therefore does not accord with  policies D1 (Overall Design), D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D6 &D7 (Landscaping and public facilities),D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington UDP 2002 and policies; 4B.1 (Design Principles for a Compact City), 4B.3 (Enhancing the Quality of the Public Realm), 4B.4 (London's Buildings retrofitting), 4B.5 (Creating an Inclusive Environment) of the London Plan 2008 ( consolidated with Alterations since 2004).\r\n\r\n4. \tThe proposed wheelchair accessible unit within the proposal does not accord with the principles of inclusive design as set down in the London Plan; the unit is split level with the bedrooms located on the lower floor. The presence of a staircase in the absence of an appropriate lift creates a disabling barrier which makes it difficult for a person in a wheelchair to use the space within the unit, easily, without undue effort, and with dignity. The proposed wheelchair accessible units are therefore not accessible, usable and permeable for all users. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the requirements of policies 4B.1 (Design Principles for a Compact City), and 4B.5 (Creating an Inclusive Environment) of the London Plan, 2008 (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004)."
