    "REASON: The proposed erection of a three storey rear extension by reason of excessive scale, bulk and massing is considered to form an overdominant development which would bear no relationship to the existing scale and context of the host building and which would result in an overdevelopment of the site. The rear extension is also considered to have a severe detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host building and its setting within the Highbury Fields Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to polices D1 (Overall design), D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006, Conservation Guidance Note 5 and PPS5."
