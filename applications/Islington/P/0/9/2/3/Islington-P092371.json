    "REASON : The proposed extension to the rear of the property is considered by reason of its design, scale and siting to have a poor relationship with the main property and disrupt the unity and rhythm of the rear terrace.  The rear extension is considered to have a unacceptable detrimental effect on the character and appearance of the area being visible and prominent within the public realm from Landseer Gardens Open space and surrounding streets.  The proposal is not considered to comply with the objectives of policies D1 (Overall Design), D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Extensions and Alterations) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and part 2.5 of the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006"
