    "This approval is for the Written Scheme of Investigation for an Archaeological Evaluation & Watching Brief dated 8th June 2010 that has been submitted. However, further archaeological works will be required when large-scale excavation of the site is undertaken and a further report will therefore  be required that will be subject to subsequent approval. Consequently, the current approval represents only a partial discharge of condition 8; the condition will not be fully discharged until the final report is submitted and approved and all of the works are complete."
