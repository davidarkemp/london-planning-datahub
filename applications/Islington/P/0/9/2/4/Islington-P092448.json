    "The Local Planning Authority considers the siting of the kiosk to be unacceptable, as it would be an unattractive addition adding unnecessary clutter and harm its character and appearance.. A condition attached to Part 24 of the General Permitted Development Order 2001 states that such development should be sited to minimise its impact, and thus any future planing application would need to address the issue regarding the siting of the kiosk."
