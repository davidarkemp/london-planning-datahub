    "The site lies immediately adjacent to the south of the Kings Cross Conservation Area as designated in the Islington Unitary Plan, second deposit version, 2000, as such the Conservation Team has been consulted regarding the application, and have made the following comments; \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n A simple glass front seems to have been replaced by a complicated one. Suggest keep regular pattern of panels as at present, generally with vertical emphasis and minimise material types. The facade design becomes a lot more important if it is brought forward to back of pavement here."
