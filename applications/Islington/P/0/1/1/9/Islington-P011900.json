    "INFORMATIVE: The planning permission of 6th March 1997 (decision reference 96/1577) allowed the division of the fifth floor penthouse into two flats. The Local Planning Authority notes that it has not in fact been implemented. Conditions 2 and 3 of that permission would only come into effect if a start were made on the approved scheme within the time frame allowed under condition 1. As of now this is obviously not the case. Conditions 2 and 3 of decision 96/1577 are therefore not currently applicable and thus there is presently no obligation in respect of them. If the permission is still unimplemented after 6th March 2002 it will of course automatically become null and void."
