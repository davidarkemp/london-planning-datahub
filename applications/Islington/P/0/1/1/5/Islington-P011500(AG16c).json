    "REASON: The proposed coach parking locations are considered unacceptable due to their impact on the amenity and safety of existing residents, there is also a lack of information provided as to other alternative sites that may have a lesser impact, and consequently the failure to propose a long-term solution. This is contrary to policies Env12, Env17, T10, T55, and V7 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002) and policies 3C.1, 3C.2, 3C.3, 3C.4, 3C.17, 3C.18, 3C.20 and 3C.23 of the London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004)."
