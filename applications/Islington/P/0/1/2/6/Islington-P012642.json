    "REASON: The proposed two internally illuminated wall mounted signs and one internally freestanding advertisement sign by reason of their siting and illumination would constitute unsightly, discordant, disruptive and obtrusive features in the streetscape, and would also result in an over proliferation of signs in the locality, detrimental to the visual amenities of adjacent residents and the area generally, contrary to Policy Env 9 of the Council's Unitary Development Plan."
