    "The London Borough of Islington would like to make the following observations in respect of this proposal:- \r\n\r\n 1. Residential Accommodation - To the extent that the proposed scheme retains two flats on the site and provides additional facilities such that they can be self-contained rather than having shared facilities, the scheme would improve the standard of accommodation provided. \r\n\r\n 2. Character and Appearance - The existing terrace, of which this property forms the southern end building, has a generally uniform roofline with a consistent front parapet line, (except for minor steps down from north to south). There are no visible extensions at roof level. We are concerned that the proposed mansard roof extension would be visible from Stroud Green Road and would represent a visually obtrusive feature in the streetscene. As such the proposed extension would be inappropriate and out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original building and the terrace of which it forms a part. \r\n\r\n 3. We are concerned that the proposed porch is an incongruous feature in the streetscene and consider that adequate access to both flats could be provided without need for this extension. \r\n\r\n 4. If planning permission is granted for the scheme, we would request that the following conditions be imposed: \r\n\r\n i) all new external work to be carried out in materials of such colour and texture with architectural detailing to match existing facing work of the building, in order to ensure a satisfactory external appearance; ii) adequate on-site covered refuse and recyclables storage space to be provided, in order to ensure that streetscape and neighbourhood amenities are maintained."
