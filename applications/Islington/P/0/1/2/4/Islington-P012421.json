    "I advise that the London Borough of Islington has no objection in principle to the erection of a single storey rear extension in connection with the proposed change of use to restaurant/take-away and erection of an extract duct and flue to the rear. \r\n\r\n However, we would request that if consent is granted, the following measures be implemented: \r\n\r\n 1. All new external work to be carried out in materials to match existing facing work of the building, in order to ensure a satisfactory external appearance. \r\n\r\n 2. Adequate on-site covered refuse and recyclables storage space to be provided, in order to ensure that streetscape and neighbourhood amenities are maintained. \r\n\r\n 3. Ground floor WC to Building Regulations Part M standard to be provided, to aid access and usability of the premises for people with disabilites. \r\n\r\n 4. Level entry access to be provided, to aid access and usability of the premises for people with disabilities or those with double buggies."
