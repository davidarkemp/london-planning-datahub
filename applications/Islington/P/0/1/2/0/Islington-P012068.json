    "Your attention is drawn to the condition requiring effective sound insulation between the use hereby approved and neighbouring use(s). You must not assume that automatic compliance with this condition would result by providing insulation levels which meet Part E of Building Regulations. A higher level of sound insulation would be expected by the Local Planning Authorty, to protect neighbouring amenity from potential or possible noise that could arise from this use in future and you are advised to consult with the Council's Environmental Health Noise Team in ascertaining the appropriate adequate level of insulaton. It is important to note that although a particular proposed operation for the property at this stage may not generate high levels of noise, it could in future be substituted by different, more noisy, operation (involving amplified music etc.) without the need for planning permission and the Council needs to protect neighbouring amenity at this stage."
