    "The London Borough of Islington objections to the proposals for the following reasons: \r\n\r\n 1. The excessive scale of the development would have an adverse impact on the Moorfields Conservation Area and on the setting of a number of locally listed buildings. 2. The existing building (4 storeys) contributes positively to the existing character of the area. 3. The proposed design appears to be extremely unsympathetic to its surroundings."
