    "This Authority raises no objection to the development in principle, although concern is expressed at the excessive height of the proposed building compared to the general prevailing scale of the nearby Broadgate development which should be respected. The proposed height is considered to be inappropriate both with regard to the scale and characater of the immediate area and with the likely adverse affect on views within and across this part of the City fringe. Also, it is considered that excessive car parking provision is proposed. A significant reduction should be achieved in this accessible location close to a major public transport interchange."
