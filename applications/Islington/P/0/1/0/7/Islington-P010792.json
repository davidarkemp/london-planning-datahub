    "This Council objects to the proposal since it would lead to an increase in traffic contrary to the strategic policy objective contained in the Islington Unitary Development Plan to improve the quality of the local environment through a substantial and progressive reduction in the volume of motor traffic on all roads within Islington. The temporary nature of the proposal does not mitigate this objection in principle."
