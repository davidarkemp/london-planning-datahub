The proposals would therefore, adversely affect the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building, and cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to the objectives of Chapter 16 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policy 7.8 (Sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and Policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
