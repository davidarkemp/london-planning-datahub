    "Reason : 1 - REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate scale, design and prominent siting would form a discordant and dominant addition that would disrupt the harmonious roof form of the unaltered terrace of Sheringham Road and Hides Street.  The proposal would be readily visible from Sheringham Road and Hides Street and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and wider area, including nearby locally listed buildings.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and the Urban Design Guide 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - REASON: The proposed roof extension, by reason of its inappropriate scale, massing siting and proximity to other residential properties would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of adjacent and nearby residential buildings through unacceptable loss of sunlight/daylight, loss of privacy, loss of outlook, overbearing impacts and sense of enclosure contrary to London Plan policy 7.6, Policy DM 2.1 of Islington's Local Plan: Development Management Policies (2013) and BRE 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice' (Second Edition 2011)."
