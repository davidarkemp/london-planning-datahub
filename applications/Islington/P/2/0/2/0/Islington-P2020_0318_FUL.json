    "REASON: The proposed development, by reason of its inappropriate siting, excessive scale, height, and massing would be highly visible in appearance and discordant with the adjacent terrace of which it would abut thereby reducing the visual openness of the site when viewed from both the public and private realm whilst also contributing to a loss of private open space.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy CS8 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011; Policies DM2.1 and DM3.6 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
