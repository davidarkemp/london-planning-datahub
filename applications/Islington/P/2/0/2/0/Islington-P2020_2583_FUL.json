    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its  inappropriate design, scale and bulk together with its promiinent location and siting would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host building and wider settings of the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The development would be visible from the surrounding private and public realm causing clear harm to the character and appearance of the Barnsbury  Conservation Area.  The proposed development  therefore considered to be contrary to policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Barnsbury Conservation Guideline 2002 and the NPPF 2019."
