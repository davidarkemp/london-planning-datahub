    "REASON: The proposed works, consisting of the rear extension by virtue of its inappropriate height and elevational detail, and primarily the interior works by their detailed design and layout, would create a detrimental impact on the special interest of the listed building, including impact on character and appearance, loss of historic fabric and deterioration of any remaining historic plan form. The works would therefore cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
