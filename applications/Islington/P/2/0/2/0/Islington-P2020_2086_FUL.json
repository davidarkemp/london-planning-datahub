Therefore the proposal would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and to the character and visual amenity of the surrounding area contrary to Core Strategy policy CS8, Development Management Policy DM2.1 and draft Local Plan policies PLAN1 and DH2 and the design guidance contained within Islington's Urban Design SPD (2017)."
