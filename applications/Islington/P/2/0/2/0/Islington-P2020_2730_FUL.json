    "The proposed extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing and siting is considered to form an incongruous and discordant feature when seen from the private realm and result in a loss of the open character. The proposal would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host property, the terrace it forms apart of and the wider conservation area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017, and the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
