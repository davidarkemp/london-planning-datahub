    "REASON: The proposed roof access enclosure by reason of its inappropriate design, prominent siting, appearance, materials and height would form a discordant addition causing unnecessary visual clutter when seen from the surrounding public and private realm. The proposal would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace and surrounding area. The proposal is contrary to policy CS8 of the Core Strategy 2011, DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2017 and the NPPF 2019."
