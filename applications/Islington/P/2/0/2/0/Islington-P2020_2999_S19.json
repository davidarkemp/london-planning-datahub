    "REASON: The retained works including the opening within the rear ground floor elevation, the loss of the window and apron, the window seat, new door, porch and store at first floor level, and three-storey glazing link with passenger lift cause harm to historic plan form of the listed building and result in alteration which harms the special architectural and historic interest of the heritage asset. The proposal to retain these alterations therefore adversely affects the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building, and causes harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to the objectives of Chapter 16 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policy HC1 (Sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and Policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
