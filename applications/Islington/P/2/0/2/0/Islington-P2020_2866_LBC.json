    "REASON: The proposed works of extension and alterations, by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, on historic fabric, on setting and character and by reason of unsympathetic design and inadequate information would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would, therefore cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage asset, with no public benefit which outweighs this harm, contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
