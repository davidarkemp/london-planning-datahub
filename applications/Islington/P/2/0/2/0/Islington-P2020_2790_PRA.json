    "REASON: Due to their siting, distribution across the rooftop, appearance and visibility in short views from the surrounding public realm the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as visually alien and discordant additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location, cluttering the roof. This would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the building and streetscene and the nearby Barnsbury Conservation Area and Edward Square designated area of Open Space (OS54). The proposals are therefore contrary policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
