    "REASON: The proposed works of introducing a roof terrace at Ground Floor level over the proposed extension and the external staircase to the garden by virtue of their unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the host listed building and as such would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the wider Conservation Area setting. As such, the proposals are contrary to policies DC4 (Delivering Good Design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's Character) CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 (design) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, as well as the guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017"
