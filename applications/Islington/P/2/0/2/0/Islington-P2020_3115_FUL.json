    "Reason : 1 - REASON: The proposed open front lightwell and railings would result in a dominant and discordant addition to the front of the application building which would be harmful to the established character and appearance of the host building, including its locally listed shopfront, and the streetscene.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM 4.8 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), guidance within Islington's Urban Design Guidance (2017) and the Islington Basement Development (2016) SPD.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - REASON: The loss of the existing shopfront would result in harm to the visual appearance and historic character of the locally listed building and the wider streetscene and there are insufficient public benefits to outweigh this harm.  The proposed replacement shopfront design is also considered to be inappropriate.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1 and DM4.8 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017.\r\n"
