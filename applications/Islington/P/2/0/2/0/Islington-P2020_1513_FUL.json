    "REASON: The newly  erected timber shed to the rear portion of the garden by reason of its excessive size, massing and width would form a dominant feature within the rear garden due to its large footprint that is not set in from the garden walls/ boundary walls contrary to guidance in the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017.  The works would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of the Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013 and guidance contained within Islington's Urban Design Guide Guidelines 2017."
