    "REASON: The proposed mansard roof extension by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, scale, height, massing and siting is considered to form a dominant and discordant feature which would harmfully interrupt the existing predominantly unaltered roofline which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host property, wider terrace setting and the surrounding conservation area being readily visible from the surrounding public realm. The proposed development is considered to be contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy (2011); DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management policies 2013, the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Urban Design Guidelines 2017."
