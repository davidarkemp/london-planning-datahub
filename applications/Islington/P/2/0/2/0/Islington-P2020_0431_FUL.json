    "REASON: The proposed first floor extension by virtue of the inappropriate detailed design, height, massing and form would from a discordant and clumsy addition to the host property jarring visually with the existing buildings main rear eaves line. The proposal would be clearly visible from the surrounding public realm over short and medium views and is therefore considered to adversely affect the special character and appearance of the host building and the wider Canonbury Conservation Area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the Conservation Area contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Canonbury CA guidance and guidance within Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
