    "REASON 01: The proposed development and alterations to the garages main roof by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, siting, form, massing, bulk and height would appear as a excessively dominant and discordant addition to the host semi-detached property, symmetry of the pair of properties, wider streetscene and would harmfully erode the open character in and around the site whilst being readily visible from short and longer views from both the public and private realms. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Policy 2013, Islington' s Urban Design Guide 2017 & The NPPF 2019."
