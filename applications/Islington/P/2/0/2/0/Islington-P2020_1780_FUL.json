    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate and prominent siting, design, scale, bulk, height and massing would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host building and wider terrace setting. The development would interrupt a predominantly unaltered rear and front roofline within this section of the terrace to a harmful degree and would be harmfully  visible from the surrounding public and private realm causing harm to the character and appearance of the East Canonbury Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the NPPF 2019."
