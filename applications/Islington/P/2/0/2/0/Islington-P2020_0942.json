  "description": "We understand that a cherry tree in our neighbour's garden (at 4 Highbury Hill) is subject to a Tree Protection Order. We, together with our neighbour, need to repair and rebuild a section of our party wall that is near to the cherry tree. This is because the wall is leaning due to a difference of height between our gardens. This lean poses a safety risk on our side of the garden and the work is therefore necessary. All work will be done from our side of the wall (2 Highbury Hill) and no work will be done to the tree itself, we are just seeking approval as a precaution and a courtesy. The work will involve: - taking down a section of the wall (around 2-3m length) brick-by-brick and installing a new foundation - rebuilding the wall using the same bricks (London stock bricks) as far as possible. If the same bricks are damaged, then new identical bricks will be bought and used as a supplement. - finishing the wall in an identical manner to its current appearance - cleaning the site",
