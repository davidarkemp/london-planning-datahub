    "REASON: The proposed roof extensions, by reason of its inappropriate detailed design including materials, prominent siting, form, scale, massing, height and overall bulk would represent a dominant and discordant/incongruous addition that would be a wholly uncharacteristic feature to the existing building, impacting on the setting of the adjacent listed building and wider Clerkenwell Green conservation area.  For these reasons the proposed development would cause clear visual harm to the appearance of the host building and wider urban and conservation area setting and therefore clearly fails to preserve the character and appearance of the wider conservation area. It is therefore contrary NPPF 2019; policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan; policy CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011; policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013 along with the guidance contained within the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
