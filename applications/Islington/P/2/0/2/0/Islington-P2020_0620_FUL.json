    "REASON: The proposed second floor level extension, by reason of its excessive and inappropriate scale, height, massing, siting and detailed design, is considered to form a dominant and discordant feature which would harmfully interrupt the existing unaltered roofline of the housing block and would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host building the wider streetscene and the adjacent Conservation Area being readily visible from the surrounding public realm. The proposed development is considered to be contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy (2011); DM2.1 of the Development Management policies 2013, and the Islington Urban Design Guidelines 2017."
