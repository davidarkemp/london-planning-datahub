  "description": "To remove a stud wall (non load baring) and rebuild a new wall 58cm adjacent to the original wall. The proposed wall is between our bathroom and our storage room. As per the surveyors report, this wall has been confirmed as a non-load baring stud (timber) wall approx 100mm thick. The surveyors have identified a \"Bulkhead beam... accepting overhead load and not transferring any loads upon the subject wall\". The report also includes the drawing of existing and proposed changes. We are proposing to make our bathroom smaller and storage room larger (by 58cm). Our current storage room is 158cm \"wide\" by 208cm \"deep\". The depth would remain the same but width would increase to 216cm. Our bathroom measures : 305cm wide, 230cm deep. We are the leas-holders to the 1 bedroom Flat (with a 121 years remaining leas) and we have contacted the freeholders (Islington Home ownership services) who have visited the property (pre-covid situation) and agreed the work to be carried out with condition of this planing application. The main reason for this application/request is that we have recently had a baby and we are in need of more storage space at the cost of reducing a very generous sized bathroom. We aim/hope to carry out work before the end of October if permission granted. I hope these are sufficient information but if not please let us know and we will respond promptly.",
