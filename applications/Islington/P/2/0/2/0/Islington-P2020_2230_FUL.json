    "REASON: The proposed second floor level rear extension by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, siting, scale, bulk, massing and height would form a dominant and discordant addition to the rear of the host property and wider terrace setting. The development would be readily visible from the surrounding private realm and would fail to be a subservient addition to the host property.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013, guidance within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the NPPF 2019."
