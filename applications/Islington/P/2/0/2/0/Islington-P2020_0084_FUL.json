    "REASON: The proposed second floor level rear extension by reason of its inappropriate scale, prominent siting, height and depth would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host property and wider terrace setting. The addition would be readily visible from the surrounding public realm and would cause clear visual harm, including less than substantial harm to the setting of the nearby Grade II listed building at No. 147 Hornsey Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
