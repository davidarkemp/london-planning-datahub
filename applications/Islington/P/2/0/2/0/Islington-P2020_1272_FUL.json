    "REASON: The proposed roof extension and terrace by reason of its inappropriate location and siting would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host locally listed building and wider terrace setting. The development would interrupt a predominantly unaltered rear roof line within this section of the terrace to a harmful degree and would be readily visible from the surrounding private realm causing harm to the character and appearance of the East Canonbury Conservation Area.  The proposed development s therefore considered to be contrary to policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013; and guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the NPPF 2019."
