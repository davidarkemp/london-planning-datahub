    "REASON: The proposed replacement UPVC windows are unacceptable by virtue of their poor quality design, inappropriate materials, thickness and appearance which would form a visually discordant feature when seen from the surrounding public realm that would harm the significance of the non-designated heritage building and would harm the visual amenity of the area.   The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy 12 of the NPPF, policy CS9 of the Core Strategy, policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
