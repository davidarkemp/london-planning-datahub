    "REASON: The proposed redevelopment of Noâ€™s. 270 and 272 Holloway Road by reason of its excessive siting, bulk, massing, height and depth would represent a discordant dominant form of development which would be readily visible form the surrounding public and private realm. As such, it would both harm and overwhelm the character and appearance of the host building, terrace setting and the wider streetscene.  In addition, the proposed new building due to its poor quality design including projecting balconies, a contrived fenestration patterns, render materials,  roof level railings and lift overrun, and shopfront design would appear stark, visually oppressive and alienlike within its immediate setting. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM2.1 (design) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013 and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
