    "REASON: The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of the dominant addition to the building, its discordant relationship above the existing single storey rear wing, harm to fabric and expression of rear elevation chimney stack and loss of architectural design balance and symmetry with 58 Canonbury Park South, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and its setting, and the wider Canonbury Conservation Area. The works would cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets, with no public benefit which outweighs this harm, contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
