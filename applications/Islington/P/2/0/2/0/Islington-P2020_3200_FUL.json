    "REASON: The proposed roof extensions and amenity terrace and by reason of its inappropriate location, siting, and overall incongruous design would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host building and wider terrace setting. The development would interrupt a predominantly unaltered and uniform front and rear roof line within the terrace to a harmful degree and would be readily visible from the surrounding public and private realm causing harm to the character and appearance of the Highbury New Park Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013; and guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017, the Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the NPPF 2019."
