    "The proposed works by virtue of their harm to plan form and historic circulation, unsympathetic design and through lack of information would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building as well as detracting from the character and appearance of the conservation area.  The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington’s Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
