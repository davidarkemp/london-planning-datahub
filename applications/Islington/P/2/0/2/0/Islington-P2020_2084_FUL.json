    "REASON: The proposed extensions, due to their inappropriate design, siting,  scale, height, massing and bulk would form a dominant and discordant addition to the property being readily visible from the public and private realm. The proposed development would subsume the host building creating a disproportionate addition the host building and wider urban setting causing clear harm to the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene, and wider Charterhouse Square Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within Islington's Urban Design Guide and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
