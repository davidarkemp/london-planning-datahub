    "Reason: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, scale, height, massing and form would form a discordant and dominant addition that would clearly disrupt the predominantly unaltered and rhythmic existing front and rear roofline as well as removing the characteristic and legible rear valley roof profile thereby harming the rear elevations of the host building and the wider terrace setting. The proposed roof extension would be readily visible from both short and longer viewpoints from the surrounding public and private realm and would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace setting and the surrounding conservation area. Therefore, it is considered contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017, and the East Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
