    "REASON: The proposed works by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, detrimental impact on architectural significance and loss of historic fabric would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would, therefore cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage asset, with no public benefit which outweighs this harm, contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
