    "REASON: The proposed works by virtue of inappropriate detailed design, prominent siting would form dominant and discordant features when seen from the public and private realm. The proposed development would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the host listed building and wider New River Conservation Area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of these heritage assets contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
