Based on the email and technical report submitted by CSG Ushers on 10 June 2020, I am satisfied that both trees represent an urgent health and safety risk (due to their poor structural condition) and can therefore be removed without the express consent of this Council being required. Removal of the trees is consistent with Part 3, 14 & 15 (Exemptions) of the Town and Country Planning (Tree Preservation) (England) Regulations 2012, which provides for the removal of protected trees which are dead or dangerous.\r\n\r\nPlease note that under planning legislation there is a legal duty to plant a replacement tree when a tree is removed under this exemption to the usual requirements of the legislation. In this instance, two replacement trees will be required, to be planted as close as practicable to the location of the original trees by the end of the first planting season following its removal (Oct 2020 - April 2021). The trees should be a standard sized nursery tree, container grown specimen with a minimum stem girth of 12-14cm at planting. The position and species of the replacement tree are to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to planting taking place. Details of soil preparation, staking, irrigation and maintenance of the tree are also to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to planting taking place and will need to comply with the recommendations contained with BS8545 (2014) Trees: From Nursery to independence in the landscape. To confirm compliance with this requirement a photo of the planted tree should be submitted to the planning tree officer via planning (planning@islington.gov.uk) quoting the planning address and \"dead, dangerous tree replacement\".\r\n\r\nTo help the establis",
