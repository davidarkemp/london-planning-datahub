    "- While it is appreciated that tall buildings exist to the South and East of Finsbury Square, the proposed development is considered to be visually obtrusive and to the detriment of the setting of the Bunhill Fields and Finsbury Square Conservation Area. Compared to the previously approved building, the proposed development represents an increase in bulk, height and scale. Views 16, 17 and 18 show that the proposed towers would loom over Finsbury Square, harming the character and appearance of the conservation area.\r\n- Should planning permission be granted by the City of London for the proposed development, and should adjacent footways and highways (within Islington) be damaged during demolition and construction, appropriate reinstatement will need to be funded by the developer.\r\n- LB Islington would welcome appropriate public realm improvements to the streets within Islington close to the application site. In addition, given that staff of the proposed development are likely to rely heavily on Finsbury Square as the nearest significant area of public open space to the application site, it would be appropriate for contributions towards public realm improvements in this location to be secured via a Section 106 agreement. Public space priority project 22 - described at appendix 2 of the Finsbury Local Plan - sets out the improvements LB Islington intends to implement in Finsbury Square. It may also be appropriate to direct Section 106 funding towards other projects within Islington (but within the vicinity of the application site) that would improve conditions for pedestrians and cyclists, and would benefit residents, staff and visitors of/to both the City of London and LB Islington. A co-ordinated approach (between LB Islington, the City of London and LB Hackney) to public realm and related improvements would be appropriate, and officers can be available for discussions in the near future.\r\n - Given the likely noise impacts during construction, and the length of the construction period, construction monitoring will be necessary. Given the proximity of the site to noise-sensitive properties in Islington, monitoring fees secured by the City of London (if permission is granted) should be shared with LB Islington to cover officer time."
