    "INFORMATIVE: The non-completion of a Unilateral Undertaking for the payment of contributions for small sites payments towards affordable housing has not been included as a reason for refusal in this instance, as the applicant had signed an agreement with the LPA which agreed to pay full small sites payments towards affordable housing. This however has not yet been fully secured with a final legal agreement. \r\n\r\nThe applicant is therefore reminded that if they seek to appeal this decision, a signed completed Unilateral Undertaken to pay full contribution towards affordable housing shall be completed prior to the lodging of an appeal in order to comply with the LPA policy position on small sites contributions. \r\n\r\nIf this Unilateral Undertaken is not finalised prior to an appeal being lodged, the LPA will require the legal agreement to be secured prior to the determination of the appeal or may seek a further reason for refusal on small sites grounds to be added during the appeal process. This is to ensure the scheme fully complies with CS12 of Islington Core Strategy 2011 and the Small Site Affordable Housing Contributions SPD 2013."
