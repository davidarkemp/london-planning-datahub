    "REASON: The proposed lowering of the floor level of the extension by 0.3m with the increase in the scale of the extension, and glazing, and additional excavation  would represent material alterations to the previously approved scheme. The alterations may therefore give rise to design and amenity implications which would need to be fully assessed within a Section 73 or Full Planning application. Therefore, the proposed amendment would constitute a material amendment to the approved scheme and the non-material amendments proposed within this application are not agreed."
