    "REASON: The proposed shopfront alterations by reason of the poor detailed design and unsympathetic proportions, demonstrates poor design which is detrimental to the visual appearance and character of the locally listed host building, street scene and the wider Kings Cross Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policy DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM4.8 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017), and the Kings Cross Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
