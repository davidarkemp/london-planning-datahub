    "REASON: The proposal fails to provide details of plant to the ground or basement floors or sufficient realistic detail in relation to the control of noisy public house related activities and mitigation for the residential occupiers of the building.  This, in combination with the need to protect residential amenity to the proposed flats on upper floor, is likely to result in an unviable and compromised public house in the short, medium and long terms. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 3.1B and 4.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policies DM2.1 Part A(xi), DM3.7 and DM4.10 of the Development Management Policies 2013."
