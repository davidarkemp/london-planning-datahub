    "REASON: The proposed extension, by reason of its height, depth and location would block light to the majority of the glazed brick openings within the south elevation of 351 Holloway Road which would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight and sunlight to the neighbouring artist/design workshop and would cause significant harm to the operation of this premises as a result of loss of light. The proposed development is therefore harmful to the work environment of the neighbouring property and is contrary to policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2015."
