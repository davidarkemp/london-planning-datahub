    "REASON: The proposed generic Class E use, by reason of the site's backland location, proximity to existing residential units, location outside of a Town Centre, relatively large size, limited access and servicing provision and insufficient information submitted with the application, would cause harm to the amenity of adjacent and nearby residential buildings, the vitality and viability of Town Centres in the borough and harm the highway network.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CS8, CS9 and CS13 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1, DM2.3, DM4.2, DM4.3, DM4.4, DM4.12, DM5.1, DM8.2, DM8.4 and DM8.6 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, location and concentration of uses SPD 2016."
