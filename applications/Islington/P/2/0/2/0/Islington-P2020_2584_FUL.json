    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, prominent siting, height, bulk and form would from dominant and discordant additions to the host property and wider terrace setting. The development would clearly disrupt the predominantly unaltered and rhythmic existing front and rear roofline and would be visible from both the surrounding public and private realm. The proposal is therefore considered to adversely affect the special character and appearance of the host buildings, wider terrace setting and the surrounding Barnsbury Conservation Area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the Conservation Area contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policies 7.4, 7.6 & 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Barnsbury CA guidance and guidance within Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
