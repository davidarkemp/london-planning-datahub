    "REASON: The proposed extension over the existing two and a half storey rear addition, by reason of excessive scale, bulk, massing and height, would form a dominant and harmful addition that would be readily visiblle from the surrounding public realm and would unacceptably harm the character and appearance of the property, the terrace and the wider conservation area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
