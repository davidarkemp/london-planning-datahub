Where possible, the smallest pruning wound point will be used. To shorten the canopy projection, eastward toward road from 10m, by 2-3m leaving a canopy spread of around 7m. All pruning to be done to suitable growth points. Undertake canopy clean (removing crossing / rubbing branches, stubs, and deadwood) and complete an upper canopy structural branch Massaria inspection with a London Tree Officer Association (TLOA) assessment form.\r\n\r\nNext to 213 City Road (Shoreditch Grill)\r\n(T2) London Plane - Reduce 3/4 tips back from office block building (south west side) to leave at main canopy line radius at around 7m. Remove low branches resting on / touching roof of the Shoreditch Grill. The east spread toward the road, to reduce limb over street lamp by shortening main branch, and secondary by around 1.5m behind the lamp to appropriate pruning points, leaving a canopy spread of 7m. Reduce back canopy over underground access by around 1-2m, to reflect line of interconnecting lamppost wires, to stop damage to cables and overextended canopy. Undertake canopy clean (removing crossing / rubbing branches, stubs, and deadwood) and complete an upper canopy structural branch Massaria inspection with a London Tree Officer Association (TLOA) assessment form.",
