    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, by reason of its prominent siting, scale, bulk and massing, would form a dominant and discordant feature that is visible from the surrounding public realm (including a designated area of open space) over short and longer viewpoints and would interrupt the hierarchy of buildings and be harmful to the character and appearance of the host locally listed building, wider terrace settings including the adjacent Grade II listed buildings, and the Clerkenwell Conservation Area. There are no public benefits to outweigh this harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington Core Strategy (2011) and Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Development Management Policies (2013) and the design advice found the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017), Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines & The NPPF 2019."
