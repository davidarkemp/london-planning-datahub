  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - REASON: The proposed mixed use redevelopment within the designated Finsbury Town Centre would fail to incorporate the maximum amount of business floorspace reasonably possible on site. Furthermore, the proposal has failed to provide the maximum reasonable level of affordable housing, taking account of the borough-wide strategic target of 50% and the financial viabity of the proposal. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to the Core Strategy (2011) policies CS12 and CS13, Development Management Policies (2013) DM5.1 and DM9.2, the Affordable Housing Small Sites Contributions SPD (2012) and the Development Viability SPD (2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - REASON: The proposed development, by reason of its design and materials, would not create a form of development that relates to the existing built form and provide a consistent and coherent setting for the space or street that it defines or encloses, nor would it enhance and complement the local identity of an area including the setting of its heritage assets. The proposals would be contrary to policy and guidance contained within the Development Management Policies (2013) DM2.1 and DM2.3 Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)",
    "Reason : 3 - REASON: The submitted daylight/sunlight assessment, due to the lack of a completed assessment on daylight distribution, has failed to demonstrate how an acceptable level of amenity would be maintained to the surrounding residential units, particularly in respect to levels of daylight. The proposal has also failed to address the potential amenity impact to the consented residential units at 139-149 Fonthill Road. The proposals are therefore contrary to policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013) and guidance contained with the BRE Site Layout Planning for Daylight and Sunlight (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - REASON: The proposed development would result in inadequate provision of cycle parking and refuse and recycling storage on site for the commercial units, the proposal is therefore contrary with Core Strategy (2011) policy CS11, policies DM2.1, DM8.4, DM8.6 and Appendix 6 of the Development Management Policies (2013), as well as the guidance within the Islington's Recycling and Refuse Storage Requirements.",
    "Reason : 5 - REASON: In the absence of an appropriate Section 106 legal agreement, the application fails to provide measures to ensure that impacts arising from the new development are adequately addressed. The required obligations includes off-site contributions for affordable housing and carbon offsetting, and as such the proposal fails to accord with policies CS10, CS12 and CS18 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM7.2, DM8.5, DM9.1 and DM9.2 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), Islington's Planning Obligations SPD (2016), Development Viability SPD (2016), the Affordable Housing Small Sites Contributions SPD (2012) and Environmental Design SPD (2012)."
