The addition would be readily visible from the surrounding private realm and would cause clear visual harm and would therefore be contrary to policy 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Policy 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017 & The NPPF 2019."
