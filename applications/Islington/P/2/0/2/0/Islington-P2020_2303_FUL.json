    "REASON: Due to their prominent siting and appearance the proposed antennas, dishes and supporting structures would appear as dominant and discordant additions to the roof of the building within this location, and would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the setting of the adjoining St John's Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) contrary to the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017) & The NPPF 2019."
