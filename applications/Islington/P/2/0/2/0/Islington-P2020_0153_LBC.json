    "REASON: The proposed works by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form and unsympathetic design and prominent siting would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and fail to preserve the character and appearance of Barnsbury Conservation Area. The development would be visible from the private realm and strike a discordant feature when seen within the wider context of the host terrace. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, Islington's Urban Design Guidance and policies DM2.1 (Design) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
