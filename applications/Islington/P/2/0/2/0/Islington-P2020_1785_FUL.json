    "REASON: The proposed two storey dwelling by virtue of it's excessive and unacceptable design, prominent siting, scale, height and bulk would result in a loss of openness to the flank of the existing dwelling and would be a prominent and incongruous form of development readily visible from the surrounding public and private realm that would harm the character and appearance of the host property, symmetry of the pair of semi-detached villas and the wider Conservation Area, the application therefore fails to accord with the NPPF (2019), policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the Core Strategy (2011), policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
