    "Reason : 1 - The proposed works, by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic fabric, on setting and character and unsympathetic design, would adversely affect the character and special interest of the listed building and the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage assets, with no public benefit which outweighs this harm, contrary to Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011; Policies 2.1 & 2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guidance, and the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guide.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof terrace would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of\r\nadjacent residents through loss of privacy & unneighbourly overlooking. The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan Policy 7.6 and Policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013).\r"
