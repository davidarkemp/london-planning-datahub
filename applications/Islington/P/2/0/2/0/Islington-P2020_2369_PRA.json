    "INFORMATIVE (CRIME PREVENTION OFFICER MET POLICE): It is advised that all windows within three (3) metres of ground level (or those windows easily accessed from flat roof or other design feature) including roof windows on the proposed extension be security rated to one of the following:\r\n\r\n- PAS 24:2016\r\n- STS 204 Issue 6:2016\r\n- LPS 1175 Issue 7.2:2014 SR1\r\n- STS 202 Issue 7:2016 Burglary Rating 1\r\n- LPS 2081 Issue 1.1:2016 \r\n\r\nFor all door sets allowing direct access into the home the following standards are recommended:\r\n\r\n-\tPAS 24:2016\r\n-\tSTS 201 Issue 7:2015\r\n-\tLPS 1175 Issue 7.2:2014 SR 2 or above\r\n-\tLPS 1175 Issue 8:2018 Security Rating A3 of above\r\n-\tSTS 202 Issue 6:2015 Burglary Rating 2\r\n-\tLPS 2081 Issue 1.1:2016 Security Rating B\r\n\r\nIf the extension incorporates a flat roof it is recommended that the design provides no climbing opportunities. This includes square piping/fixtures recessed into the wall.\r\n\r\nWhere the existing windows of the property are subject to conservation consider the use of laminated glazing to add a layer of security. The installation of additional internal locks could also be considered by the owners (for the current owners to consider).\r\n\r\nIf yourself or the applicant wishes to discuss any of my recommendations further then please feel free to contact me. The advice I have provided have been taken from the following guides:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.securedbydesign.com/images/downloads/HOMES_BROCHURE_2019_update_May.pdf\r\n\r\nThe advice has been adjusted taking into consideration crime statistics and analysis of the area."
