    "REASON: The proposed works by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and the character and appearance of the conservation area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets with no public benefits which outweighs this harm contrary to Paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
