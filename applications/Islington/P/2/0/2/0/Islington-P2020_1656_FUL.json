    "REASON: The proposed erection of a clear glazed bulkhead above the existing roof level of the property by reason of its excessive height, bulk and form and overall unsympathetic size, bulk and design would dominate the roof form of the host property and appear visually intrusive from public and private views within the conservation area and within the setting of Grade II Listed Buildings within Sudeley Street. It would form a discordant feature at roof level that is out of character with the historic character of the host building and wider terrace setting and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and wider conservation area.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013). It also contravenes the guidance within the Urban Design Guide (2017), Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and the NPPF (2019)."
