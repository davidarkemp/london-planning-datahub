  "description": "FIVE DAY NOTICE\r\n\r\nRear garden\r\n\r\nRobinia - FELL (remove) and replant with suitable replacement tree, see below.\r\n\r\nN.B. Based on email, photos and submitted by Burnwell Trees, I am satisfied that the Robinia tree in the rear garden is dead and can therefore be removed without the express consent of this Council being required. Removal of the tree is consistent with Part 3, 14 & 15 (Exemptions) of the Town and Country Planning (Tree Preservation) (England) Regulations 2012, which provides for the removal of protected trees which are dead or dangerous.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is a legal duty to plant a replacement tree when a tree is removed under this exemption to the usual requirements of the legislation. In this instance, one replacement tree will be required, to be planted as close as practicable to the location of the original tree by the end of the first planting season following its removal (October 2020 - April 2021). The tree should be a standard sized nursery tree, container grown specimen with a minimum stem girth of 12-14cm at planting, the species and final location need to be agreed in writing prior to planting (and once the reason for the decline of the birch tree has been confirmed).\r\n\r\nTree planting will need to comply with the recommendations contained with BS8545 (2014) Trees: From Nursery to independence in the landscape. To help the establishment of new trees it is recommended that an irrigation tube or root bag is installed at the time of planting as this will help to direct the water to the roots located beneath.",
