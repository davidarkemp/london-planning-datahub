    "REASON: The proposed works for the rear extension at lower ground floor level, the projecting element at ground floor level and the replacement of the staircase by virtue of their scale, height, proportions, massing and detailed design will have a detrimental impact on the historic plan form and will result in loss of historic fabric. It would cause harm to the retained fabric and by its unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would, therefore cause ‘less than substantial’ harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington’s Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
