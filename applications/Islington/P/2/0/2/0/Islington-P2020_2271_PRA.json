    "Due to their siting, distrubution across the rooftop, appearance and visibility in short views from the surrounding public realm the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as visually alien and discordant additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location, cluttering the roof. This would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the building and streetscene and  the settings of the Barnsbury Conservation Area and the Grade listed properties No 214-246 Caledonian Road and No 11-63 Matilda Street. The proposals are therefore contrary policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
