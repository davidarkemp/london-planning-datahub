    "The proposed second floor extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale & location would disrupt the rhythm & appearance of the host property and the wider terrace. The proposal would form a discordant addition to the host property and wider terrace visible from the surrounding private realm and fails to preserve the character and appearance of the terrace and the wider Barnsbury Conservation Area. It would therefore be contrary with policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017 & The NPPF 2019."
