    "REASON: The proposed roof terrace, including balustrading and staircase connected to the dormer window would result in an inappropriate and uncharacteristic development, due to its detailed design, height and siting. It would create visual clutter above the two storey outrigger leading to an discordant form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the Stroud Green Conservation Area and the appearance of the building and wider terrace setting, contrary to policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, the guidance set out in the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Stroud Green Conservation Area Guidelines."
