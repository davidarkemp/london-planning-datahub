    "REASON: The proposed alteration of the design of the front lightwell from a splayed design covered by a metal grille to an open lightwell enclosed by railings would give rise to visual implications affecting the character and appearance of the application property, the application terrace and the Whitehall Park Conservation Area which would need to be fully assessed under either a S73 application or a  Full Planning Application.  Therefore, the proposed amendment would constitute a material amendment to the approved scheme and the non-material amendment proposed by this application is not agreed."
