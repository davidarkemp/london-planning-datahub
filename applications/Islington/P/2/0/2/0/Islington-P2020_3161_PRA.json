The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
