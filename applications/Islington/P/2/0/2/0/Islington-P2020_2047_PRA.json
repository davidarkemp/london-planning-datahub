    "Due to their siting and appearance and visibility in long and short views from the surrounding public realm the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as dominant and discordant additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location, cluttering the roof, and would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance and setting of the Hillmarton Conservation Area. The proposals are therefore contrary policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
