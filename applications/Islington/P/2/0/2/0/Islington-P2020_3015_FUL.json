The application is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy 4.4 of the London Plan 2016, Policy E4 of the Draft London Plan (Intend to Publish Version) December 2019, the objectives of Policy DM5.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013 and Policy SP3 of the Draft Islington Local Plan 2019 and as well as the Mayor of London's Supplementary Planning Guidance \"Land for Industry and Transport\"."
