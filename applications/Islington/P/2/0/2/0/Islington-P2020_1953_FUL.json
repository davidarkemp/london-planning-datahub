    "REASON: The proposed second floor extension by reason of its inappropriate design, prominent siting scale, massing, depth would form a discordant addition to the rear of the host property and wider terrace being readily visible from the surrounding private realm. The proposal would unacceptably harm and disrupt the rhythm & appearance of the host property and the wider terrace. The incongruous feature would also fail to preserve the character and appearance of the terrace and would therefore be contrary with policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
