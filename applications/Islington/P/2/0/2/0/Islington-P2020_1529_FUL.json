    "REASON: Due to their inappropriate and prominent siting, number, scale and appearance, the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as dominant, discordant and cluttered additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location with short and long viewpoints from the surrounding public and private realm to the visual detriment of the surrounding urban area. The proposal is considered to therefore cause clear visual harm to the character and appearance of the host building and wider setting of the adjacent Conservation Areas. The public benefit of the equipment is not considered to outweigh the harm caused to the heritage assets. For this reason, the proposal is contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2019) (NPPF) together with policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM2.7 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
