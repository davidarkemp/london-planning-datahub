    "REASON: The proposed mixed use redevelopment within the designated Finsbury Town Centre, would fail to incorporate the maximum amount of business floorspace reasonably possible on site. Furthermore, the proposed residential development fails to demonstrate that the maximum reasonable level of affordable housing has been provided, taking account of the borough-wide strategic target of 50% and the finacial viability of the proposal. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable and contrary to the Core Strategy (2011) policies CS12 and CS13, Development Management Policies (2013) DM5.1, DM9.2, the Development Viability SPD (2016) and Planning Obligations SPD (2014)."
