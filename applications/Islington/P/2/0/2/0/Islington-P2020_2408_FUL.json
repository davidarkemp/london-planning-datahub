    "REASON: The proposed works by virtue of the inappropriate design, prominent siting, scale, height, bulk and massing would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host terrace and wider urban setting. The development would strike a discordant feature and would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest/setting of neighbouring listed buildings and the character and appearance of the surrounding Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area.  The works would, cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage assets and there are no public benefits to outweigh this harm, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM 2.1, DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017 and The NPPF 2019."
