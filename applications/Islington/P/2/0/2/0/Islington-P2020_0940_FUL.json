    "The proposed second floor rear extension by reason of its height, scale, bulk, massing, positioning and form would fail to be subservient to the original building and would be a dominant and discordantl addition to the host building and wider terrace setting and would be harmful to the character of the host building  and local terrace. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the guidance within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the NPPF 2019."
