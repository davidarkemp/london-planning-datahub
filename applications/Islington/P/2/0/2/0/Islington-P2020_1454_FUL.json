    "REASON: The proposed rear dormer extension and outdoor terrace area by reason of their inappropriate design, scale, massing, bulk and prominent siting would form dominant and discordant additions to the host property and wider terrace setting. The addition would be readily visible from the surrounding public and private realm and would cause clear visual harm and would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policy 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017, Whitehall Park Conservation Guidance note & The NPPF 2019."
