    "REASON:  The proposed works for the extension of the existing outrigger by one storey and the extension of the lower ground floor into the existing rear lightwell, by virtue of their incongruous scale and unsympathetic design, would have a detrimental impact on the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and would adversely affect the character and appearance of the conservation area, and the proposed internal alterations including the subdivision of the rear second floor bedroom would result in an unacceptable loss of historic fabric and have a detrimental impact on the historic plan form of the building and so would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
