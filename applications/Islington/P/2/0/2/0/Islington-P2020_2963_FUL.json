    "REASON: The proposed lightwells and balustrade, due to their design, scale, prominence, location and materials used would harm the character and appearance of the building and the surrounding Tufnell Park Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage assets, with no public benefit which outweighs this harm, contrary to Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011; Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017, Islington's Basement Development SPD, and the Tufnell Park Conservation Area Design Guide."
