    "REASON: The proposed works, by reason of their detrimental impact on the character and spatial quality of the building and by reason of the excessive size and unsympathetic design of the extension would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building, the setting of the listed building and the character and appearance of the conservation area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets with no public benefits which outweighs this harm contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, [policy HC1 of the Intend to publish London plan], policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
