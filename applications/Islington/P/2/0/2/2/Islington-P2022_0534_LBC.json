    "REASON: The proposed works of the rear extension, and to the chimneybreasts at lower ground and first floor front rooms by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and Policy DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and guidance contained within the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area Guidelines (2002)."
