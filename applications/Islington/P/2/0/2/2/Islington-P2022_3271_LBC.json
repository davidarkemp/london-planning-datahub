The works would therefore cause less than substantial to the significance of the heritage asset without the public benefits to outweigh this harm, contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington’s Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington’s Urban Design Guide 2017."
