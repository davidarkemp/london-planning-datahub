    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, by reason of its inappropriate siting, bulk, massing height and detailed design together with the proposed front elevation cladding material and front entrance area alterations would introduce a dominant and discordant additions to the host building that would be clearly visible in short, medium and longer viewpoints from the surrounding public and private realm.  The proposed development would cause clear visual harm to the character and appearance of the host building, wider streetscene and conservation area, with no meaningful public benefit(s) to offset this harm, and are contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D3, D4 and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
