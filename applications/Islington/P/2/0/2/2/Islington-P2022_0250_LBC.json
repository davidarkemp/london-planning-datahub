    "REASON: The proposed installation of a hanging sign, by virtue of its detrimental impact on the harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 200 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM2.6 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), and guidance contained within the Islington Design Guide (2017) and The Angel Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
