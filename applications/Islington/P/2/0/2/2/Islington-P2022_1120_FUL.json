    "REASON: The proposed extension by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, siting massing and bulk would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host building and wider terrace setting. The development would harmfully disrupt the predominantly regular and rhythmic elevations and front, rear and side building lines of the host building and wider terrace area whilst also resulting in the loss of open garden areas and would cause visual harm when viewed from the surrounding public and private realms. The development is therefore contrary to policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), Islington's Urban Design Guidance & the NPPF 2021."
