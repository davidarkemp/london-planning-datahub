    "REASON: The proposed changes to the rear elevation and parapet height of House 5 would constitute additional development that would represent material alterations to the previously approved scheme. The alterations give rise to design and conservation and neighbouring amenity implications which would need to be fully assessed within a revised Section 73 or Full Planning application as appropriate. Therefore, the proposed amendment would constitute a material amendment to the approved scheme and the non-material amendment proposed within this application is therefore not agreed."
