    "The proposed amendment would not constitute a Non-Material Amendment. It is considered that the amendments which seek to increase the scale and mass of the proposed development are too significant to constitute a material amendment to the originally approved scheme, and therefore the changes would need to be assessed under a new Full Planning Application."
