    "REASON: The proposed rear infill extension and 2.5-strorey replacement closet wing and associated alterations to the rear elevation, by virtue of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic design, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause less than substantial to the significance of the heritage asset without public benefits to outweigh this harm contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, the guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and the Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
