    "REASON: The proposed mansard roof extension is not acceptable due to the visibility of the extension from public views, its disruption of the predominantly unbroken and established roofline, and the loss of the 'V' shaped rear roof parapet. The proposals would erode the architectural unity of the terrace which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to the requirements of the NPPF (2021) and fails to accord with policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
