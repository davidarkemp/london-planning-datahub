  "description": "Rear garden courtyard\r\n\r\nCherry - FELL (remove tree) and plant suitable replacement tree\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B. The proposed works are to remove this tree and replace with a suitable species of tree in the rear garden of the property. T1 has outgrown its location within a small courtyard garden that forms the outside amenity space for the media businesses which occupy 375-377 City Road. T1 dominates this small courtyard garden and its root growth is causing direct damage to the hardstanding. It has been subject to past management by crown reduction works but any pruning works and ongoing management within arboriculturally acceptable limits will not serve to prevent damage caused by the root system. The tree is to the rear of a three storey plus basement terrace of Georgian residential dwellings some of which are converted to provide office accommodation. When viewed from the rear Elia Mews and Service Road the views of this cherry are limited with a sycamore tree obscuring the views from the service road to the north-west.",
