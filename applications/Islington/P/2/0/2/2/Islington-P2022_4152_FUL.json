    "REASON: The proposed development due to the cumulative impact of the ridgeline increases as well as the combination of the dormer and outrigger roof extensions would lead to a discordant addition to the host building and the wider street scene. This is due to its inappropriate design, siting, size, form, bulk and massing which would be readily visible from the surrounding public and private realms causing clear visual harm to the character and appearance of the host building as well as the integrity of the terrace row. As such, the proposal is contrary to the NPPF (2021), London Plan (2021) Policy HC1, Core Strategy(2011) policy CS8 ,  Development Management(2013) Policy DM2.1 and the Urban Design guidelines(2017)"
