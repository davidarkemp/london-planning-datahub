    "The proposed rear extension over first floor by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, massing and height would form a dominant addition to the host building that would be harmful to the rear of the host property and wider settings of the Conservation Area and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and wider terrace row.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013. It also contravenes the guidance within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the NPPF 2021."
