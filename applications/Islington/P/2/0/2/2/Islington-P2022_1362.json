Both tree need to be reduced in height by one third and thinned out. Tree 1 see enclose satelite plane of tree to rear of the rear garden. Tree 2 see enclosed satelite plan of tree to rear of the rear garden. Tree 1 Sycamore has become so lardge at a castind shadows over all the neighbouring gardens, dropping a substantial amount of seed and causing damage to the adjacent boundary and graden walls. Tree 2 Ash is close to the rear of both 102 and 100 St Georges Avenue with a high risk of causing subsidence to these properties due to the London clay soil.
