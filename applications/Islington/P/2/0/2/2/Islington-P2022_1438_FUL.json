The works would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage assets without the public benefits to outweigh this harm, contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington’s Development Management Policies (2013) as well as the guidance of\r\nIslington’s Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington’s Urban \r\nDesign Guide (2017)."
