    "The proposed works, by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic planform, loss of historic fabric and unsympathetic materials, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the Grade II Listed Building. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, in conflict with the NPPF (2021), D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) as well as the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide and the Canonbury CADG (2002). The limited public benefits do not outweigh the less than substantial harm, in conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021)."
