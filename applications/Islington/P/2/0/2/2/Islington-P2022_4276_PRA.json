    "REASON: The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its inappropriate siting, height, scale, form and appearance would form an overly prominent, dominant and visually intrusive within the streetscape and would cause unacceptable harm to the visual amenities of the surrounding area, including the setting of the adjacent Newington Green Conservation Area. The proposal would not meet condition A.3 of Schedule 2, Part 16, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would contravene policies D4, HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM2.7 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance of Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017)."
