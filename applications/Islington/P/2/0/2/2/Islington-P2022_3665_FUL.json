    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate siting and detailed design, scale, form and massing would form a discordant and dominant addition that is readily visible from public and private realms including from Centurion Close and Wheelwright Street. Its overall positioning, size, form and visibility would create an awkward relationship that would disrupt the existing uniformity and legibility of roof form and rhythm of the terrace(s) along Centurion Close.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013 & Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
