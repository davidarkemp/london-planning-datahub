    "REASON: The proposed roof extensions by reason of their inappropriate siting, design, scale, bulk, height and massing would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host building and wider terrace setting. The proposal would harm to the character of the Whitehall Park conservation area and the existing dwellinghouse, containing no meaningful public benefits to outweigh the harm, which is deemed to be less than substantial. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Whitehall Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
