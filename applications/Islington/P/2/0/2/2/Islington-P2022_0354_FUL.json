    "REASON: The proposed roof extensions to the main dwelling by reason its inappropriate design, scale, siting, form and massing would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host property and wider terrace setting and would be readily visible from the surrounding public and private realms. The extensions would subsume the host property and detract/undermine from the characterful butterfly roof valley feature to the rear of the site. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017)."
