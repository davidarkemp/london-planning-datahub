    "REASON: The proposed works of the rear extension and some elements of the internal changes by virtue of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric, unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset without the public benefits to outweigh this harm, contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 of the NPPF (2021), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 and  DM2.3 of Islington’s Development Management Policies (2013) as well as the guidance contained within Islington’s Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington’s Urban Design Guide (2017)."
