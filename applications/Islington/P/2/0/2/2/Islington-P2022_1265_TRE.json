  "description": "Rear garden\r\n(TPO ref: T1 of TPO 8/1977 Barnsbury #5)\r\n\r\n(T1) Lime - Crown lift to 5m from ground level, reduce height to previous points of reduction, whilst retaining furnishing growth. Thin-out side growth by 50-60%, by removal of larger epicormic growth\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B. This tree was heavily reduced (pollarded) in 2017 due to serious decay found just above the point to which it was pruned at that time. A 5 day notice was issued by Islington at the time for this work. This proposed pruning is necessary to keep the tree within a reasonable managed condition going forward, and to negate the honey dew and associated fungal issues below the tree. Retention of furnishing growth is proposed to soften the impact of the pollard.",
