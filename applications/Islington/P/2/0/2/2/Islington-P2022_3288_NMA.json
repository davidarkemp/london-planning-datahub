    "REASON: The proposed removal of the rear window, reduction in the private amenity space for Flat 1, and relocation for refuse storage area,  would represent material alterations to the previously approved scheme. The alterations give rise to design and amenity implications which would need to be fully assessed within a revised Section 73 or Full Planning application as appropriate. Therefore, the proposed amendment would constitute a material amendment to the approved scheme and the non-material amendment proposed within this application is therefore not agreed."
