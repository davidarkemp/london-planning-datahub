    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate and prominent siting, design, scale, bulk, height and massing would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host building and wider terrace setting. The development would interrupt a predominantly unaltered and legible front and rear roofline within this section of the terrace to a harmful degree and would be harmfully visible from the surrounding public and private realm causing harm to the character and appearance of the Arlington Square Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Arlington Square Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
