Remove this branch back to branch collar. Also a branch growing into the adjacent property that was missed when the tree was recently reduced. This branch is growing into a Bay tree, causing it to become unbalanced. To improve the visual amenity of the Bay tree suggested works are; Remove the branch growing into the Bay tree back to a suitable growth point (approx. 2 metres).\r\n\r\nFront of property\r\n(TPO refs T8 + T10 of TPO 334/2007)\r\n\r\n(T2 of site sketch) Lime Tilia platyphyllos - This tree was pollarded many years ago. It has four stems growing from the trunk at approximately 4.5 metres. In, around and below all of these stems are multiple cavities. This decay at the crown break is so substantial that it poses a serious threat to the structural integrity of this tree. This in turn creates a very high risk of bio mechanical failure. Putting targets on the pavement below at risk and the structural integrity of this tree into doubt. To reduce the risk of bio mechanical failure by reducing loading on the weakened areas of this tree, suggested works are;\r\nPollard to approximately 9 metres. There are substantial cavities on two of the stems at this height so it is prudent to cut below these points. Photo evidence of cavities and photo with a red line indicating approx. finished pruned height of tree.\r\n\r\n(T4 of site sketch) Sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus - This tree has been pollarded three times at different heights. It has lost some major stems in the past, is unbalanced and has some substantial cavities at the crown break and the secondary pollard points. In one of the cavities at the crown break can be seen the fruiting body of a fungus, possibly Ganoderma australe. Shown in photo evidence. The cavities at the secondary pollard points increase the risk of structural",
