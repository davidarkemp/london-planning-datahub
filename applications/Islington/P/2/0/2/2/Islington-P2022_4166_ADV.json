    "REASON: The proposed fascia signs and projecting sign, by reason of their inappropriate size, design and method of illumination, would result in discordant and incongruous features that are harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and the wider Conservation Area. 1. No public benefits to outweigh this harm have been identified.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF 2021, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
