    "REASON: The proposed alteration to the party walls and the approved mansard extension is considered a material change from the previously approved permission. The height increase would have a visual impact upon the building and street scene and the altered mansard extension would be more than the similar terminating heights of its neighbours. Therefore the proposed changes are considered to be non-material and full planning is required for the proposals."
