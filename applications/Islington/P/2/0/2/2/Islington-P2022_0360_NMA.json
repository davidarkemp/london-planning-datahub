    "INFORMATIVE: The wording of Condition 17 (Lighting Plan) attached to planning permission P2020/3313/S73, dated 23/09/2021should now read as:\r\n\r\nLIGHTING PLAN: Full details of the lighting across the site shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the occupation of the relevant phase of the development hereby approved.\r\nThe details shall include the location and full specification of: all lamps; light levels/spill lamps, floodlights, support structures, hours of operation and technical details on how impacts on bat foraging will be minimised. The lighting measures shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved, shall be installed prior to occupation of the development and shall be maintained as such thereafter. \r\n\r\nREASON: To ensure that any resulting general or security lighting is appropriately located, designed do not adversely impact neighbouring residential amenity and are appropriate to the overall design of the buildings as well as protecting the biodiversity value of the site."
