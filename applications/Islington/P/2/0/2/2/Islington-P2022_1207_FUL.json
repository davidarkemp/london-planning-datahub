    "REASON: Due to its scale, bulk and massing the proposed roof extension would result in an incongruous addition at roof level which would be readily visible from street level. In addition the proposed two storey rear addition due to its depth, scale and poor overall design would add a discordant addition to the rear elevation which would fail to be subordinate to the host building. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve the visual appearance and historic character of the host building and result in less than substantial harm to the setting of the Barnsbury Conservation Area which is not outweighed by sufficient public benefits. The proposal is considered contrary to policies D1, D4 and HC1 of London Plan (2021) CS8 and CS9 of Islington Core Strategy (2011) and DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Development Management Policies (2013) and the advice found within Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and Barnsbury Conservation Area Guidelines."
