    "REASON: The proposed external MVHR unit and relocated ductwork across the approved green roof would constitute additional development that would represent material alterations to the previously approved scheme. The alterations give rise to sustainability implications which would need to be fully assessed within a revised Section 73 or Full Planning application as appropriate, and may impact the longevity of the approved green roof. Therefore, the proposed amendment would constitute a material amendment to the approved scheme and the non-material amendment proposed within this application is therefore not agreed."
