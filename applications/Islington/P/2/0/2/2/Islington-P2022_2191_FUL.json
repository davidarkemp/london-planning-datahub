    "REASON: The rear extension, by virtue of it's unsympathetic scale and design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the designated building. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the designated building, the wider terrace setting and the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 195 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies HC1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
