The tree has several bleeding cankers an indication of rot where the crown breaks where the large bowels begin into the canopy, I would say this would be pretty unsafe in my experience of looking at trees over the years, it has already had large breaks within the crown in the past and I donâ€™t think it would be safe to not reduce it quite heavily.",
