    "REASON: The proposed balustrade and planters by reason of their siting would create visual clutter at a prominent location compromising the visual and spatial qualities of Camden Passage and the character and appearance of The Angel Conservation Area. Furthermore, in relation to the listed buildings at nos. 1 and 2 Camden Walk, the balustrade would result in lless than substantial harm to its overall setrting with an absence of any public benefit. As such, the proposal has failed to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of The Angel conservation area or the special and architectural historic interests of the listed buildings contrary to paragraph 202 of the NPPF(2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), policies DM 2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013); and guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
