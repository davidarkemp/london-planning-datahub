    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its excessive depth and projection at first floor beyond the established building line of the adjacent neighbouring properties would result in a dominant and discordant addition which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling house. Its presence would disrupt rhythm and the consistent and orderly pattern of extensions present at the rear of the terrace in which it sits and would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the terrace. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017)."
