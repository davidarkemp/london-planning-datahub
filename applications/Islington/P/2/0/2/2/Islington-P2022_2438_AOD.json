    "REASON: The proposed height, width, depth and scale of the cycle storage container and its siting within the front courtyard area of the property would result in a highly visible and unappealing addition to the host building and is considered wholly unacceptable in design and visual terms. The structure require planning permission in its own right and would form dominant and discordant visual addition to the streetscape and would be readily visible form the surrounding public realm to the clear detriment of the character streetscene. In addition, there is insufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed bin store is acceptable and whether the required number of bins could be provided. The development would not therefore ensure a satisfactory standard of provision of cycle parking and refuse storage contrary to policies CS8 & CS11 of the Core Strategy and policies DM2.1. & DM8.4 of the Development Management Policies and Islington's Urban Design Guidance."
