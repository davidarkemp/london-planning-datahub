    "REASON: The proposed ridgeline increases and rear dormer and three front rooflights would be situated within a terrace row that has a predominantly unaltered roofline. By reason of their inappropriate design, siting, size, form, bulk and massing would form a dominant and discordant additions within the host terrace and would be readily visible from the surrounding public and private realms causing clear visual harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, the integrity of the terrace row and the Hillmarton Conservation Area. As such, the proposal has failed to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of Hillmarton Conservation Area and is contrary to the NPPF (2021), London Plan (2021) Policy HC1, Core Strategy(2011) policies CS8 and CS9,  Development Management(2013) Policies DM2.1 and 2.3, the Urban Design guidelines(2017) and the Hillmarton Conservation Area guidelines(2002)."
