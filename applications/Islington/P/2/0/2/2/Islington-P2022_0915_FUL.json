    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, by reason of its inappropriate scale, siting, massing, bulk, form and detailed design, would form a discordant and dominant addition that would harm the character and appearance of the host building and the wider terrace setting which maintains an unaltered roof form. The proposal would therefore fail preserve the character and appearance of the Tufnell Park Conservation Area and contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Tufnell Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
