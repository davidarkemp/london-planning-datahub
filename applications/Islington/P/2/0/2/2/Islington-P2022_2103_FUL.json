    "REASON: The proposed side and rear extension by reason of its unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the designated building and as such would fail to preserve the character of the Canonbury Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage assets without the public benefits to outweigh this harm, contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 of the NPPF (2021), policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 and  DM2.3 of Islington’s Development Management Policies (2013) as well as the guidance contained within Islington’s Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington’s Urban Design Guide (2017)."
