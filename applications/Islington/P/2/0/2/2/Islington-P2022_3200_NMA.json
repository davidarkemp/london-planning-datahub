    "REASON: The proposed increased height to the rear mansard, alterations to the approved dormer windows, changes to the materiality of the front entrance gate and change in material to the fire escape door at the ground floor level side elevation would constitute additional development that would represent material alterations to the previously approved scheme. The alterations give rise to design and amenity implications which would need to be fully assessed within a revised Section 73 or Full Planning application as appropriate. Therefore, the proposed amendment would constitute a material amendment to the approved scheme and the non-material amendment proposed within this application is therefore not agreed."
