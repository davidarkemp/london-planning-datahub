    "REASON: The proposed roof extension (including front rooflights), by virtue of its inappropriate design, scale, height, siting, form, massing and bulk is considered to form a dominant and discordant and harmful visual addition to the dwelling when seen from both the public and private realms. The proposal would undermine the existing uniform and rhythmic unaltered rear roof forms and would not respond positively to the character of the surrounding area. The proposal would fail to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the Whitehall Park Conservation Area. It is considered to be contrary to policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management policies 2013, the Whitehall Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
