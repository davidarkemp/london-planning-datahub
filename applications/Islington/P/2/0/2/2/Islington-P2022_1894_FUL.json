    "REASON: The proposed full-width lower ground and half-width ground floor extensions by reason of their inappropriate design, scale, siting, bulk, massing, form and rearward depth, would form a dominant and discordant feature to the building and would harm the overall appearance of the existing terrace building and wider terrace setting whilst clearly failing to preserve the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
