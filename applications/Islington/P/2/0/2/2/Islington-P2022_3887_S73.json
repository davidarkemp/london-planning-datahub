    "REASON: The proposed ground floor site layout, by reason of the prominent siting of the refuse storage structure and siting private outdoor amenity space to the front of the property, is considered to create an incongruous feature in the streetscene that would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host property and the wider terrace and would be detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers of the ground floor flat. The application therefore fails to accord with the chapters 2 and 12 of the NPPF (2021), policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), Draft Local Plan Policy PLAN1, Policy H4 and Policy H5 and the guidance contained within the Councils Urban Design Guide (2017)."
