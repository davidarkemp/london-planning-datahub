    "REASON: The proposed rear extension and plant enclosure at lower ground floor level by virtue of their excessive depth, scale, massing, bulk and unsympathetic design would form dominant discordant additions to the rear of the property whilst adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and the character and appearance of the wider Conservation Area.  In addition, the proposed internal alterations by virtue of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, removal and harmful impacts to historic fabric, and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause less than substantial to the significance of the heritage asset without the public benefits to outweigh this harm, contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
