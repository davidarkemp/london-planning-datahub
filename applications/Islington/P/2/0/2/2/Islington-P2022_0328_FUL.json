    "REASON: The proposed rear dormer roof extension, along with an additional extension to the rear side angle of the roof, by reason of their inappropriate and prominent siting, scale, massing, bulk and detailed design would form a dominant and discordant addition that would be harmful to the character of the host dwelling house and wider terrace setting being readily visible from the surrounding public and private realm, which would harm the appearance of the building and wider setting of the Whistler Street Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017).The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9  of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017)."
