    "REASON: The proposed works by their lack of consideration to historic context, unsympathetic design, inappropriate materials inadequate information and lack of heritage justification would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and the character and appearance of the conservation area. The works would, therefore cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage assets, with no public benefits which outweighs this harm contrary to paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021,  policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017)."
