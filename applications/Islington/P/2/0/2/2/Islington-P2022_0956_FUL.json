    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, height form, bulk and prominent siting would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host property and wider terrace setting. The proposal would disrupt the rhythm, uniformity and integrity of the terrace to the detriment of the wider Duncan Terrace/Colebrook Row Conservation Area by reason that it would interrupt an unbroken roofline, would be visible from public and private viewpoints and would result in the loss of the traditional V roof profile. The proposed mansard roof extension is therefore considered to fail to comply with the NPPF (2021), policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011); policies DM2.1 and Policy DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance of the Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
