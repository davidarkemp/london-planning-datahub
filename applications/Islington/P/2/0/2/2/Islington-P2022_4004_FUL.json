    "REASON: The proposed rear extension and plant enclosure at rear lower ground floor level by virtue of their excessive depth, scale, massing, bulk and unsympathetic design would form dominant discordant additions to the rear of the property whilst adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and the character and appearance of the wider Conservation Area. As such, the proposals would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's Character) and CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 (Design) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
