    "REASON: The proposed works, by reason of their design and unsympathetic materials, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the designated building and   the visual amenities of the surrounding Canonbury Conservation Area. The works would neither preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area and conflict with the NPPF (2021), D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) as well as the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide and the Canonbury CADG (2002). The limited public benefits do not outweigh the less than substantial harm, in conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021)."
