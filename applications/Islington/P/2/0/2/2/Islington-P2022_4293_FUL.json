    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, siting, scale, form and height would form a dominant and discordant feature which would be visible from both the public and private realms. It would result in unsympathetic and visually incongruous additions and roof levels of the host building, terrace setting and would neither preserve nor enhance the host building, wider terrace setting or the Whitehall Park Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies, Islington's Urban Design Guide, Conservation Area Design Guidelines & The NPPF 2019."
