    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, visibility and height, would result in an incongruous and discordant addition to the building and the consistent roofline within this stretch of terraced buildings. The proposed development would erode the existing rhythm of the roofs on the terrace along this side of Mildmay Road and would be seen as a harmful feature when observed from front and rear public views. The proposed extension would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and wider conservation area. The development is therefore be contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011); policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), the Newington Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2014) and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines (2017)."
