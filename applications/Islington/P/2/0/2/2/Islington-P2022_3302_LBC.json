    "REASON: The proposed works of excavation and the creation of steps and handrails in the lobby and north vault and the proposed installation of a chiller unit with external canopy, by virtue of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
