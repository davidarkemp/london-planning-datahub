    "REASON: The proposal fails to comply with condtions A.4(8) and A.4(9) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended.  The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their excessive depth, height and proximity to other residential properties and in the absence of the 45 degree and 25 degree tests or a daylight/sunlight assessment, would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of adjacent residential buildings and gardens through loss of daylight/sunlight, overbearing, sense of enclosure and harm to outlook.  As such, prior approval is required and refused."
