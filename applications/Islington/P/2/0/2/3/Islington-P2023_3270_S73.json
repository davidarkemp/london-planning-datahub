    "REASON: The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive scale, depth, bulk, massing and detailed design, is considered to be overly dominant and discordant with the host building and terrace of which it forms part, when viewed from the private realm. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy PLAN1 of Islington's Strategic and Development Management Policies 2023 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
