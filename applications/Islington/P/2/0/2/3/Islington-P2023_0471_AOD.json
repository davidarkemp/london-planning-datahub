    "The applicant is advised of the following:\r\n\r\nThe site is bound by the A501, Pentonville Road which forms part of the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN) and the A5203, York Way which forms part of the Strategic Road Network. TfL is the highway authority for the TLRN, and is therefore concerned about any proposal which may affect the performance and/or safety of the TLRN. TfL also has a duty under the Traffic Management Act 2004 to ensure that any development does not have an adverse impact on the SRN.\r\n\r\nThe footway and carriageway on the A501, Pentonville Road; A5203, York Way and A5203, Wharfdale Road must not be blocked during the construction of the development. Temporary obstructions during the construction must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic on the roads mentioned.\r\n\r\nAll vehicles associated with the construction of the development must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.\r\n\r\nNo skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time. Should the applicant wish to install scaffolding or a hoarding on the footway whilst undertaking this work, separate licences may be required with TfL, please see, https://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/urban-planning-and-construction/highway-licences \r\n\r\nTfL welcome the use of dedicated traffic marshalls.\r\n\r\nAny hoarding for the proposed development would be subject to a separate Section 172 licence application under the Highways Act 1980 to the Asset Operations team at TfL. \r\n\r\nAny scaffolding for the proposed development would be subject to a separate Section 169 licence application under the Highways Act 1980 to the Asset Operations Team at TfL."
