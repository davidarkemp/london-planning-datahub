    "Based on the information presented with this proposed certificate of lawful development it is considered that the proposed change of use with re-installation of bathrooms to bedrooms 3,4 and 5 would not be lawful under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class L of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) because it would directly conflict with the requirements of enforcement notice 38-2018 (as amended by virtue of S173A of the TCPA) and its attached letter dated 11 December 2019.  As such, full planning permission would be required; and this lawful development certificate is REFUSED."
