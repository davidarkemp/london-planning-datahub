    "REASON: The proposed works, and most particularly the proposed rear extension, by virtue of its unsympathetic design, detrimental impact on the characteristic 'flat back' rear elevation, and overall quantum of development, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the host listed building along with character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies PLAN1, DH1cand DH2 of the SDMP 2023, as well as guidance contained within the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
