    "REASON: The proposed telecommunications mast and associated equipment would by reason of its inappropriate height, siting, form and appearance would represent an overly prominent and visually harmful addition that would detract from local spatial character and result in undue harm to the Copenhagen Junction Site of Importance for Nature Conservation. The development is therefore contrary to the objectives of policies D4, G6 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS15 of the Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1, DM2.7 and DM6.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance within Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017)."
