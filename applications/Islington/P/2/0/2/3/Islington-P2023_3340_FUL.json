    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, by reason of its scale, height, depth, massing and bulk would form a dominant and discordant addition to host building and wider terrace. The development would disrupt the predominantly unbroken roofline and would be visible in long views, private view and views from Gibson Square to the north. The incongruous development would cause harm to the listed building and to the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area and there are no public benefits to outweigh the harm caused. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets contrary to the NPPF 2023, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies PLAN1, DH1 and DH2 of the SDMP 2023, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
