  "subdivision_of_building": "The proposal for the replacement of two wooden sash windows only affects the Second Floor, which is part of the Upper Maisonette, 11 and a half Highbury Place, N5 1QZ, for which the applicant is a long leaseholder. The two other flats in the building (11 and a half Highbury Place) are rented out by the freeholder. The freeholder of the building was sent a letter by the applicant, dated 28 April 2023, asking whether the freeholder would consent to replacement like-for-like wooden sash windows with double glazing, and also whether he would support an application for planning permission to that end. The freeholder wrote a letter dated 9 May 2023 indicating his support (see 'Freeholder consent_ 9 May 2023.pdf' in supporting documents). A pre-application enquiry was emailed by the applicant to the Development Management Service (Planning and Development), Islington Council on 3 June 2023, with the detailed response received on 31 August 2023 (Reference: Q2023/1583/HH). On 27 September 2023 the applicant emailed and posted to the freeholder a Notice under Article 13 of Application for Planning Permission, under the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (see 'Article 13 Notice.pdf' in supporting documents).",
