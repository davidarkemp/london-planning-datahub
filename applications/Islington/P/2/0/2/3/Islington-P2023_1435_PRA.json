    "REASON: The proposed telecommunications monopole and associated cabinets and equipment would, by reason of their inappropriate siting, height, scale, form and appearance, form an overly prominent, dominant and visually intrusive presence within this local public realm space and streetscape causing unacceptable harm to its existing spatial character and appearance and harm to the character and appearance of the Tufnell Park Conservation Area. The proposal therefore  fails to comply with policies D3, D4, D8, HC1 and SI6 of the London Plan (2021); Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM2.7  of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and guidance within Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017). The proposed works therefore do not accord with Schedule 2, Part 16, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
