    "REASON: The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive siting, design, form, bulk, and rearward depth would form a dominant and disproportionate addition to the host property, wider terrace and surrounding Conservation Area. The addition would be visible form the surrounding public and private realms causing harm to the host property and wider terrace setting including the Barnsbury Conservation Area, in conflict with the NPPF (2021), Policies PLAN1, DH1 and DH2 of the Islington SDMP (2023) and the guidance contained within the Islington UDG (2017) and the Barnsbury CADG (2002)."
