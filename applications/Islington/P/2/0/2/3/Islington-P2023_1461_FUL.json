    "Reason: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, prominent siting, scale, visibility, massing, bulk and height would result in a dominant and discordant addition to the host building, wider terrace setting whilst disrupting the unaltered and the consistent front and rear roofline within this stretch of terraced buildings. The proposed development would erode the existing rhythm of the roofs on the terrace along this Penderyn Way and would be seen as a harmful feature when observed from both the public and private realms.  The proposed development is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS8 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017) & Islington Local Plan Policy PLAN 1 2023."
