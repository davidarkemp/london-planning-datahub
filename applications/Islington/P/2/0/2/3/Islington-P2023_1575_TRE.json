  "description": "Rear of 90 Highgate Hill (located at top of retaining wall)\r\n\r\n(T1-T3) Common Lime x3 - Re-pollard back to previous pollard points @ approx 6m height. Works to re-establish maintenance regime to ensure longevity for location.\r\n\r\n(T7) Sycamore - Fell (remove tree)\r\n\r\nNB. Work required due to position/location of tree (T7) in proximity to the existing retaining wall. The stem of this tree 'dog legs' over the wall and the base of the stem is situation directly behind the top of the wall and is in contact. Works to prevent future structural issues. Based on these facts the tree has limited future potential and I believe would not achieve a sufficient TEMPO score to warrant the formation of a TPO.",
