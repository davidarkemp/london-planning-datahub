  "description": "The trees are on the perimeter of Thornhill Square Garden. This application is being requested because the original Victorian cast iron railings run close by some large, probably original, trees e.g. London Planes. An arboriculturist is to be consulted so that a programme of repairs to any of the railings near to these trees can be prepared, so that no damage is caused to the trees. A plan of the relevant trees together with details of any TPOs and the agreed works will be submitted once it has been prepared.",
