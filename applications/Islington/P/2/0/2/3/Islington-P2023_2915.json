  "description": "1. Removal of dead laburnum within yew hedge. 2. Lowering of Stag's Horn Sumac to approx 4.3m, being 2.6m above the crown, which is at 1.7m. The tree is close to the house and blocking windows. 2. Removal of Stag's Horn Sumac which seems to be adversely effecting an old apple tree next to it, and which is overhanging the Crafts Council at 44A Pentonville Road. 4. Removal of a self-seeded sycamore sapling, measuring 25cms diameter at a height of 1.5 metres from the ground. 5. Lowering of 5 Stag's Horn Sumacs to 3.5 metres. These trees overhang the road and the Crafts Council have complained that they are intefering with wayfinding. 6. Lowering of cooking apple tree to 3 metres, much of which is dead wood. The tree divides at 1.4 and 1.7 metres. In mitigation of this loss, we have already planted approximately 30 meters of yew hedge along the South and East boundary, which is now 2.1 metres high. I have planted 10 small trees at the back of the property. I propose planting one or two fruit trees at the front of the house.",
