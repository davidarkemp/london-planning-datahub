    "The proposed works, and most particularly the vertical extension to the existing outrigger, by virtue of their loss of historic fabric and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policy DH2: Heritage Assets of Islington Local Plan Strategic and Development Management Policies September 2019, and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington’s Urban Design Guide 2017."
