    "The proposed roof extension, by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, visibility and height, would result in an incongruous and discordant addition to the building and the largely unaltered roofline within this stretch of terraced buildings. The proposed development would erode the existing rhythm of the roofs on the terrace along this side of Rheidol Terrace and would be seen as a harmful feature when observed from front public views. The proposed extension would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and wider conservation area. The development is therefore be contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy PLAN1, Part A of Policy DH1, Policy DH2 of Islington's SDMP 2023, the Duncan Terrace/ Colebrooke Row Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines (2017)."
