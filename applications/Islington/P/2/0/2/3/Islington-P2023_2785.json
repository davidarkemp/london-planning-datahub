  "description": "We are seeking permission to undertake a crown reduction on a horse chestnut tree located at the end of the garden of 1 Aubert Park, London N5 1TL. The tree overhangs the garden of 43 Jack Walker Court, London N5 1SG and we would like to cut the tree back to the boundary line of the property. The three included images show the location of the tree, which is identified in each with a red circle. As far as we are aware, the tree is not subject to a TPO. There is a young child living at 43 Jack Walker Court who regularly uses the garden. It's dangerous for him to be out there when the horse chestnuts are dropping from the trees, as it would cause an injury to him should one land on him. The tree is not clearly visible from Aubert Park or Highbury Park and therefore is only visible from Jack Walker Court.",
