Reduce low epicormic growth, (growing to an approximate height of 6.00-8.00m) by approximately 2.00m by pruning back to the main stem where appropriate and to suitable growth points where branch structure is to be retained. In addition, reduce one low branch, approximately 12cm diameter and approximately 2.00m from ground level which overhangs the rear boundary back to the main stem.",
