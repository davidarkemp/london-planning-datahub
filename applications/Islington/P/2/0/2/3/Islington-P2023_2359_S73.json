    "REFUSAL: The proposed increase in height of the front boundary fence, by virtual of the visual prominence from street level and its scale, is considered to be discordant with the host building and street scene.  The proposal would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host building, street scene and Newington Green Conservation Area, which is not outweighed by sufficient public benefits, contrary to policies D4 and HC1 of London Plan (2021), policies PLAN1, DH1 and DH2 of the Strategic and Development Management Policies Document (2023) and the design advice within the Islington Urban Design Guide and Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
