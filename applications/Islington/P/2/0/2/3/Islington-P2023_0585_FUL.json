    "REASON: The proposal by reason of its unsympathetic design, form, siting, massing and materials at rear first floor level would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the designated building, semi -detached villa pair being visible form the public and private realms whilst failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Canonbury Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, in conflict with the NPPF (2021), Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) as well as the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Canonbury CADG (2002). It is considered that there is clear insufficient public benefit to outweigh the less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset."
