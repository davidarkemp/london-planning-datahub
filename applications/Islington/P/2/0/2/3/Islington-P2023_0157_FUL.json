    "The proposed alterations to the existing roof extension by reason of its glazed infill element would introduce a non-traditional feature to the roofline that would harm the  architectural merits of this heritage asset with deleterious impacts to the character and appearance of the property, terrace row and wider Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area. As such, the proposal has failed to pay special regard to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the listed building, its setting and any of its features of special architectural or historic interest; contrary to sections 16(2), 66(1) and 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan(2021), policies CS8 and CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2 (amenity) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies (2013); guidance contained Islington’s Urban Design Guide (2017) and the conservation area guidelines."
