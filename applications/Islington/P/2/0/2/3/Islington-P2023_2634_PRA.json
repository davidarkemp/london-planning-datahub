    "REASON: The proposal fails to comply with condtions A.4(8) and A.4(9) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended.  The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height, massing and siting would be a dominant and overbearing addition that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and would cause harm to the outlook to the rear ground floor windows of the neighbouring occupants at No. 29 Marlborough Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy PLAN1 of the Islington Strategic and Development Management Policies (SDMP) (2023).  Prior approval is required and refused."
