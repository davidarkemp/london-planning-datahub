    "REASON: The proposed works including the replacement conservatory and roof level enclosure extension, by virtue of their unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the designated building and as such would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DH1 and DH2 of the Islington SDMP (2023) as well as the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row CADG (2002). It is not considered that there is sufficient public benefit to outweigh the less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset."
