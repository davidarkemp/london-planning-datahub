    "REASON:The proposed works, and most particularly the starkly contrasting interventions comprising the replacement conservatory extension, internal stair at second floor and roof level enclosure extension, by virtue of their unsympathetic design, detrimental impact on the historic plan form and the group value/setting of adjacent listed terrace buildings, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the host listed building and nearby assets. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DH1 and DH2 of the Islington SDMP (2023) as well as the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row CADG (2002). It is not considered that there is sufficient public benefit to outweigh the less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset."
