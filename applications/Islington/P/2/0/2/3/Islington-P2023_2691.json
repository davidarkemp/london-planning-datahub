  "description": "Removal / Variation of Condition (2) of Planning Permission Ref. P2021/3713/FUL \ndated 28/03/2022\nProposed new location for ASHP at end of garden - adhering with Condition 5 and Informative 1 of P2021/3713/FUL, i.e. 1 metre away from the boundary and not exceeding a rating level of 42dBA at 1m from the facade of the nearest noise sensitive premises. The ASHP unit requires an open, unobstructed area in front of it to function properly. Louvered doors covering the unit would restrict the necessary airflow. The new proposed location is more discreet and concealed from view from all angles while allowing the ASHP to operate effectively.\n\nErection of single storey rear extension (with air source heat pump in rear enclosure); replacement of single glazed timber framed windows with double glazed slimline windows; installation of solar slates to front and rear roofslopes; replacement of 2 no. rooflights to the front rooslope; installation of 3 no. rooflights to rear roofslope",
