    "REASON: The proposed side extension within the lightwell by reason of its detrimental impact on the historic plan form and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset which is not outweighed by sufficient public benefit and is contrary to paragraph 202 of Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
