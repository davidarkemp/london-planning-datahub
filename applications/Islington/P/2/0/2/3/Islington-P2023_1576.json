  "description": "Scope: Reduce mature Ailanthus altissima by up to 1m, retaining the growth structure. With the intention of doing similar work every 2 years, to reduce the overall size of the canopy gradually. T1 is a mature Ailanthus altissima located in the rear garden of the parent house, the trees canopy currently covers a large proportion of the garden, which is used by clients and their children. Our client has requested we pollard the tree hard to reduce the canopy size drastically, I've explained to the client that due to the species of tree it would respond very negatively to this. My recommendation is that over the course of several years we incrementally reduce T1 until its a more suitable size, the first phase of work would be a reduction up to and not exceeding 1m.",
