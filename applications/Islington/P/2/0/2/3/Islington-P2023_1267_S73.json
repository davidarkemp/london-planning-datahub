    "The proposed variation of condition 7 would result in the loss of business floorspace that would fail to comply with Policy DM5.2 of the Development Management Policies Document (2013) and policy BC 8 of the Finsbury Local Plan (2013) and the marketing evidence provided is not considered to overcome the harm identified to the Central Activities Zone and Employment Priority Area by the loss of approximately 300sq.m of office space. The proposal also fails to comply with Islington's Emerging Local Plan (2013) Policy B3."
