  "description": "Replacement of the doors of 6 and 6a Swan Yard N1 1SD in 2015 in the mistaken view the I did not need planning consent. I believed it came in the category of a dwelling house and had also been advised in a building survey from 2008 that the building was not listed or in a conservation area, and did not come up in either category in our solicitor's searches at the time either. The issue has come to light by the sale of the lease of 6a Swan Yard in the buyers solicitors searches. I now wish to correct the lack of planning consent.\nThe UPVC door to 6a which was replaced was modern and inappropriate for an old warehouse, installed by a leaseholder in 2013/2014 without the freeholders knowledge or planning consent.\nThe door to 6 Swan Yard was modern and maybe dated from 2001 when the building was converted from a warehouse/taxi office to a domestic dwelling, undertaken by previous owners. I have owned the freehold since 2010.\nThe door design, undertaken by a reputable conservation design standard company, was based on the door of 4 Swan Yard as it was more suited for a building that had been a warehouse.",
