    "WINDOWS OBSCURED AND FIXED SHUT AS SHOWN ON PLANS (COMPLIANCE):  Notwithstanding the hereby approved plans, the proposed first floor side windows serving the outrigger shown on drawing P09/005 Rev A  (with annotation O/S) hereby approved as being obscurely glazed shall be provided as such prior to the first occupation of the development.\r\n\r\nAll obscurely glazed windows shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable, unless revised plans are submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nThe development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved and maintained as such thereafter into perpetuity. \r\n\r\nREASON: To prevent the undue overlooking of neighbouring habitable room windows."
