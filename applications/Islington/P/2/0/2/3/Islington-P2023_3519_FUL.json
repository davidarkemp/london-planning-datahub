    "REASON: The proposed garden building, by virtue of its inappropriate design, siting, footprint and detrimental impact on the character of the host building and potential terracing affect, would adversely impact the character and special architectural and historic interest of the host listed building along with character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets, with no public benefit to outweight this harm.  The proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies PLAN1, DH1 and DH2 of the SDMP 2023, as well as guidance contained within the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
