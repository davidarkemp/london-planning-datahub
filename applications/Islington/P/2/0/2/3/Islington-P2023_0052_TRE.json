  "description": "A hardwood tree at the rear of my garden needs trimming. It look not healthy & has several snapped branches, none of which are a danger to humans & others weighing onto my garden office roof, I just bought the flat and my surveyor mentioned the idea the branches as thr ceiling is bending down. People living in the house mentioned they're unsure whom the tree belongs to. It sits on land to the rear of their property inbetween 2 fences it's the house adjacant to mine on the right hand side,. There is a large softwood tree of the rear end of the adjacent property to mine people living there think it's not their tree large branches over hanging onto my property and my garden office roof. It's a tricky one as a tree on my property is totally entangled with this softwood tree, both weighing onto my garden office roof this explained in the other form for my tree I just bought the flat and my surveyor advised to clear the roof and trim branches .",
