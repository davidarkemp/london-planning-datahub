    "REASON: The proposal, by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic staircase, loss of historic fabric, bulk, massing and siting at rear first floor level would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the Grade II Listed Building and semi-detached villa pair. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, in conflict with the NPPF (2021), Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and Policies PLAN1, DH1 and DH2 of Islington's Strategic and Development Management Policies (2019) as well as the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Canonbury CADG (2002). It is not considered that there is sufficient public benefit to outweigh the less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset."
