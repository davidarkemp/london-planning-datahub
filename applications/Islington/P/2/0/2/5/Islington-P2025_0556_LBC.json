  "description": "The proposal seeks to undertake internal alterations to the existing ground floor flat to improve its functionality and layout. The key elements of the proposal include:\r\nReconfiguration of the kitchen and bedroom layout: The existing kitchen will be repurposed as a second bedroom. This will involve the removal of the adjacent wall to the existing bathing area to provide additional space for the new bedroom.\r\nCreation of an open-plan living space: The kitchen will be relocated to the existing lounge area, forming an open-plan kitchen/living arrangement, enhancing the usability and spatial efficiency of the flat.\r\nIntroduction of additional storage: A new storage room will be incorporated within the existing central corridor to optimize internal space usage. Enhanced bathroom facilities: The existing toilet will be extended to create a shower room with WC, and a new door connection will be introduced between the existing first bedroom and lounge area to improve internal circulation.\r\nNo external alterations to the property are proposed as part of this application. There will be no change of use.\r\nWritten advice with site visit\t£1,200     £240\t£1,440",
