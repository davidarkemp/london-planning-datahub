  "description": "My roof (London butterfly type) needs replacing and I would like to do this with a view to getting solar panels on them (they face east and west so would be great for this).  None of the sloping roof is visible from the front street due to the brick parapet wall across the front (the situation is the same at the back). The next-door Council property (28) has a replacement roof of modern manmade tiles. \r\nMy surveyor noted that the roof consists of Eternit manmade slate, not original or natural slate (probably from the 1990s). I would like to replace these with tiles most appropriate for supporting solar panels, which would not necessarily be slate-like (it could be clay or concrete tiles â€“ this is what my supplier, Octopus, recommends).  \r\nAs this is on the edge of the CA, I cannot install solar panels as permitted development.  However, they could not be seen from the road.\r\nI very much hope I could get a Certificate of Lawfulness or some way of doing this work that would be invisible without going through the permission process, for speed and cost.  \r\nI am really keen to maximise my ability to contribute to lowering my carbon footprint, so hope you can endorse this (and as quickly and cheaply as possible).",
