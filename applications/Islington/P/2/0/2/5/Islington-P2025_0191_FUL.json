    "REASON: The proposed roof terrace with associated railings and planting would by reason of it's siting and scale be a discordant and uncharacteristic feature that would fail to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the host dwelinghouse and Calabria Road Conservation Area. The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF 2024, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies PLAN1, DH1 and DH2 of the Strategic and Development Management Policies (2023) and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
