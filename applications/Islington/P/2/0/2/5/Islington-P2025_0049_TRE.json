  "description": "We have two trees in our back garden, and we wish to remove the tree on the right as it has grown exponentially and having both trees in place significantly blocks the sunlight to the garden. Not only is this undesirable in the summer months when we spend a lot of time outdoors, but it means our ability to maintain various species of flowers is severely impacted due to the lack of light getting through. Having both trees brings a lot of insects to the garden and we have a toddler and will soon have a new baby and we want to minimise the impact of the bugs and insects while they play outside. We are proposing to keep the left hand tree and remove the right hand tree.",
