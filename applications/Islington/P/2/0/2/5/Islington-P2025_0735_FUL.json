The council considers the definition of 'superstructure' as having its normal or dictionary meaning, which is: the part of a building above its foundations.  The council considers the definition of 'practical completion' to be: when the work reaches a state of readiness for use or occupation even though there may be outstanding works/matters to be carried out."
