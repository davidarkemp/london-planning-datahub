  "description": "This is a Listed Building Consent Pre-Application for approval to install new internal and external stairs at 13a Percy Circus, an upper ground floor family dwelling located within Percy Circus. The property is Grade II listed. The proposed new staircases are being proposed to provide access to the large private garden at the rear from the upper-level family accommodation.\r\nDue to the listed status of the property, we are proposing to retain the existing internal stair. A limited section of the handrail from entry level to half-landing level will be replaced to construct the new stair above the existing and to ensure the stair is safe to use.\r\nThe external stair accessing the garden will be constructed from black metal to mimic the design and layout of neighboring rear garden access stairs.",
