  "description": "T1. Lime tree. The tree is a large lime tree taht has not been reduced in roughly 5 years, it has a large cavity at the base and many weak points in its limbs due to twisted branches. The tree is touching both property roofs and at the moment may be causing damage to the neighbours roof as loud creaking noise can be heard from the floor. We would like to reduce the tree by 2/3 meters beyond the previous points of reduction to relieve weight from the limbs, Prune with 2 meter clearence from properties, thin by 20% to reduce the sail of the canopy. \r\nT2.Lime tree, this tree also has a very large Cavity, We would like to reduce the tree by 2/3 meters beyond the previous points of reduction to relieve weight from the limbs, Prune with 2 meter clearence from properties, thin by 20% to reduce the sail of the canopy. Both trees are in a densley built up area of houses and gardens where safety is paramount and i recommend the work needs completing asap.",
