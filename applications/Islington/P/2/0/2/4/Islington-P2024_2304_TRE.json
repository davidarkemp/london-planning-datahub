  "description": "The Ash tree located in the rear garden requires the following trimming and pruning works:\r\n- Deadwood Removal: Remove all dead, diseased, or dying branches - this tree is believed to suffer from Ash Dieback disease.\r\n- Crown thinning: thin the crown evenly by 30% mainly focusing on improving light penetration to our otherwise very dark south facing garden.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have already planted three new trees in our garden : a cherry, a fig and a magnolia.\r\n\r\nAll works would be carried out by a professional company, adhering to health and safety procedures and proper waste disposal.\r\n\r\nAccording to ELGS.co.uk trees in Islington council do not have TPO number. Please see a copy of our lease where the Ash Tree (T1) location is market in a green circle.",
