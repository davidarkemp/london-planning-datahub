  "description": "Crabapple tree last pruned around 2019.  Tree is looking very unhappy, I thought scab but have been advised by the tree surgeon that he believes it to be fire blight.  His advice is to prune around 2-3 metres representing around 30% of the canopy and that this work should be done in February/March 2025 in order to support the tree in the hope of rejuvenating it to some extent.\r\nTree surgeon is Keith Archer who has done work on this tree in the past.",
