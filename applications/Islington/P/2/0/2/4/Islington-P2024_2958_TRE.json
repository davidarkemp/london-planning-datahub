  "description": "This application is a repeat of that granted in 2022 for the Leyland Cypress, but the works were not carried out. Additionally we wish to cut back the Eucalyptus that in the gardens of both 14 Rydon St and 1 St Paul St as per the attached quote from Burnwell Trees. \r\nThe Eucalypt has not been cut back for several and now has several lower hanging branches and needs cutting to points of previous reduction.\r\nFrom 2022 application:\r\nOne Leyland Cypress at far end of my garden on corner of Rydon St and St Paul St. The tree is currently 8m tall and is blocking light to the gardens and houses at 14 Rydon St and 1 St Paul St. It is inhibiting the growth of other plants and trees within the gardens and overhangs the pavement. \r\nProposed work entails cutting the crown down to approximately 3m tall as per advice and quote from Burnwell Trees",
