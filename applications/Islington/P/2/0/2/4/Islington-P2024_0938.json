Remove epicormic growth from trunk. This tree is growing in close proximity to the road and the houses. A light reduction to the crown extremities is proposed to reduce the loading on the stems, which are considerably taller than the adjacent properties, and has been excessively crown lifted in the past resulting in a top heavy structure. There is possible included bark and internal decay at the low junction of the stems which would appear to be a historic pollard point.",
