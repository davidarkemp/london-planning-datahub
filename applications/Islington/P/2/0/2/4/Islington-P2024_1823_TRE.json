  "description": "We wish to reduce the whole crown of the sycamore tree (T1) in our front garden so that its height will be about 5m, and its spread about 3.5m. \n\nThe reason why we wish to do this is that we know for certain that the tree has not been pruned for 6 years, and believe it has not been pruned for several years before that. The trunk is quite close to the wall of our house, and some of the tree's branches are about 30cm away from our guttering. We are concerned about possible damage to the foundations of our house if the tree is not contained, and about interference with our guttering. The tree is also blocking the light to several windows. Good tree maintenance indicates to us that a crown reduction is long overdue.",
