  "description": "Rear Garden:\r\nT1:  Mature Willow:  Approximately 11.00m.  Reduce vertical upright growth back to previous reduction points (approximately 1.50-2.00m), whilst preserving ample furnishing growth to ensure crown continuity.  Preserve lateral and sub lateral weeping growth which should be thinned by approximately 20%.  Rescue over extended lateral and sub lateral growth back into main crown structure up to approximately 1.50-2.00m.  Remove major dead wood and. broken branches throughout the crown.  Raise crown by approximately 1.00-1.50m.\r\nReason:  General maintenance to reduce weight burden and wind sail area as the tree is leaning on a wall and has caused obvious wall collapse.",
