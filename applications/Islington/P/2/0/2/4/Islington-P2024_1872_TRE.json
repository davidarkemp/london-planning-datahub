Furthermore such works will have a significant impact upon the public amenity value of the tree. \r\n2.\tThe Council does not consider that it has been adequately demonstrated that the tree is a material cause in structural damage to the property in question. As such the grounds specified by the applicant/agent are not sufficient reason to justify the proposed works to the tree."

  "description": "Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima)\r\nTPO Reference No: 359\r\nTPO Title: LBI TPO (NO.359) 2007\r\n\r\nVery large tree located in the rear garden at very close proximity to 28 Noel Road, a Grade II Listed terraced house. Tree height is 20M with a 13.2M radius. It is located at 4M distance from the rear façade of the house at ground floor.\r\n\r\nCracks have appeared in the rear façade of the house and an initial structural investigation described that tree roots seem to be present under the house. There is the possibility that the tree roots under the house will continue to grow and cause further future damage to the Listed house.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a non native, fast growing species. There is also a concern for reduced lighting levels as the tree continues to grow.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons described above, which are further supported and developed in the Arboricultural Report, and in order to prevent further damage to the existing Listed house, it is proposed that the Tree is removed. In order to offset the impact of this proposal and preserve the conservation area and the views around the Regent’s Canal, it is proposed that a native species tree (eg. Honey Locust; Hornbeam; Tulip Tree) is planted in a position in the garden, which is not in close proximity to the house.",
