    "REASON: The proposal, by reason of it being a residential led development that involves the loss of existing employment floorspace, does not incorporate the maximum amount of business floorspace and provides an unacceptable quality of business floorspace, would have a detrimental impact on the Economic Growth Area's primary economic function.  It would therefore be contrary to London Plan Policies E2 and E4, Policy CS13 of the Core Strategy 2011, and Policies DM5.1, DM5.2 and DM8.6 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and and emerging Policy B1 and Policy B2 of the emerging Local Plan (2019)."
