  "description": "Approximately 7 meter high, 18 year old Acer.\r\nThe tree is situated in the middle, left hand side of my small garden.\r\nThe canopy is very wide and thick. Therefore blocking most of the sunlight from my small south facing garden for most of the day.\r\nI have recently moved to the property and am looking forward to replacing the overgrown former gravelly, rocky and grassy Zen garden. With more sympathetic, in keeping and environmentally friendly planting.\r\nThe acer would have been part of the original Zen garden plan. It has grown very large and is disproportionate to the small garden.\r\nIf planning permission is granted to remove the acerI will replace it with a more suitable tree, along with all the other planned planting.\r\nA landscape gardener and tree surgeon will carry out all planned works. Staring on Monday 7 October",
