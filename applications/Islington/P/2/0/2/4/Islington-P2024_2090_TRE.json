  "description": "The tree concerned is not under a TPO. \r\n\r\nWe would like to remove the Acacia in the rear garden under the advice of a structural engineer who advised that the tree presents a subsidence risk. It was advised that the tree is potentially close enough and sufficiently mature for its roots to extend up to and below the foundations of the rear wall causing subsidence concerns. We can provide the structural engineer report if needed. \r\n\r\nDue to the height of the tree (6 to 8 metres) this is also blocking sunlight for neighbours around us. \r\n\r\nThe tree will be fell to the ground and the stump will be grinded to below ground level.  Once the tree is removed, we will arrange low level planting in its place.",
