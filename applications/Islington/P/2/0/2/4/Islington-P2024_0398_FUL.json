    "REASON: The proposed rear dormer roof extension, by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, siting and massing, would be a dominant and discordant addition that would unacceptably interrupt the existing unaltered roofline, causing harm to the character and appearance of the host property, the wider terrace setting and the visual amenities of the Canonbury Conservation Area. It would be visually intrusive within the private views of the site from a number of neighbouring properties, particularly those in Alwyne Square. The proposed development would be contrary to the NPPF (2023), Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies PLAN1, DH1 and DH2 of the Islington Strategic and Development Management Policies (2023) and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002). It is not considered that there is sufficient public benefit to outweigh the less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset."
