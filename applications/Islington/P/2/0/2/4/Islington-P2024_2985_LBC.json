  "description": "Reconstruction of 1970s first floor extension above hallway, currently used as a bathroom\r\nReplacement of existing double-glazed casement window with sash window in keeping with period style of the building\r\nRebuilt bathroom to be in line with front door.\r\nI8 Great Percy Street was constructed in 1841. According to the Survey of London vol. XLVII), the porch was reconstructed in 1976-77. As part of this, there was a modern first floor extension including a double-glazed casement window, which is out of character with the rest of the building. We propose to rebuild this modern extension, replacing the casement window with a sash window in keeping with local vernacular. We also propose to bring the bathroom forward in line with the front door, but still set back from the main                   front elevation, which is a typical arrangement in other period properties in the area \r\nWritten advice with site visit\t£762.55 \t£152.51\t£915.06",
