  "description": "Hawthorn T1 (8 M high, multi-stemmed) - Reduce the crown of the tree overall by up to 2 metres and back to previous points of reduction\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nThis tree has a widespreading crown within a small front garden. The repeat crown reduction, last done in 2022, shall reduce overhang to the front garden of number 16 and the pavement. The crown is all but touching the front of the property so reduction shall remove likelihood of direct damage to the house. Hawthorn respond well to crown reduction and this treatment shall produce a well balanced tree for the future and the location.",
