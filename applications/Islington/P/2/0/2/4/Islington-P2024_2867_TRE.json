  "description": "One Leyland Cypress at far end of my garden on corner of Rydon St and St Paul St. The tree is currently 8m tall and is blocking light to the gardens and houses at 14 Rydon St and 1 St Paul St. It is inhibiting the growth of other plants and trees within the gardens and overhangs the pavement. \r\nProposed work entails cutting the crown down to approximately 3m tall as per advice and quote from Burnwell Trees",
