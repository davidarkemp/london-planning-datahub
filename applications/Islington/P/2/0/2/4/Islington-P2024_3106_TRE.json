  "description": "The tree ('T1') is located in the garden of 31 Amwell Street. T1 is a Bay tree: Laurus nobilis is an aromatic evergreen tree or large shrub with green, glabrous leaves. It has proximity to the structure and clear stem wounding. T1 has displaced the retaining brickwork, and root girdling is apparent within the planter. The planter has an open pit at its base, so water extraction in its direct area may be contributing to property damage. The industry-recognised management for property damage that has a potential association with tree-related vegetative water extraction, is to reduce crown volume. T1 will outgrow its location in the near future. T1 is in a poor location for a Bay (or any) tree, and it has outgrown from what should have been retained as a shrub. The proposed works are to pollard T1 to 3 meters in height and retain the tree as a high shrub. The proposal is set out in the enclosed report prepared by a chartered aborist, Paul Zepler (FdSc Arb, NC Arb, LANTRA PTI, VALIDATOR Arb).",
