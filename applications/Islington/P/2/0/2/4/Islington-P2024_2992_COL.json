    "REASON: The information submitted with the application is not considered to sufficiently satisfy the local planning authority that the operations described would be lawful under Class A, Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015, as amended, if instituted or begun at the time of the application. Specifically, the extension would front a highway and forms a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and does not meet criteria A.1e(ii) and the extension is more than 3m in depth and does not meet criterial A.1f(i).  In addition the extension is 6m in depth and a Prior Approval application is required in line with criteria A.1g rather than a Lawful Development Certificate. Therefore, the Certificate of Lawfulness for this proposed use is REFUSED."
