  "description": "Rear Garden:\r\nT1:  Mature Magnolia:  Approximately 5.00-6.00m.  Thin crown density throughout by approximately 30%.  Raise over the garden by approximately 1.00-2.00m.  Reduce crown by 1.25m, pruning over long branches back into main crown structure.  Reduce lateral and sub lateral growth back from neighbouring gardens up to 1.50m, whilst retaining screen as is practicable.  Sever the Clematis growing in the rear section of the tree and remove were practicable.\r\nReason/s:  General maintenance to control encroachment, increase light levels and improve access under the tree.",
