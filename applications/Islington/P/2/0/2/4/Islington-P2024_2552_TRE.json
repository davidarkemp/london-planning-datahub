  "description": "We have a very large lime tree at the end of our rear garden. This lime tree has a cavity which has been causing us some concern. The cavity is bellow the middle of the tree and currently supporting most of its weight. The tree is also located next to our neighbours boundary wall. We are concerned to how much weight is above the cavity, how big the tree is and how close it is to all our rear neighbours properties. \r\n\r\nThe tree surgeons have expressed some concern about this situation too. We’d prefer not to be financially liable should anything happen with the tree. \r\n\r\nThe tree surgeons suggested: “fell to below cavity cutting down to correct pruning points,  as there’s a lot of decay inside the cavity”",
