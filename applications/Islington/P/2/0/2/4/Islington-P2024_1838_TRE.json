  "description": "T1 Bay, propose to cut branches back to boundary. Large branches hanging over garden of 143 Southgate Road have damaged fencing and are blocking out all natural light to their garden\r\n\r\nT2 - Sycamore. Tree has been neglected and is overgrown, blocking light from the garden area of 143A. Propose to fell and replace with smaller tree in the same site that will be properly maintained, providing amenity and privacy without blocking light.\r\n\r\nT3 - Bay tree has been neglected and is overgrown with no lower branches, positioned too close to sycamore and blocking sun from the garden area of 143A. Propose to fell and replace with smaller tree at the back of the garden to give privacy without blocking light \r\n\r\nIn general the garden is totally overgrown and has been neglected for a number of years. Neighbours on all sides have made complaints on many occasions. We would like to overhaul the trees to maintain a healthy, biodiverse space, retaining an abundant garden of healthy trees and plants.",
