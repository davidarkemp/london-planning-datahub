    "REASON: The proposed three storey rear extension and dormer roof extension, by reason of their inappropriate design, siting, scale, massing, height and bulk are considered to form incongruous and discordant features when seen from the surrounding public and private realm. The proposal would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host property, the wider terrace and the Calabria Road Conservation Area, contrary to policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), guidance in the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017), Calabria Road Conservation Area Design Guidelines & The NPPF 2019."
