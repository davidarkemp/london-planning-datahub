    "REASON: The proposed refuse enclosure to the front garden, by reason of its inappropriate siting, scale, footprint, height, bulk, massing would form a dominant and discordant addition to the front of the property and would be readily visible from the surrounding public realm. The proposal would fail to preserve the visual appearance and historic character and would result in less than substantial harm to the host building and wider Tufnell Park Conservation Area, which is not outweighed by sufficient public benefit. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington Core Strategy Policies (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Development Management Policies (2013), the design advice within Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and Tufnell Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
