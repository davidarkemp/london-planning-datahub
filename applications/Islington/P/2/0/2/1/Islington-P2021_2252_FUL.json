    "REASON: The proposed additional two storeys by virtue of their unsympathetic design, siting, excessive scale, bulk, form, height and lack of substantial setbacks and lack of integration with the existing building would form a dominant and top heavy addition to the host building whilst  adversely affecting the established built character and special architectural and historic interest of the nearby listed buildings and conservation areas. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D4 & HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 & CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 & DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013)  and the guidance in the Urban Design Guide and Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
