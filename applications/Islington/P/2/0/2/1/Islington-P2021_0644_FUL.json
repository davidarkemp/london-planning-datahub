    "REASON: The proposed mansard roof extension by reason of its excessive scale, bulk and appearance would form a dominant and discordant feature which would be visible from the private realm and result in the breaking of an otherwise predominantly unaltered roolfine. The proposed development would neither preserve nor enhance the host locally listed building. wider terrace setting or the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies, the Urban Design Guide and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
