    "REASON: The proposed works of extension at the rear, by reason of dominant unsympathetic design, and the proposed internal works to the lower ground floor, by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form and character would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and as such fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 of the NPPF (2021) which seek to conserve and enhance the historic environment; policies D1, D4, D5 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021); policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011); policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance set out in the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
