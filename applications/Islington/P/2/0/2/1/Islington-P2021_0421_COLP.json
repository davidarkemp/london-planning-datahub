    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that this certificate relates to the current situation on site the total area of ground covered by buildings, enclosures and containers within the curtilage (other than the original dwellinghouse) would exceed 50% of the total area of the curtilage (excluding the ground area of the original dwellinghouse) and is therefore considered to be permitted development. Care needs to be taken to ensure if the extant permission ref P2020/0511 is implemented before this certificate works that this 50% requirement is adhered to otherwise the outbuilding if built after the extension may not be within the permitted development regs in this case."
