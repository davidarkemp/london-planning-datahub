    "REASON: The proposed ground floor rear extension with outdoor terrace above, by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, siting, height, massing and bulk would form a dominant and discordant feature, to the detriment of the appearance of the host building and the character of the terrace.  It would be visually harmful from private views from inside the conservation area and would neither preserve nor conserve its character, contrary to Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan; Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington's Development Policies (2013); Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and the advice given by the Islington's Urban Design Guide and the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
