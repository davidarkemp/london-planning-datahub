    "You are advised of the following comments made by TfL:\r\n-\tThe site of the proposed development is on the B144, Bunhill Road. This is not situated near any Transport for London Road Network (TLRN) and therefore considering the location, TfL have no objections.\r\n  \r\n-\tHowever, the footway and carriageway on the B144 must not be blocked during the development. Temporary obstructions must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic on the B144, Bunhill Road.\r\n\r\n-\tAll vehicles associated with the proposal must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions. In accordance with the London Plan policy T4 part E, the cumulative impacts of development on public transport and the road network capacity including walking and cycling, as well as associated effects on public health, should be considered and mitigated."
