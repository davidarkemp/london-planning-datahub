    "REASON: The proposed works by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form / loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric, unsympathetic design and insufficient information/justification would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, with no public benefit which outweighs this harm, contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's character) and CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 (Design) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
