    "REASON: The proposed terrace area, rooflight and associated railings by reason of their excessive prominent siting, design, scale, footprint and form would form a discordant addition to the property and would be uncharacteristic to the host Victorian Building and harmful to its architectural character rear roofline rhythm, unity and overall integrity as a terrace dwelling and its setting within the wider terrace of properties. The incongruous additions would further result in visual clutter which would disrupt the rhythm and unity of this group of properties to the detriment of the appearance of the surrounding Barnsbury Conservation Area.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy 12 of National Planning Policy Framework (2021); Policies HC1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011); policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management (2013) and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
