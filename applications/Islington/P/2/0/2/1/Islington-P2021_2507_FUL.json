    "REASON: The proposed extension over the existing two storey rear addition, by reason of its inappropriate siting,  scale, bulk, massing and height would form a dominant and discordant addition to the rear of the locally listed building, wider terrace setting and Conservation Area when seen from both the public and private realm.  The proposal would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the locally listed building, wider terrace setting and the conservation area. The development is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
