    "The proposed development would be contrary to the requirements of Class AA of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. The proposal does not meet the requirements of paragraph AA.2 3(a)(i) as a comprehensive Daylight and Sunlight Assessment is required to ensure there will not be any negative amenity impacts for surrounding residential buildings in relation to loss of light. The design of the proposal does not meet the requirements of paragraph AA.2 3(a)(ii) as the design of the principle elevation of the building would also be negatively affected. The overall design of the development is also concluded to be contrary to the principles of the NPPF 2019, Policy DM2.1 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) as well as Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017)."
