    "REASON: The proposed change to the pitch of the rear portion of the consented roof extension would result in the creation of additional bulk and scale of the approved development. These proposals are material amendments which give rise to design and neighbouring amenity implications which would need to be fully assessed as part of a Full Planning application. Therefore, the non-material amendments proposed within this application are not agreed."
