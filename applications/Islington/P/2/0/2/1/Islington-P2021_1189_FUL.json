    "The proposed works of external alterations to the front lightwell, railings, rear  lightwell and rear elevation, by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, lack of information and unsympathetic design, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building as well as failing to preserve the character and appearance of  New River Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage assets, with no public benefit which outweighs this harm, contrary to Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policy D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011; Policies 2.1 & 2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guidance, and the New River Conservation Area Design Guide."
