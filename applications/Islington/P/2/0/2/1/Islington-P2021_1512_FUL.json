    "Reason : 1 - The proposed works by virtue of their detrimental impact on the loss of historic fabric and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and as such detract from the character and appearance of the Duncan Terrace/Colebrook Row Conservation Area . The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension fails the 45-degree rule test as outlined in the BRE guidance and insufficient inforrmation (daylight sunlight analysis) has been submitted to confirm that sufficient light will be retained for the rear windows of the adjoining properties and as such protect neighbours amenity. It  would therefore be contrary with Policy DM2.1 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
