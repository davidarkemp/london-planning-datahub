  "subdivision_of_building": "The proposal is for a Mansard extension to be erected on top of a single fronted, 3 storey, mid-terrace Victorian house.\n\nThe materials of the properties along the street façade are generally consistent and are predominantly a London brick with some of the properties feature a rendered or painted brick finish. All of the properties along the street feature a high parapet wall\nto the front and a butterfly roof to the rear. The proposed mansard which would be clad in slate roof tiles to match the existing roof coverings along the street, would be stepped back to eliminate the visual impact from the street level. The rear butterfly effect roof/parapet walls to the rear would be kept in place, simply with the mansard stepped back behind it. We understand the need to preserve local architectural features such as the butterfly roof effect as noted with the Islington Design Guide 2006, but the butterfly roof is only visible from the gardens of the neighbouring properties and from one point along Hornsey Road. Our proposal is sensitive to the existing features and maintains the butterfly effect to the rear of the property. We have demonstrated through a series of drawings the visual effect of the proposal. Whilst the mansard may appear to visible from the 2D elevation drawings, when the proposal is built up, out of the sightline when standing on the pavement in front of the house. It is only when the proposal is\nviewed from the standard architectural Isometric view that is becomes visible. The only important view is the one from the actual street level, as this is the view that provides and maintains any character of the street and neighbouring roads.",
