    "REASON: The proposed roof terrace, by reason of its location and proximity to adjoining residential properties, would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of adjacent residents and to the occupiers of the flat below through loss of privacy & unneighbourly overlooking. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Policy DM2.1 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013)."
