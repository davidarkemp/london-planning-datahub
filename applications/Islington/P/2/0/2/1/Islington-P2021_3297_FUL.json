    "REASON: By reason of their scale, loss of historic roof form, visibility in public views and in the absence of a legal agreement to secure the provision of a consistent roof line, the proposed mansard roof extensions to the properties within the terraced row would form a dominant and discordant addition to the wider terrace setting. The development would further erode the largely unaltered roofline, disrupting the rhythm, uniformity and integrity of the terrace that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Arlington Square Conservation Area and the setting of the Grade II Listed Buildings. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D1 (London's form, character and capacity for growth), D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's Character) and CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 (Design), DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013 and guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
