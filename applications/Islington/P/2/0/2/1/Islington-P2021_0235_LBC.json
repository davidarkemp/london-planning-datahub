    "REASON: The proposed works to add a garden building in the rear garden by virtue of its lack of setback and proximity to the historic boundary walls would cause harm to existing fabric and adversely affect the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage asset, with no public benefits which outweighs this harm, contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy HC1 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
