  "description": "Large sycamore tree diseased on one side of base has been pruned, it is located adjacent to the rear garden wall. Has now reached such a height that it protrudes above the five storey house with a spread that covers the neighbouring gardens to the rear and the side. I have received complaints from both neighbours bypressing their concerns over the stability of the sycamore in high winds and the seed and leaf drop in Autumn and excessive shade. I request permission to fell the sycamore and would like to replace it with two silver birow pendula trees.",
