    "REASON: The proposed works, by virtue of their inappropriate design, detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric and through lack of information would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, with no public benefit which outweighs this harm, contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
