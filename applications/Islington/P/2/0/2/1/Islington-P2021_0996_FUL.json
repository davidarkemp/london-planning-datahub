    "REASON: The cumulative visual impact of both the main rear dormer and rear outrigger roof extension  by reason of their inappropriate design, scale, siting, massing, form and bulk  would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host property and wider terrace setting. The addition would be readily visible from the surrounding private realm and would cause clear visual harm and would therefore be contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Policy 2013 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
