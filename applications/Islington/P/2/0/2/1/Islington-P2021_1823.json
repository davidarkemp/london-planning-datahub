  "description": "Tree in adjacent property is tall and unmanaged with roots erupting through paving and the cracking the brick party wall. We are a GP surgery and this is an urgent trip hazard. The council's tree surgeons / surveyor have told us we need to trim the tree roots and we urgently need to do this. We also wish the council to specify the work and accept that any work on the roots may run the risk of introducing infection. We have submitted a complaint as we believe the tree needs managing for safety. The council have indicated our insurers should pay but they have told us the council are responsible while this is resolved we need to urgently resolve the paved area trip hazard.",
