    "REASON: Due to the proposed height, siting, appearance and mass, the proposed monopole and associated equipment would cause visual clutter and would be dominant and discordant in the streetscene and when viewed from the adjoining St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area would therefore cause harm to the surrounding character and appearance of the wider streetscene and conservation area. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy, policies DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM2.7 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
