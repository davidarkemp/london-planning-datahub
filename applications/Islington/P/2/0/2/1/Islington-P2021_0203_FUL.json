    "REASON: The proposed two storey extension, by reason of its height, depth and location, would form a visually dominant addition which would fail to be visually subordinate to the host building. The extension would be visible from the surrounding private realm and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property, wider terrace and conservation area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 196 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), Islington's Urban Design (2017) and the Aberdeen Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
