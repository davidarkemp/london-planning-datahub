    "REASON: The proposed side extensions and front bin enclosure by reason of their inappropriate design, scale, bulk, siting, height and massing would adversely affect the character and appearance of the building and the wider terrace within which the building forms a part of. As such it would fail to preserve or enhance and thereby result in harm to the visual appearance and historic character of the Barnsbury Conservation Area, which would not be outweighed by sufficient public benefits. It is therefore contrary to the NPPF 2021, and policies D1, D4, and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Islington Core Strategy Policies (2011) CS8 and CS9, and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), and the design advice found within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
