    "Reason : 1 - REASON: The proposed two storey dwellings by reason of their piecemeal approach to backland development would appear unduly dominant when seen within the immediate context comprising single storey garage buildings. The failure to provide a comprehensive re-development of the whole site facilitates an unsightly form of development that lacks uniformity and a holistic form of development. The proposal would therefore appear unsympathetic and highly disjointed and cause clear visual harm to the character and appearance of the Sotheby Road Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 (design) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and National Planning Policy Framework (2021).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - REASON: The proposed two storey dwellings by reason of their inappropriate scale, massing, siting, bulk and detailed design would form a dominant and discordant form of development that fails to appear appropriate within their immediate setting adjacent to single storey garages. The proposal would erode the open and spacious character of the site and the surrounding Sotheby Road Conservation Area and would be readily visible and appreciated from the surrounding private realm. The proposal would cause clear visual harm to the character and appearance of the Sotheby Road Conservation Area with no overriding public benefits to outweigh this clear visual harm. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 (design) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "Reason : 3 - REASON: The proposed north-west facing windows at first floor level would provide direct overlooking to habitable room windows at the rear of no.11 Kelross Road and would therefore cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of adjacent and nearby residential units through overlooking and loss of privacy to habitable room windows.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Plan 2013",
    "Reason : 4 - REASON: The proposal fails to provide a fully inclusive environment in line with Category 2 of the National Standard for Housing Design as set out in the Approved Document M 'Accessible and adaptable dwellings' M4(2) contrary to London Plan policy 3.8 and the Islington Inclusive Design SPD (2014)",
    "Reason : 5 - REASON: The proposed dwellings are considered to provide sub-standard accommodation as they would not provide any defensible space from the sole entrance to each dwelling, nor would adequate private amenity spaces be provided at ground floor level. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan 2021; Policy CS12 (meeting the housing challenge) of Islington Council's Core Strategy 2011; Policies DM3.4 (Housing standards) and DM3.5 (Private outdoor space) of the Development Management Plan 2013",
    "Reason : 6 - REASON: The proposed development would not be car free as it results in the creation of 1no secure parking space attributed to one of the proposed new self-contained dwellinghouses. The proposals also fails to ensure that pedestrians, private and service vehicles could enter and exit the site in a safe and appropriate manner. Furthermore, the application fails to consider access arrangements for fire vehicles in the event of an emergency. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy CS10 of the Core Strategy 2011, and Policies DM8.1, DM8.5 and DM8.6 of the Development Management Policies 2013"
