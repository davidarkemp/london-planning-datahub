    "REASON: Reason: The cumulative development of proposed roof extension, rear terrace rea and associated railings by reason of their inappropriate design, scale, siting and form would present an dominant and discordant feature that would interrupt the rhythm and roof form of the existing buildings and wider terrace leading to overbearing visual impact from both private views and public views from nearby Fitzwarren Gardens. As such, it would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the existing dwelling house and surrounding Whitehall Park conservation area. The proposal is therefore considered not to be in line with the NPPF (2019), Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Whitehall Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
