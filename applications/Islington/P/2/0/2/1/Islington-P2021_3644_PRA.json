    "REASON: The proposed development, due to its design, height and prominent siting, would have harm and detrimental impact on the character and visual amenity of the local area and adjacent Conservation Area. As a result of this, the proposed telecommunication equipment would negatively affect the surrounding area and fail to respond appropriately to the local context in terms of design, scale, height and massing. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM2.7 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
