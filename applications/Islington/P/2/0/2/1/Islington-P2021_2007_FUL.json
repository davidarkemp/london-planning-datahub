    "REASON: The proposed dormer roof extension, by reason of its inappropriate design, scale and massing, would form a dominant and discordant feature which would severely interrupt the existing unaltered roofline and be harmful to the character and appearance of the building, wider terrace setting and conservation area. The works would therefore cause 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the heritage assets, with no public benefit which outweighs this harm, contrary to Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011); policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), the St John's Grove Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2008) and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines (2017)."
