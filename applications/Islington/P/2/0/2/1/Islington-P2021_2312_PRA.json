    "REASON:Due to their siting and appearance, the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as dominant and discordant additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location, cluttering the roof, and would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the Northampton Square Conservation Area and associated Heritage assets.  The proposal is therefore contrary policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS7, CS8 and CS9 of Islington Core Strategy (2011) policies DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM2.7 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
