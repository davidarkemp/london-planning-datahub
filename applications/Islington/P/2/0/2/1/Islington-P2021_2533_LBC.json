    "REASON: The proposed works, by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, unsympathetic design and dominating size of extensions, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to Chapter 16 of the NPPF (2021) which seek to conserve and enhance the historic environment; policies D1, D4, D5 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021); policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011); policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance set out in the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
