    "REASON: The proposed works of creating another floor level within the existing roof, which involve internal alterations inserting a new staircase as well as external changes with a double dormer aligned with the ridge, by virtue of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric, bulk, massing and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraphs 195 and 202 of Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies HC1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington’s Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington’s Development Management Policies (2013), guidance contained within Islington’s Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington’s Urban Design Guide (2017)."
