    "REASON: The proposed upward roof level extension, by reason of its inappropriate siting, design, scale, height, massing is considered to form a dominant and discordant feature which would harmfully interrupt the existing unaltered and legible roofline, form and height of the modern mews and would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host building, mews row and the wider area when seen from the surrounding public and private realm.  The proposed development is considered to be contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy (2011); DM2.1 of the Development Management policies 2013 and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines 2017."
