    "The proposed development, due to its design, height and prominent siting, would have serious harm and detrimental impact on the character and visual amenity of the local area and pedestrian road, adding clutter to the pedestrian footpath. As a result of this, the proposed additional telecommunication equipment would negatively affect the surrounding area and fail to respond appropriately to the local context in terms of design, scale, height and massing. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS8 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.7 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide 2017."
