    "REASON: The proposed works, by reason of detrimental impact on the historic plan form and circulation, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic and dominant design and through lack of information would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and the character and appearance of the conservation area. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets  contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy HC1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 andDM2.3 of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013, the Urban Design Guide and Conservation Area Guidelines."
