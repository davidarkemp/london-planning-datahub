    "CONDITION: Notwithstanding the drawings hereby approved, further details of a privacy screen shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to works commencing on site.  The details of the privacy screeen shall be an obscure material and installed along the terrace flank (staring from rear elevation of building) with the shared boundary with no.93 Huddleston Road to a finished height of 1.7m above finished floor level. \r\n\r\nThe privacy screening shall be installed prior to the first use of the terrace and strictly in accordance with this condition and permanently maintained thereafter.\r\n\r\nNo changes shall occur unless an alternative solution is agreed to in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\n\r\nREASON: To ensure the amenities of neighbouring occupiers are not compromised by the proposed terrace by way of undue loss of privacy and overlooking into habitable living areas."
