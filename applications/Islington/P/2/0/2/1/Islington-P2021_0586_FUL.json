    "REASON: The proposed rear dormer would unacceptably interrupt the existing unaltered and legible rear roofline, and by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, siting and bulk scale would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace setting and the surrounding Hillmarton Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2012), Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017) and Design and Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
