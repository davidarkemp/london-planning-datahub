    "REASON: The roof extension is considered to form a discordant feature due to its overall design including the loss of original butterfly feature and the build-up of the mansard roof on the rear wall as well as larger party walls which creates a bulkier appearance together with the creation of a front roof terrace which would lead to visual clutter from the street scene. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the locally listed building, wider terrace setting and the surrounding conservation area. The development is considered to be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011); policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), the Arlington Square Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines (2017)."
