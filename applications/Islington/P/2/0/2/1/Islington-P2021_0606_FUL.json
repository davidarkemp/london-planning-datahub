    "REASON: The proposed development, by virtue of its excessive scale, inappropriate siting and detailed design, would form a discordant and dominant addition that would harm the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace setting and surrounding conservation area. The size and siting of the roof extension is not subservient to the host building. The front rooflights are not permitted in the conservation area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Whitehall Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
