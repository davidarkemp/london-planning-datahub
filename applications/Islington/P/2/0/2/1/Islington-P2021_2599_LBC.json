    "REASON: The proposed works, by reason of detrimental impact on the historic plan form and circulation, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic and dominant design and through lack of information would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
