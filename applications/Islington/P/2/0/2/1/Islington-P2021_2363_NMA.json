    "REASON: The combination of the extent of the proposed increase in building height and addition of a parapet wall are of such a scale and intent, as to materially alter the approved scheme. Therefore the proposals constitute a material change to the approved scheme. As such, the proposed amendments would not therefore constitute a non-material amendment and will require planning permission."
