    "REASON: The proposed works by virtue of their detrimental impact on the external appearance, historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, with no public benefit to outweigh this harm, contrary to paragraphs 199, 200 and 202 of Chapter 16  of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies HC1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and  DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013 and guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
