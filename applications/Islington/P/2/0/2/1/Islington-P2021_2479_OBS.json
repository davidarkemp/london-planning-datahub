    "It is advised that London Borough of Islington raises NO OBJECTIONS but concern is raised to the design and heritage impacts of the proposal. \r\n\r\nEvaluation:\r\nThe nearest part of the application site is some 700 meters away from the LB Islington boundary. None of Islington's protected local views pass over the site, nor do any strategic views which also pass over Islington.\r\n\r\nDue to the distance of the application site from LB Islington's boundary, it is not considered that the proposal would have a harmful impact on Islington. \r\n\r\nThis application has been considered with regard to its impact on the London Borough of Islington and its residents. Whilst no objections are raised due to the site's considerable distance from the borough boundary, concern is raised regarding the design of the proposal and the impact it would have on the nearby Bevis Marks Synagogue."
