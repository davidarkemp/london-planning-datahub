    "REASON: The proposed use of the rear garden for seating and eating/ drinking along with the proposed opening of rear windows and doors to the ground floor commercial unit would have a significant detrimental impact on the amenity of occupiers of nearby residential properties due to increased noise, odour pollution and disturbance to the surrounding area as a direct result of the use of the rear garden and the opening of rear windows and doors of the ground floor commercial unit. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D14 of London Plan (2021) and policy DM2.1Ax of Development Management Policies (2013) and there are no material considerations which justify granting planning permission subject to different conditions from those imposed on the previously approved application dated 31/03/2021 (Ref: P2020/1364/FUL) expressly for the purpose of mitigating the issues that form the basis for the current refusal."
