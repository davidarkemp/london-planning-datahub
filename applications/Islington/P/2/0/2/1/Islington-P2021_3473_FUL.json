    "REASON: The proposed mansard roof extension by reason of its excessive scale, bulk and appearance would form a dominant and discordant feature which would be visible from the private realm and result in the breaking of an otherwise predominantly unaltered roolfine. The proposed development would neither preserve nor enhance the host locally listed building. wider terrace setting or the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies, the Urban Design Guide and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."

  "description": "Demolition of existing pitched roof and erection of new mansard roof extension, partial demolition and rebuild of the three storey rear outrigger, removal of an existing timber infill lean-to extension, erection of a rear upper ground floor brick infill extension with a flat parapet roof and new glazed roof lantern, and erection of a full width lower ground floor extension at the rear with a traditional lead roof and timber joinery. The works will also include installation of a new gate and new metal stairs to the front lightwell, removal of the bitumen coating to the front steps and reform with traditional stone, removal of the existing casement window in the lower ground floor entrance lobby, removal of existing exterior door in lower ground floor entrance lobby and replacement with new sash window, widening and partial lowering of existing front lower ground floor window on front facade. The assumed existing vault is to be unblocked, reinstated and tanked. Additional localised mortar repairs are proposed along with the installation of traditional style metal balcony at the rear upper ground floor doors serving the kitchen",
