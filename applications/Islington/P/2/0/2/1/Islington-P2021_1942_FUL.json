    "REASON: The proposed dormer and roof terrace, by reason of their inappropriate scale, detailed design, materials, bulk, siting  and appearance would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host building and wider terrace setting. The proposal would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and wider streetscene and is contrary to Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 Policy CS8 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
