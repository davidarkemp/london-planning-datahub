    "REASON: The proposed development would be contrary to the requirements of paragraph AA.2 3(a)(ii) of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as the design of the principle elevation of the building would be negatively affected. The overall design of the development is concluded to be contrary to the principles of the NPPF 2019, Policy CS8 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), Policy DM2.1 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) as well as Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017)."
