    "REASON: The proposed works by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the designated listed building and as such fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the desingated heritage assets contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017) and the guidance within the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area Guidelines (2002)."
