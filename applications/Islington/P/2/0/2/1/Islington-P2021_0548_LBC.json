    "REASON: The proposed works would cause harm to the historic plan form of the listed building, involve an unacceptable loss of historic fabric, and would erode the visual and spatial distinction between the historic plan form of the rear basement room and the new extension which it adjoins. The proposals would therefore adversely affect the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building, and cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to the objectives of Chapter 16 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and Policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
