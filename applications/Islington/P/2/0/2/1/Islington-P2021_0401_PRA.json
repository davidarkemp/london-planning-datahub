    "REASON: The proposed pole and supporting cabinets, due to their height, siting, appearance and mass, would cause visual clutter and would be dominant and discordant in the streetscene would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the wider streetscene.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), D1, D4 and D8 of the London Plan (2021), policiesCS8 and CS15 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1, DM2.7 and DM6.5 of the Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide 2017."
