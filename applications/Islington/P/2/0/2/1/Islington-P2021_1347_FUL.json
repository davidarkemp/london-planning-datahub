    "REASON: The proposed roof extensions by reason of their excessive design, siting, scale, depth, bulk and massing are considered to form a dominant and top heavy addition to the host property and wider terrace setting being visible form the surrounding private and public realm. The development would subsume and jarr visually with the existing terrace and wider terrace setting.  The development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy DM2.1 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017, Conservation Area Guide & the NPPF 2019."
