    "REASON: The proposed roof terrace with high level metal balustrade railings by reason of its overall unsympathetic size, bulk, design and siting would form an incongruous and discordant addition to the host property and wider area.  The development would be readily visible from the surrounding private realm and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and wider conservation area. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies D1 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013). It also contravenes the guidance within the Urban Design Guide (2017), Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and the NPPF (2021)."
