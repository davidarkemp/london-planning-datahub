    "Reason : 1 - REASON: The roof extension, reason of its height, scale and prominent location, forms a dominant and discordant feature which severely interrupts the existing roofline and is harmful to the character and appearance of the building, wider terrace setting and the surrounding area. The development is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS8 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011); policy DM2.1 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - REASON: The rear extension, by reason of its size, siting, height, bulk, design and rearward projection, has a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host property and the existing street scene contrary to Policy CS8 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policy DM 2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the  Islington Urban Design Guide (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - REASON: The extract duct, by reason of its design, size, height and prominent location, has a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host property and the existing street scene contrary to Policy CS8 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policy DM 2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - REASON: The rear extension, by reason of its height, depth and proximity to other residential properties, would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of adjacent and nearby residential buildings through overbearing and loss of outlook.  The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that there will not be any impact on adjacent and nearby residential buildings through loss of daylight and sunlight. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), as well as BRE 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice' (Second Edition 2011).\r\n"
