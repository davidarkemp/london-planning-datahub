    "REASON: The proposed development, by reason of their inappropriate design, siting and appearance would form discordant additions which would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace setting and surrounding Barnsbury Conservation Area and is therefore inconsistent with the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017, and the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
