    "REASON: The proposed dormers and associated internal works by virtue of their detrimental impact on the historic roof form, loss of historic fabric, and unsympathetic design and prominent siting would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and the character and appearance of the conservation area.  The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset, with no public benefit to outweigh the harm, contrary to paragraph 196 of the NPPF 2019, policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
