    "The phasing of the development without time limits would cause unacceptable harm due to the implementation of a double storey roof extension centrally within the terrace row, This would lead  to a dominant and discordant feature which would severely interrupt the existing unaltered roofline by reason of its scale, design and form. It would result in detrimental harm to the character and appareance of the building, the terrrace as a whole and wider  locality including the adjacent Regent's Canal West Conservation Area.The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF 2019, Policy D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Regent's Canal West Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
