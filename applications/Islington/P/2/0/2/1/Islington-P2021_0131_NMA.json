    "REASON: The proposed omission of the previously approved metal roof screens that would fold onto the balconies of the new sixth and seventh floors and inclusion of brickwork to sections of the glazed rear elevation would represent material alterations to the previously approved scheme, The alterations may therefore give rise to design, standard of accomodation and  amenity implications which would need to be fully assessed within a Section 73 or Full Planning application. Therefore, the proposed amendment would constitute a material amendment to the approved scheme and the non-material amendments proposed within this application are not agreed."
