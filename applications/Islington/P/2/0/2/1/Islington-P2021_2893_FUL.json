    "REASON: The proposed addition of the ASHP, by reason of it's inappropriate siting, unsympathetic design and unsuitable location within the front lightwell of the host locally listed property would be a discordant addition to the front of the property  which would be visible within the Conservation Area  and surrounding public realm and would have a detrimental impact on the host locally building and adversely affect the special character and appearance of the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause clear harm to the significance of the heritage assets, with no  overriding public benefit to outweighs this identified visual harm, contrary to Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013 guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines and Urban Design Guide 2017."
