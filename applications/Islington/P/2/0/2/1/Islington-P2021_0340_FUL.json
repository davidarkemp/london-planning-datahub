    "REASON: The proposed works by reason of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, historic circulation, harm to the retained fabric, and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the designated building. As such, it would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Canonbury Conservation Area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
