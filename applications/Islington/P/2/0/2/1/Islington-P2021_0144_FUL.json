    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate scale, height, siting, detailed design and prominent location, is considered to form a dominant and discordant feature which would harmfully contribute to the erosion of the predominantly unaltered roofline which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host property, wider terrace and the conservation area being readily visible from surrounding public and private views.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011); Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management policies 2013, the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Urban Design Guidelines 2017."
