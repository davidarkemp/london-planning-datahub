    "REASON: The proposal would have a detrimental impact on the retail and service function of this local shopping area. The development has failed to adequately justify/evidence this development through robust marketing evidence or retail impact assessment on the impact on nearby Town Centres. Therefore, the development is considered to be non-compliant with the aims and character of the Local Shopping Area and subsequently fails to comply with Policy SD6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS3 of the Core Stratetty (2011) policies DM4.1, DM4.3, DM4.4 and DM4.6 of the Development Management Policies Document (2013) and the NPPF 2021."
