Erection of a first floor extension and internal alterations to the existing structure to facilitate conversion of the existing ancillary car park internal plant and storage areas (B1 use) into offices (B1 use).  Installation of new plant equipment on the roof.  Provision of new refuse storage facilities and associated works.\" The S73 application seeks permission to remove the cycle parking serving the offices within the \"main\" Finwell House building that were previously approved within the rear Annexe building to Finwell house (a former car park), so that the Main Building and Annexe are functionally independent. A new bin store is also proposed to be introduced in the courtyard area.",
