    "The proposed works of rebuilding the rear extension and internal alterations by virtue of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form, loss of historic fabric, harm to the retained fabric, unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would therefore cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 195/196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
