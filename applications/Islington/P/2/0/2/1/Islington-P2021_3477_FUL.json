    "REASON: The proposed addition of the pv panels to the front roofslope, by reason of their inappropriate siting, unsympathetic design and unsuitable location would be a discordant addition to the front of the property  which would be visible fom public views within the Conservation Area and surrounding public realm and would have a detrimental impact on the host building and the historic character and appearance of the St John's Grove Conservation Area. The works would therefore cause clear harm to the significance of the heritage assets, with insufficient overriding public benefit to outweigh this identified visual harm, contrary to Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013 guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Urban Design Guide 2017."
