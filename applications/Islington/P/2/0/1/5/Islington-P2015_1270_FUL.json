The proposed development would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the property and wider locality.  The proposal would fail to conserve and enhance the character and appearance of the East Canonbury Conservation Area contrary to policy CS9 of the Adopted Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Adopted Development Management Policies (2013), the Conservation Area Design Guidance and  Islington's Urban Design Guide 2006."
