  "description": "The existing asphalt roof and promenade tiles will be lifted and cleared from site. The surface will then be prepared to receive two coats of 19mm asphalt. A lead apron will be then be fixed in accordance with BS 6915 to provide more effective cover to the wall. Promenade tiles to match existing will then be laid. There is also significant cracking evident to the external render. This will be gently removed using a hammer and bolster. Care will be taken to ensure the brickwork is unaffected when removing the render. In order to ensure the integrity of the brickwork the render will be removed by hand in small sections. The brickwork is to be cleaned using water and a wire brush, removing any grime. At this point it will be inspected and should the need arise repairs will be made. Repointing where necessary will be carried out by raking out existing joints of brickwork minimum 12mm deep and repointing in mortar and remove spoil. A lime based render will then be applied and painted white to match existing. 2.2 Justification",
