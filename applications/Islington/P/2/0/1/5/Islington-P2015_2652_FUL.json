    "The proposed development, by reason of the size, height, bulk, scale and poor quality of design (including the external structural elements, roof top plant, the external appearance and poor relationship between the existing and new built form) would represent an incongruous and visually intrusive form of development which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original building, and to the character and appearance of the street scene and the surrounding area, the proposal also fails to provide a high quality design appropriate to the site's prominent location at the junction of the busy Essex and Balls Pond Roads, and is contrary to London Plan (2015) policy 7.6, Islington's Core Strategy (2011) policy CS9, Islington's Development Management Polices (2013) policy DM2.1, Islington's Local Plan Site Allocations (2013) Site OI3, and the Islington Urban Design Guide SPD.  The benefits of the scheme are not considered to outweigh this harm."
