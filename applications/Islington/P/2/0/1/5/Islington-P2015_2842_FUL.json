    "REASON: The proposed installation of insulation of 110mm in depth to the outside external walls of the side and rear elevations of the property would cause unacceptable visual harm to the character and appearance of the host building and wider terrace due to the impact on the window reveals and on the existing relationship with the adjoining properties visible in views of the rear and side elevations of the building. The proposed alterations visual harm are not considered to be outweighed by the sustainability benefits of the scheme and would fail to reserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and wider conservation area setting. The works are, therefore, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), and Policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and Policy DM2.1 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
