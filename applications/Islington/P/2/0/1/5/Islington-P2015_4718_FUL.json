    "REASON: The proposal fails to satisfactorily demonstrate a lack of demand for the A1 retail unit and fails to show that the proposed use would not have an adverse effect on the vitality, viability and predominantly retail function of the Local Shopping Area. The proposed development would therefore cause the loss of retail floor space within a designated Local Shopping Area, and as a result will diminish the potential amount and range of local shopping services available to the local community. Therefore the proposal is contrary to policy CS14 (Retail and services) of the Core Strategy (2011) and policy DM4.6 (Local Shopping Areas) of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013) and policy BC8 of the Finsbury Local Plan (2013)."
