    "The proposed development's 7-storey block, due to its excessive height and massing and its visual prominence and proposed location, would fail to relate positively to its surroundings, would appear unduly overdominant, would be harmful to local townscape, and would adversely affect the setting of the adjacent Tufnell Park Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
