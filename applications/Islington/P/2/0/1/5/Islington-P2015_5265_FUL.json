    "REASON: The proposed extension and alterations result in the loss of the existing uniformity and coherency on the front elevation of the host building and adjoining properties within the purpose built residential development. As a result the proposals result in an incongruous and disproportionate relationship with the adjoining properties causing unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding purpose built residential development. Therefore the proposal is unacceptable, contrary to policy 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2015), policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
