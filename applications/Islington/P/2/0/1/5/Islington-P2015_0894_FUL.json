    "REASON: The cumulative impact of the loss of the sash window on the lower ground floor front elevation and the replacement of the existing door to the front lightwell with a window would represent an unsympathetic and discordant feature undermining the coherence and quality of the frontage. Therefore the proposals adverse affect the host building, adjoining terrace and surrounding St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore unacceptable and contrary to policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2015), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013) and guidance contained within the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006), the St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
