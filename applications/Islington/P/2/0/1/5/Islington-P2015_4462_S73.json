    "REASON: The proposed additional storey and external alterations including the perforated brick screens and recessed balconies to the front elevation by reason of their inappropriate design,  scale, bulk, massing and height would form a visually overbearing, dominant and detrimental feature when seen from both the public and private realm. For these reasons the proposed alterations are harmful to the appearance of the building, the character of the streetscene, fails to preserve the character and appearance of the East Canonbury Conservation Area.  The proposal is contrary to the guidance within the Urban Design Guide 2006, Conservation Area Design Guidelines, Islington's Development Management Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3, CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and the NPPF (2012)."
