    "Temporary 4 Year Permission\r\n\r\nCONDITION: The permission is granted for a temporary four (4) year period only, covering the following football seasons:\r\n2015/2016\r\n2016/2017\r\n2017/2018\r\n2019/2020\r\n\r\nThe applicant shall submit for approval further coach parking proposals for approval in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of the 2020/2021 football season. \r\n\r\nREASON: In the interests of ensuring that the coach parking arrangements around the Emirates Football stadium are the most effective and efficient for protecting the amenity of nearby occupiers in the future as well as minimising and disruption to the highway network. The temporary timeframe would enable the potential for future improvements to technology and therefore a potential alternative coach parking scenario that still accords with Anti-Terror Advice may be found in the future."
