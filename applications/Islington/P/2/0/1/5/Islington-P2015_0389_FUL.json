    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would be an inappropriate addition to this terrace of properties, visually disrupting the existing roofscape with a largely unaltered roofline, and would substantially harm the significance of the East Canonbury Conservation Area.  Therefore the proposal would represent an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the setting of the Locally Listed building, the integrity of the terrace and the character and appearance of the East Canonbury Conservation area. The proposal is contrary to policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and guidance contained within the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and in particular sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, the East Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and in particular paragraphs 23.7 and 23.9."
