    "After consultation with the agent the original specification for an overall crown reduction by 20% and crown lift to fence height and has now been changed to the approved works \r\n The reason for this is that the work is not  justified as there is not a sound arboricultural reason given to do so. There are no major defects to the tree and the tree has room to grow in future years.\r\nThe works would have caused larger unnecessary wounds and the tree would have reacted with faster growth leading to a bushy effect of the crown."
