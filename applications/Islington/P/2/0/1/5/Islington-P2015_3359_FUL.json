    "REASON: The proposal would result in a reduction in the proportion of retail units within a designated primary retail frontage and fails to provide evidence of two years of substantive marketing and vacancy evidence to demonstrate that there is no reasonable possibility that the unit could be brought back into use for A1 retail. The application also fails to show that the proposed use would not have an adverse effect on the vitality, viability and predominantly retail function of the Town Centre. Therefore the proposal is contrary to the aims of policy CS14 (Retail and services) of the Core Strategy (2011) and policy DM4.5 (Primary and Secondary Frontages) of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013)."
