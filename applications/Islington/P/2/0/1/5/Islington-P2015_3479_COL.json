    "To assist applicants in a positive manner, the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Council's website. \r\n\r\nA pre-application advice service is also offered and encouraged.\r\n\r\nWhilst no pre-application discussions were entered into, the policy advice and guidance available on the website was followed by the applicant.\r\n\r\nThe applicant therefore worked in a proactive manner taking into consideration the policies and guidance available to them, and therefore the LPA delivered a positive decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF."
