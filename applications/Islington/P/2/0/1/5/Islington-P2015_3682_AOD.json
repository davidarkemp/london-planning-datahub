    "Whilst TfL acknowledges that no works are proposed on the TLRN, the applicant is reminded that any works on the TLRN would require the approval of TfL in the form of a Section 278 agreement (Highways Act 1980). \r\n\r\nTfL is satisfied with the wording of the conditions in relation to a Delivery Service Plan and Construction Management Plan which are to be submitted to TfL and local authority's approval prior to the first occupation of the site. As access to the site will be largely from the rear, it is not envisage that this will impact the TLRN however servicing/construction vehicles must not block the footway and carriageway during the construction period. \r\n\r\nShould the applicant wish to install scaffolding or a hoarding on the footway whilst undertaking this work, separate licences may be required with TfL, please see, https://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/urban-planning-and-construction/highway-licences."
