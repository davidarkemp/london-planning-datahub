    "REASON(S) FOR REFUSAL:\r\n1\tThe proposed crown reduction would be detrimental to the tree health and the amenity and environmental benefits that the trees provide. The works have been refused for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1.\tLack of arboricultural justification  for the proposed crown reduction works for overhanging branches.\r\n\r\n2.\tLoss of amenity and associated environmental benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour attention is drawn to any INFORMATIVES that may be listed below:\r\n\r\n1\tInformatives:\r\n\r\nLack of Arboricultural Justification:\r\n\r\nThe tree is in apparent good health, form and vigor with no obvious irredeemable defects.  No arboricultural justification has been supplied for the crown reduction of the tree. The council is under no obligation to permit any works other than the minimal works to abate a nuisance or for reasons of health and safety.\r\n.  \r\nThe council considers it is reasonable to refuse any further works which would be detrimental to the health and amenity of the trees. The pruning works proposed  will lead to unnecessary wounds and the possibility of decay to the mature tree will be greater.\r\n\r\nLoss of Amenity and Environmental benefits\r\n\r\nA site visit by the tree officer did not reveal any sound arboricultural reasons for the extent of the proposed works which are deemed excessive. The trees within this area contribute materially to the amenities of the locality, playing an important part in providing a sense of scale, maturity and textural diversity to the immediate vicinity. The trees provide the environmental benefits that are associated with large canopy trees as well as important screening between the adjacent properties and the railway line. \r\n\r\nA reduction inthe overhang of these trees without a sound arbopricultural reason will reduce the valuable amenity that these trees currently provide but may also restrict them from achieving far greater amenity if left to achieve their potential canopy size.\r\n\r\nLarge canopy trees exponentially provide greater environmental benefits than small trees.  The benefits, such as particulate and rain water interception are needed the most in heavily populated urban areas such as Islington.\r\n\r\nThe council may look favorably on lesser works such as crown thinning and crown lifting to the trees if a sound arboricultural reason is given for the works."
