    "REASON(S) FOR REFUSAL:\r\n\r\n1\tThe proposed removal would be detrimental to conservation area and the amenity and environmental benefits that the tree provides. The works have been refused for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1.\tLack of arboricultural justification/ evidence and lack of a full exploration of engineering solutions\r\n\r\n2.\tLoss of amenity and associated environmental benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tYour attention is drawn to any INFORMATIVES that may be listed below:\r\n\r\n1\tInformatives:\r\n\r\nLack of arboricultural justification/evidence and lack of a full exploration of engineering solutions to repair the wall and retain the tree. \r\n\r\nThe tree is in in apparent good health, form and vigor with no obvious irredeemable defects visible from a VTA inspection.  The evidence of alleged damage to the boundary walls and footpath within the application is small and there has been no attempt to explore the many engineering solutions that are available to retain healthy trees whilst repairing external structures such as boundary walls and paths\r\n.  \r\nThe council considers it is reasonable to refuse any further works which would be detrimental to the health and amenity of the trees. \r\n\r\n\r\nLoss of Amenity and Environmental benefits\r\n\r\nA site visit by the tree officer did not reveal any sound arboricultural reasons for the extent of the proposed works which are deemed excessive. The trees contribute materially to the amenities of the locality, playing an important part in providing a sense of scale, maturity and textural diversity to the conservation area. The trees provide the environmental benefits that are associated with large canopy trees. \r\n\r\nThe removal of the tree will reduce the valuable amenity that the remaining trees currently provide, and this is to be reduced further as the recommendation is a phased removal of all three trees.\r\n\r\nLarge canopy trees exponentially provide greater environmental benefits than small trees.  The benefits, such as particulate and rain water interception are needed the most in heavily populated urban areas such as Islington.\r\n\r\nThe council may look favorably on lesser works to the trees if a sound arboricultural reason is given for the works."
