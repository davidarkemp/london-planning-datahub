On receipt, the scheme did not comply with policy or guidance. The LPA had acted in a proactive manner offering suggested improvements to the scheme to secure compliance with policies and written guidance during a previous application which included the works proposed under this application and which were not adopted by the applicant during the application stage.\r\n\r\nThe LPA delivered the decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF.\r\n\r\nThe LPA invites the applicant to enter into a collaborative pre-planning application discussion process to assist in the preparation of a new planning application."
