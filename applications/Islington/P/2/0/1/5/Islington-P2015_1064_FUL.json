    "To assist applicants the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Council's website. \r\n\r\nA pre-planning application advice service is also offered and encouraged.\r\n\r\nNo pre-application discussions were entered into. On receipt, the scheme did not comply with policy or guidance. The proposal was an amendment to a scheme previously granted planning permission and, due to the minor nature of the proposal, there were no possible improvements to the scheme that may have been able to secure compliance with policies and written guidance which were not adopted by the applicant during the application stage.\r\n\r\nThe LPA delivered the decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF.\r\n\r\nThe LPA invites the applicant to enter into a collaborative pre-planning application discussion process to assist in the preparation of a new planning application."
