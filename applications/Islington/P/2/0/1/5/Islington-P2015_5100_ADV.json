    "The proposed advertisement sign by reason of its size, siting and method of illumination would result in additional street clutter and would have a harmful visual impact on the surrounding urban area, nearby Grade 2 listed Pentonville Prison. The proposed advertisement is also considered to have a detrimental impact on highways safety and movements in the vicinity of the site. The proposal would fail to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding urban area and as such, would be harmful to local amenity contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Adopted Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.3 &  DM2.6 of the Adopted Islington Development Management Policies (2013) and the Caledonian Plan SPD 2014."
