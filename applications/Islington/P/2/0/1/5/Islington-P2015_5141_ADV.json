    "The proposed advertisement sign by reason of its size, siting and method of illumination would result in additional street clutter and would have a harmful impact on the setting in front of the Grade II Listed Finsbury Square and adjoining listed buildings. The proposal would fail to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the Bunhill Fields and Finsbury Square Conservation Area and as such, would be harmful to local amenity contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Adopted Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.3 and DM2.6 of the Adopted Islington Development Management Policies (2013) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
