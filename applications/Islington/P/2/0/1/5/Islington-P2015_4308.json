  "description": "For the purposes of this application, the proposal comprises of a modest refurbishment to the lower ground floor kitchen and dining area. It is proposed to remove the structural dividing wall between the two spaces to allow light to penetrate from front to back, and to meet the needs of modern family living. New steels will be concealed within the ceiling void. It is proposed to retain a small nib wall in order to express the original structure and provide a setting out point for kitchen units and storage. The kitchen door will be rotated ninety degrees to suit the new arrangement. It is proposed to redecorate in a style sympathetic to the building, retaining original features and materials wherever possible. The proposal will have no impact on the external facade at either the front or rear, nor on the other levels of the property. Listed Building consent application P2015/4399  also submitted.",
