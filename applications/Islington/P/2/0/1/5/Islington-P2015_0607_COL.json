The change of use of part of the second floor to Class C3 residential use therefore does not benefit from planning permission under Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (as amended) and the use as 21 residential units (Class C3) has not been established under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended in section 171B."
