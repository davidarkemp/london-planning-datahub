    "REASON: The proposed works to create a roof terrace and associated works at second floor level by virtue of their harm to the retained fabric and unsympathetic design, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and surrounding conservation area. The works would, therefore, cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to policy 12 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), policy 7.8 (sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan (2015), policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 (Design) and DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013), and Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
