    "The proposed introduction of an additional 18 hotel bedrooms compared to the previous s73 application and an additional 25 bedrooms compared to the original grant of planning permission has been accompanied by no supporting statements setting out why this change is sought, nor justifying the removal of the ancillary facilities at basement levels. The proposed increase would amount to an 18.5% increase from the original consent and a 12.7% increase from the previous s73 application. This amendment is not considered to be a minor change to the original permission and, given that the site is not in a location where a hotel is supported, this intensification is not minor, and is not supported due to being contrary to policy. The site is not located within a City Fringe Opportunity Area, nor is the site within proximity of Farringdon Station and therefore policy BC8H of the Finsbury Local Plan (2013) is not met. Furthermore, the proposal fails to deliver 10% wheelchair accessible rooms, and fails to demonstrate how impacts on residential amenity would be mitigated, nor how public access to ancillary facilities would be secured, contrary to policies DM2.1, DM2.2 and DM4.11 of the Development Management Policies (2013)."
