    "REASON: The proposed bike storage at the front of the property, by virtue of its prominent location, size, materials and detailed design, would be an alien addition to the listed building and its setting and would disrupt the front railings and would fail to preserve the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and its wider urban setting. The development would form a discordant and harmful feature when viewed from the surrounding public realm.  It would be contrary to policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 & 2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework and guidance in Historic England's Making Changes to Heritage Assets."
