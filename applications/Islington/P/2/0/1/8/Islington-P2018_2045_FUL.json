    "REASON: The proposed development would introduce further built form and massing to the backland site which is characterised by the existing mews dwellings interspersed with open spaces and gardens which lessen visual bulk and create an open feel. Given its large footprint, the proposed dwelling would become a dominant and excessive feature representing the over-development of the garden site which would be unacceptable in visual and land use terms. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Stratagey, policies DM2.1 and DM6.3E of the Development Management Policies, and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
