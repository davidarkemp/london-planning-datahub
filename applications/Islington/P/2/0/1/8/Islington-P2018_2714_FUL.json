    "The proposal would result in the unjustified loss of retail floorspace which provides an essential service to the local community thereby leading to an inadequate provision of Class A1 retail in the Local Shopping Area designation.  Insuffiicent information has been submitted withe the application to demonstrate that there is no demand for the existing retail use (demonstrating that the site as been vanact and actively marketed for the past two years). It would therefore be contrary to  CS14 (Retail and Services) of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM4.1 (Maintaining and promoting small and independent shops) and DM4.6 (Local Shopping Area) of the Development Management Policies 2013."
