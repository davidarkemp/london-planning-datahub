    "REASON: The proposal by reason of its detailed design, fenestration patterns, thickness of window frames and transoms would result in discordant and unsympathetic detailing, demonstrates poor design which is detrimental to the visual appearance and character of the host building, street scene and the wider Rosebery Avenue Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policy DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM4.8 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017), and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
