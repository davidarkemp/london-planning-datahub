    "*ARCHAEOLOGICAL & HISTORIC BUILDING RECORDING - HISTORIC ENGLAND:  No works (including demolition works) shall take place on site unless and until the applicant has undertaken a programme of building recording and historic analysis, which considers building structure, architectural detail and archaeological evidence. This shall be undertaken in accordance with a written scheme of investigation submitted by the applicant and approved by the Local Planning Authority.\r\n\r\nREASON:  Built heritage assets of archaeological interest may survive on the site. The Local Planning Authority (in conjunction with Historic England) wishes to secure the provision of archaeological recording of the historic structures prior to development.\r\n\r\nThe archaeological details and/or design that are addressed by this condition relate to works that would take place either prior to any demolition commencing or at the beginning of the construction phase, and/or the details would affect the subsequent design of other critical elements of the scheme. Therefore, these details are required to be agreed prior to commencement of the development."
