    "The proposed infill extension along the side of the property would have a negative impact on the character and appearance of the existing building due to its alignment with the main front wall of the building thereby failing to appear subordinate to the host building in visual terms. As such it would fail to preserve nor would it enhance the character and appearance of St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area which seeks to restrict enlarged side extensions along this section of Crane Grove. As such it would be contrary to Islington's Core Strategy Policies CS8 and CS9 and Islington's Development Management Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3, as well as to the Urban Design Guide (2017) and the St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
