Reason: This tree is growing within fairly close proximity to the house, is within 10.00m and is\r\ncausing obvious damage to the boundary wall.\r\n(T2) Birch: Small hybrid tree. Approximately 3.00m. Remove dead wood and reduce crown by 15% as general maintenance.\r\n(T3) Cherry: Approximately 8.00m. Reduce crown by 20-25%, thin crown density by 20% and remove dead wood as general maintenance.\r\n(T4) Hazel: Approximately 7.00m. Reduce crown by 20% and thin crown density by 20% as general maintenance.\r\n(T5) Apple: Approximately 3.00m. Reduce crown back to previous reduction points whilst preserving suitable fruiting spurs to ensure an apple crop as general\r\nmaintenance.\r\n(T6) Birch: Approximately 8.00m. Thin crown density by 20% and remove dead wood as general maintenance.",
