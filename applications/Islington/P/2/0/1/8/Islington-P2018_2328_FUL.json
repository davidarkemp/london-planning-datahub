    "REASON: The proposed resubmitted application for change of use would result in the loss of B1 business floorspace and in the absence of robust evidence, to justify its loss or demonstrate a lack of demand of business floorspace in this designated Town Centre Area, the proposed change of use would have a detrimental impact on the areas primary business role.  In addition no exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated that there is no demand for the floorspace being used for business purposes.  As such the proposed change of use is considered to be contrary to policy DM5.2 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013)."
