    "Reason: The proposed mansard roof extension and associated party walls, by virtue of its excessive design, scale, prominence and massing would form a discordant and dominant addition to the host property and wider unaltered terrace roofline. The proposal would form a visually harmful feature when seen from both short and long views from both the public and private realm to the front and rear of the site exerting a harmful visual impact on the host building and surrounding conservation area setting.  The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies  DM2.1 & 2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017 & the updated NPPF 2018."
