    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, scale, bulk, massing, height and overall form would create a dominant and discordant addition to the host building and would be readily visible from short and longer views from both the public and private realms. The excessive dominance would have a clear adverse visual impact and would harm the setting and character and appearance of the adjacent conservation areas. The proposal is therefore unacceptable and contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016); policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), guidance within Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017), Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) & the Updated NPPF 2018."
