    "Reason: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, scale, massing, bulk and prominent siting would form a dominant and discordant feature when seen from the both the public and private realm. The development would strike a discordant feature within the terrace of predominately unaltered rear rooflines. The proposal would detract from the character and appearance of the application property, the wider terrace and the conservation area and would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The proposal is contrary to the NPPF 2018, London Plan (2015) policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8, policy CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the guidance within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and Conservation Area Design Guide 2002."
