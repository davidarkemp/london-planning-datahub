It would cause harm to the character and appearance of the Newington Green Conservation Area and wider urban setting. The development is therefore contrary to Chapter 16 of the NPPF 2018, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the Urban Design Guide 2017."
