    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design, massing and siting, would represent an incongruous form of development, which would depart from the local vernacular and grain of development, and would diminish the visual amenity of the locality. The bulk, height and location of the building would appear overbearing and harmful to the visual cohesion of the streetscene in the context of the terrace, associated garages and to the residential amenity of neighbouring properties. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 134 of policy 12 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
