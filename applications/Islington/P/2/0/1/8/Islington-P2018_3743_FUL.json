    "REASON: Due to its excessive height, bulk, and massing, together with its inappropriate design, external appearance and visibility from the public realm, the proposed roof extension would disrupt the existing rhythm and consistency of the roof form of the semi-detached properties along this section of Mildmay Park and appear as an incongruous addition that fails to respect the character and appearance of the host building, the streetscene and the Newington Green Conservation Area. Consequently, the proposal would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host building, the streetscene and the surrounding conservation area and the proposal is contrary to 7.4 (Local character), and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), the Newington Green Conservation Area Statement (2014) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
