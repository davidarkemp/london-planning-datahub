    "The proposed roof extension would by reason of its overall design would detract from the character of the Duncan Terrace and Colebrook Row Conservation Area. It results in an increase in width of an existing side facing box dormer across the valley roof with a glazed addition and as such fails to preserve the character or appearance of the uniform existing terrace and nor enhance its setting within the conservation area. The proposals are therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013. It also contravenes the guidance within the Duncan Terrace/Colebrook Row Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Urban Design Guide 2017."
