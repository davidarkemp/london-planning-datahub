    "1\tIt is noted that documents submitted as part of the application sought to justify the installation of the proposed InLink structure by linking it with the removal of 2no. phone boxes elsewhere in the Borough. In this instance, the location of the phone boxes to be removed were not within close proximity to the site of the proposed InLink structure. Therefore, the Council considered that the weight to be attributed to this a material planning consideration in the assessment of the application was limited as it would fail to mitigate street clutter in the immediate vicinity of the proposed location and therefore fail to produce a de-cluttering benefit, or at the very least a zero net increase (setting aside assessment of prominence, digital nature and height).\r\n\r\nIf the mitigation was felt to have been effective, then a S106 agreement to secure the removal of the identified  phone boxes prior to first installation of the BT link unit would be required and in the absence of such a document in the event of appeal, this would be expected to secure the \"mitigation\"."
