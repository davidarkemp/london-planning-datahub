The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 6.10, 7.4, 7.5 for the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.6 of the Development Management Policies (2013), The Islington Urban Design Guide (2017), The Islington Streetbook SPD (2017) and the emerging draft London Plan Policies T2 and D7."
