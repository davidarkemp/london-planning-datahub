    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its design, scale, footprint and location is excessive and leads to a development out of scale and character with the existing pattern and rhythm of form that the rear of this terrace currently express.  The proposal would not be sufficiently set away from boundaries and could in time result in cumulative impact or a 'terracing' effect arising from similar built form to the end of adjoining gardens.  This would have a detrimental effect on the appearance of the public realm at the rear of the site fronting Rickthorne Road.  This proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (February 2011), Policy DM2.1 (Design) of the Development Management Policies (June 2013) and the Islington Urban Design Supplementary Planning Document (January 2017)."
