    "REASON: The proposed two story side addition and full width dormer extension, by reason of their inappropriate design, scale, bulk, mass and overall scale, would constitute as an discordant and dominant form of development that fails to remain subservient to the main building while eroding the distinctive openness of the intersection. The proposal would be readily visible from the surrounding public and private realm and would form a detrimental feature within its surrounding context.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not be consistent with policy DM2.1 of the Islington's Development Management Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan and the advice contained within by the Islington's Urban Design Guide 2016."
