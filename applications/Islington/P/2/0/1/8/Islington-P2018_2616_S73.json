    "REASON: The proposed alterations would result in a roof extension of unacceptable excessive bulk and depth, which would not align with neighbouring roof extensions and would be an incongruous and overly dominant addition. It would fail to preserve and enhance the character of the host building and, due to increased visibility towards the front of the extension from public sightlines along Liverpool Road, would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the wider Barnsbury Conservation Area. The proposed amendments are therefore contrary to policy 12 of the NPPF 2012; policies 7.6 and 7.8 if the London Plan 2016; policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011; policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013; the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines; and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
