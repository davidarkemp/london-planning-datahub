    "REASON: The proposed rear extension and internal alterations to the listed buildings plan form by reason of its excessive detailed design, scale, massing, bulk and form would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host property and wider terrace setting.  The internal works would undermine and harm the architectural integrity and historic plan form unacceptably. The works would, therefore cause clear visual harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 195 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM 2.1 &  DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017 and the updated NPPF 2018."
