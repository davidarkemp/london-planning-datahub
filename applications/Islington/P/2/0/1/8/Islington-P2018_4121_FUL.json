    "REASON: The proposed roof extension and its overall design, scale, massing and prominent siting would form a dominant and discordant feature when seen from the private realm. The proposal would have a detrimental visual impact while disrupting the rear roof form of the host property, wider terrace and surrounding Whitehall Park Conservation area. The proposals are therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan, policies CS8, NPPF 2018, CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013. It also contravenes the guidance within the Whitehall Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Urban Design Guide 2017."
