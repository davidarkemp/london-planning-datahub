    "The principle of the roof extension and its overall design would detract from the character of the St Johns Grove Conservation area. It results in the loss of the original rear roof slope and fails to preserve the character or appearance of the existing terrace nor enhance its setting within the conservation area. In addition, the creation of a front lightwell would result in the loss of an original front garden and an increase in hard stand to the detriment of the host property and surrounding conservation area. The proposals are therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013. It also contravenes the guidance within the St John's Grove Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Urban Design Guide 2017"
