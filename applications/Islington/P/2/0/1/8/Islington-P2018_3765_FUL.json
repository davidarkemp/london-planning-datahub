    "REASON: The proposed contemporary glazed balustrade due to its design, materials and appearance represent visual clutter and an incongruous form of development which would be harmful to the architectural character of the host building.  In addition, the proposed inappropriate glazed balustrade positioned at a high level in a prominent location would be visually discordant features which would impact on the harmony of the Victorian terrace thus undermining the integrity of the terrace and impact on the surrounding townscape and the adjoining Tufnell Park Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore contravene the NPPF (2018), policies CS8 & CS9 of the Core Strategy (2012); policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the requirements of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
