    "The proposed change of use to restaurant/cafe use (Class A3) is in contrary with Condition C.2 (1) (f) (i), Class C, Part 3, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). There is not insufficient marketing evidence provided to demonstrate that the site has been vacant and actively marketed for the past two years. The proposal would result in the unjustified loss of retail floorspace which provides an essential service to the local community thereby leading to an inadequate provision of Class A1 retail in the immediate area. It would therefore be contrary to  CS14 (Retail and Services) of the Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM4.7 (Dispersed Shops) of the Development Management Policies 2013."
