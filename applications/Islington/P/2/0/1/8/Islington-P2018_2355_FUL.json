    "The significant increase in floorspace of open B1 use, designed and suitable for B1a offices, is inconsistent with the primary economic function of the LSIS, as identified in Policy DM5.3, and compromises the scope for future intensification of industrial uses (B1c,B2,B8). The proposed open B1 floorspace does not complement or support the economic and employment role of the LSIS. \r\nThe application is therefore contrary to the objectives of Policy DM 5.3, and para 5.22 of the Council's Development Management Policies and Policy 4.4 of the London Plan. Further, implementation guidance point of SPG3 of the Mayor of London's Supplementary Planning Guidance \"Land for Industry and Transport\" emphasises the importance of timely reviews to inform the retention of industrial land. Islington's Employment Land Study (ELS) (2016) highlights the large losses of industrial land in recent years. Similarly, the recent GLA Industrial Land baseline data demonstrates that the borough's stock of industrial land fell from 60ha in 2010 to just 35ha in 2015.\r\nThe need to ensure that the land within the LSIS remains predominantly in industrial use is therefore an important material consideration. This position is reflected in a) the draft new London Plan, Policy E6 of which requires the LSIS to be focused on \"industrial and related uses\" and b) Policies SP3, B1 (including para 4.13 of the supporting text), and B2 of the Council's emerging Local Plan which permit the development of office use as part of a hybrid workspace but only where this constitutes a small proportion of the overall gross space proposed. The application is contrary to the Mayor's SPG, London Plan Policy E6, and policies SP3, B1 and B2 in Islington's draft Local Plan."
