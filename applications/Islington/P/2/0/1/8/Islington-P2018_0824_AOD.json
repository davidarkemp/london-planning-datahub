    "You are reminded that the Arboricultural Method Statement states that\r\n-  a meeting will take place between the site manager/main contractor and consulting arboriculturist prior to construction work commencing;\r\n- protective measures must be in place prio to any ground or construction work taking place; \r\n- All approved tree work and tree felling will be carried out prior to the commencement of any demolition and construction works on site;\r\n- Remaining trees will be protected by forming Construction Exclusion Zones (CEZ) as shown on Appendix 4 the Tree Protection Plan (TPP); \r\n-  The arborist will complete regular site visits to check that the tree protection measures are being carried out. The frequency of the visits will be dictated by the level of activity and degree to which the tree protection measures are being respected. A note of the date of each visit and a summary of the findings will be forwarded to both the Tree Officer and the Main Contractor to provide an audit trail enabling the proper implementation of the tree protection measures to be checked and verified.\r\n-  There are six key stages where on-site arboricultural advice will be needed   Prior to commencement, to review the contents of the AMS, and deal with any queries the main contractor may have.   To confirm which trees require removal and tree work.   To confirm that the protective fencing (and ground protection, if required) is in place prior to each phase of construction.   To supervise the careful removal of surfaces within the RPA of retained trees.   To supervise pre-emptive root pruning.   To supervise installation of No-Dig surfaces where necessary within RPA of retained trees"
