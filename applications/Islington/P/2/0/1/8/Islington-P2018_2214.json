  "description": "Rear Garden: Holly: Approximately 5.00m. This tree located on the rear boundary. Reduce height by 40%, reduce lateral and sub lateral growth by 20% whilst maintain good screen. 2 x Thuja: Approximately 5.00m. These trees have been pruned to a uniform height in the past. As a continuation of this management.; reduce back to previous reduction points, lightly reduce lateral and sub lateral growth by 20%. Hawthorn: Approximately 4.00m. This tree is tucked away in the corner of the garden. Crown reduction will increase light levels to the seating area. Reduce crown by approximately 40% back to previous reduction points and re-shape. Apple: Approximately 5.00m. This fruit tree is a key feature of the garden. It casts heavy shade over the perineal beds underneath. Reduce crown by 20% and thin crown density by 20%. Reasons: maintenance pruning to increase light levels and help maintain trees at reasonable dimensions for their locations.",
