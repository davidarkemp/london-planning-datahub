    "REASON: The proposed roof terrace associated metal railing balustrade and timber trellis screen, due to design, appearance and position above a three storey outrigger represent visual clutter and an incongruous form of development which would be harmful to the architectural character of the host building.  In addition, the roof terrace railings and timber trellis screen positioned at a high level would be visually discordant features which would impact on the rhythm and uniformity of the Victorian terrace thus undermining the integrity of the terrace and impact on the surrounding townscape.  The proposal would therefore contravene the NPPF (2018), policies CS8 & CS9 of the Core Strategy (2012); policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the requirements of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
