    "REASON: The new shopfront, by reason of its highly incongruous detail and design would not present as sympathetic to the host building which is detrimental to the visual appearance and character of the host building, street scene and the wider St John's Grove Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policy DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM4.8 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017), the Islington Shopfront Design Guide and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
