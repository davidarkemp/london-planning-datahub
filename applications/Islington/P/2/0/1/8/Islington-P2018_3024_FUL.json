    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate detailed design, scale, massing, bulk, height and overall roof form would form a dominant and discordant feature which would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host locally listed building, pair of semi-detached villas and the wider St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area setting. The development would dominate the host pair of semi-detached villas at second floor level and would erode the characteristic open and spacious space which characterises these type of properties at this level and would be readily visible from the public realm. It would therefore fail to comply with Islington Core Strategy 2011 policies CS8 and CS9 and Development Management Policies 2013 policies DM2.1, DM2.3, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017, St Mary Magdalene Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and the NPPF 2018."
