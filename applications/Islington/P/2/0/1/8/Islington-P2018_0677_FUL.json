    "REASON: Due to the unsympathetic design, appearance and positioning the proposed roof terrace, associated balustrade and access doors the development is considered to be harmful to the architectural character and appearance of the host building and to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed terrace and associated balustrade, would also result in visual clutter and would appear as incongruous additions that would undermine and erode the unity of the group of properties the application belongs to. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017), policy CS12 of the Core Strategy (2011) and policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013."
