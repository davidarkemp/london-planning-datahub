    "REASON: The proposed front dormer windows, which would be visible from the public and private realm, would form a dominant and discordant feature.  They would, by reason of their scale, size and poor design, be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and the wider Tufnell Park Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, and the advice within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
