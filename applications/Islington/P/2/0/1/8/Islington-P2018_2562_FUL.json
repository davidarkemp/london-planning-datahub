    "REASON: The proposed new five storey building to the rear of the site by reason of its excessive height, scale, massing, form, bulk and inappropriate and contrived detailed design, is considered to form a discordant and dominant form of development that would result in an incongruous backland addition that fails to appear subservient to and causes harm to the locally listed buildings at no's.30-31 and 32 Clerkenwell Green, and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area. In addition, the proposed first floor rear extension to no's.30-31 Clerkenwell Green due to its full width, excessive depth from the rear elevation and proximity to the proposed new five storey building further exacerbates the overly cramped and excessively dominant nature of the proposals which would appear unduly overbearing when seen within their context. The proposal is therefore unacceptable, contrary to Policies 7.4 & 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013) and the Urban Design Guide 2017, Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
