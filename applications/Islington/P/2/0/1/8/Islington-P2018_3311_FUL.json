    "REASON: The submitted marketing evidence fails to provide robust justification on the lack of demand for the A1 retail unit and fails to show that the proposed loss of A1 use would not have an adverse effect on the vitality, viability and predominantly retail function of the Local Shopping Area. The proposal which amalgamates the existing two units would also result in loss of a small and independent retail unit that conflicts with policy objective DM4.1. Furthermore, the proposal has submitted insufficient information to demonstrate that the resulting proportion of individual retail units would not fall below 35% of the total number of individual units within the designated Whitecross Street Local Shopping Area. The proposed development would therefore result in unacceptable loss of retail floor space within the designated Local Shopping Area, and would diminish the potential amount and range of local shopping services available to the local community. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policy CS14 (Retail and services) of the Core Strategy (2011) and policy DM4.1 (Maintaining and promoting small and independent shops), DM4.6 (Local Shopping Areas) of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), and policy BC8 (F) of the Finsbury Local Plan (2013)."
