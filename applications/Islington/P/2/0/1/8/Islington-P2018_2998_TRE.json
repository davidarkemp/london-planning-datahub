Grind out stump 200mm. We would like to replant the same species (Tilia platyphyllos) slightly further back, away from under the crown of the Beech tree.\r\nReasons for works - Tree retention is now inappropriate as tree has outgrown its location and is of low amenity value. It is growing into the crown of the adjacent Beech tree and unbalancing the crown. \r\n\r\nT3 (T9) Horse Chestnut - Reduce back to previous points of reduction retaining furnishing growth. Crown thin by 15%. Remove all dead branches over 40mm.\r\nReasons for works - complies with good arboricultural management and is consistent with previous tree management\r\n\r\nT4 (T10) Sycamore ) - Reduce back to most recent points of reduction (approx. 1-1.5m of regrowth) whilst retaining furnishing growth. Remove all dead wood over 40mm.\r\nReasons for works - Complies with good arboricultural management and is consistent with previous tree management. This tree is quite large but due to a poor early pollard is of low amenity value. To help maintain the health of the tree and enhance the visual amenity value.",
