    "Reason: The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing, height and siting is considered to form an incongruous and discordant feature when seen from the public and private realm. The proposal would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host property, the wider terrace and the conservation area. The proposed works are, therefore, contrary to Policy 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, policies 7.4 (Local character), 7.5 (Public realm), 7.6 (Architecture), 7.8 (Sustaining and Enhancing the Significance of Heritage Assets) of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, Conservation Area Design Guidelines paragraph 10.18 and the Urban Design Guide SPD 2017 sections 5.133-5.140."
