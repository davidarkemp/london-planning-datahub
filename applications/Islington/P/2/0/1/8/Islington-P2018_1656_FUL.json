It would form a discordant feature that would disrupt the rhythm and uniformity of an  unbroken roofline on an attractive Victorian residential terrace The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
