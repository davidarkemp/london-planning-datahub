    "Reason : 1 - REASON: The proposed rear extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, massing and detailed design including materials and fenestration, is a dominant and idscordant addition to the host building and terrace and harms the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area, which is not outweighed by sufficient public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D1, D4 and HC1 of London Plan (2021), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington Core Strategy Policies (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Development Management Policies (2013), and the design advice found within Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines.\r\n",
