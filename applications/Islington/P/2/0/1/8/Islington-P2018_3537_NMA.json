    "Condition 16 attached to planning consent P2017/2961/FUL should now read as:\r\n\r\nPrior to Commencement of Superstructure Works a Wind Impact Assessment and the detailed design of all wind mitigation measures will be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. These details shall include the size and appearance of any features, the size and appearance of any planting containers, trees species, planting medium and irrigation systems, and balcony and deck details. No part of the building shall be occupied until the approved wind mitigation measures have been implemented unless the Local Planning Authority agrees otherwise in writing. The said wind mitigation measures shall be retained in place for the life of the building unless otherwise agreed by the Local Planning Authority.\r\n\r\nREASON: In order to ensure that the proposed development does not have a detrimental impact on the amenities of the area.  These details are required prior to construction in order that any changes to satisfy this condition are incorporated into the development before the design is too advanced to make changes in accordance with London Plan Policy 7.6, City of London Local Plan policies DM10.1, DM16.1 and DM16.2 and Islington Local Plan policy DM2.1."
