Temporary obstructions during construction must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic.\r\n\r\nAll construction associated vehicles must only park/stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.\r\n\r\nNo skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time. \r\n\r\nIt is essential that construction activities do not lead to disruption to bus operations."
