The proposal would clearly have a detrimental visual impact on the character and appearance of the host property, wider terrace setting and surrounding Barnsbury Conservation Area contrary to policies Chapter 16 of the NPPF (2019) which seek to conserve and enhance the historic environment, policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 which seek to preserve and enhance the significance of heritage assets as well as the provisions of policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 which seek to protect and enhance Islington's built and historic environment and policies DM2.1 & DM 2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies which seeks to protect and enhance Islington's historic environment."
