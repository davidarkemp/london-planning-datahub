    "REASON: The proposed InLink advertisement structure by reason of its height, design, siting and prominent location within the Upper Street North Conservation Area and within the setting of the Grade I listed Union Chapel, would increase visual clutter and would harm the character and appearance of the streetscene, wider conservation area, and Grade I listed building. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 6.10, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1, DM2.3, DM2.6 and DM2.7 of the Development Management Policies 2013, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017, the Conservation Area Design Guidelines, and the Islington Streetbook Supplementary Planning Document (2012) and NPPG (advert regulations)."
