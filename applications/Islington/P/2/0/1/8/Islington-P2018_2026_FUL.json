    "The proposed mansard roof extension by reason of its design, size, scale, and siting would be an incongruous and unsympathetic feature that would harm the character and appearance of the terrace and wider conservation area. The extension would result in an undesirable visual feature when observed from the rear.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, CS7 and CS8 of the Core Strategy 2011, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the East Canonbury Conservation Area Guidelines."
