    "REASON: The proposed rear first rear extension and roof extension by virtue of their inappropriate design, scale, height, depth and massing are considered to form dominant and discordant features towards the rear of the property disrupting the rhythmic rear building line at rear first floor and roof level. These visually harmful additions would be readily visible form the private realm and would cause real visual harm when seen within the wider context of the host terrace and wider urban setting. It would therefore fail to comply with Islington Core Strategy 2011 policies CS8 and CS9 and Development Management Policies 2013 DM2.1, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017 & The NPPF."
