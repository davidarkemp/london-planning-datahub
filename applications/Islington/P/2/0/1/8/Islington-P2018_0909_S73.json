The proposed minor material amendments relate to changes to the floorplans to remove reference to Cadent/National Grid occupying office space on the upper floors, and to alter the condition wording to allow the ground floor parking and storage area to be used in association with Cadent/National Grid operations in office space on an adjoining site.  Additionally, there would be minor changes to glazing, and additional windows installed.  There is also a change to the trigger point for submission of bird/bat box information.",
