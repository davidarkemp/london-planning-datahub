    "REASON: The submitted Structural Method Statement (SMS) for the hereby proposed development fails to adequately consider the impacts of the tree roots of the tree to the front of the property. The SMS fails to provide a 'design stage structural drawings' that reflects the actual conditions of the adjoining sites (fails to identify the adjoining basement level next door in the design details) and fails to appropriately address other requirements of the Basement Development SPD (2016). In this regard, the development fails to appropriately consider the risks the proposal may have upon property, infrastructure and the public as set out in Planning Practice Guidance in relation to structural stability and fails to accord therefore with policies CS9, CS10 and CS15 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1, DM2.3, DM6.5, DM7.1 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013) and the Basement Development SPD (2016)."
