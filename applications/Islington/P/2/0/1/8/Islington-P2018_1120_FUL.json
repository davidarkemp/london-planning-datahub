    "REASON: The proposed Inlink advertisement structure by reason of its proposed siting on a public pavement area with significant public domain works currently being undertaken, would compromise the provision of pedestrian access and streetscape improvements, to the detriment of users of the public realm. The proposed Inlink would affect pedestrian flows and access on the eastern side of Holloway Road and would therefore be contrary to policies 6.10 and 7.5 of the London Plan 2016 and policy DM8.2 of the Development Management Policies 2013"
