    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its excessive height, depth and footprint would lead to a development out of scale and character with the existing pattern in the immediate area. It would also contribute to a significant loss of private garden area and be harmful to the character of the area. This proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (February 2011), Policy DM2.1 (Design) of the Development Management Policies (June 2013) and the Islington Urban Design Supplementary Planning Document (January 2017)."
