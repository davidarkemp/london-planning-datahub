    "REASON: The proposed two tiered roof terrace and associated balustrades at second floor level is by virtue of its inappropriate design, scale and siting is considered inappropriate and out of keeping with the predominant character of the terrace row and surrounding area. It would lead to a discordant addition and visual clutter and represent a harmful visual addition to the host building when seen from the public and private realm. The proposal would fail to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the Canonbury Conservation Area. The proposal would be contrary to Islington's Development Management Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 (2013), Policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011) and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
