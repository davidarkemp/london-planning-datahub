    "Reason: The proposed alterations to the rear window, associated Juliette balcony and use of the flat roof area as a roof terrace by reason of its design, prominent siting, scale and projection would form a dominant and discordant feature that would harm the character and appearance of the Grade II Listed Building and wider conservation area being readily visible from the surrounding public and private realm. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, CS7 and CS8 of the Core Strategy 2011, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, the Urban Design Guide 2017 and New River Conservation Area Guidelines."
