The proposed structure would therefore be contrary to policy 6.10 of the London Plan (2016), policies DM8.1, DM8.2 and DM8.4 of the Development Management Policies (2013), the Islington Streetbook Supplementary Planning Document (2012), Transport for London Streetscape Guidance Third Edition (2017 Revision 1) and emerging draft London Plan Policy T2."
