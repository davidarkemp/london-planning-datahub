    "Reason 1: The proposed studio unit at basement level flat would create a residential unit which is in low demand and no exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated to justify its provision. The proposed unit would clearly fail to achieve a satisfactory standard of residential amenity by virtue of its compromised and poor outlook, single aspect nature and inadequate levels of sunlight and daylight. The proposed residential unit is therefore substandard and contrary to the provisions of London Plan(2016) Policy 3.5, Policy CS12 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and Policy DM3.4 of the Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and the Updated NPPF 2018."
