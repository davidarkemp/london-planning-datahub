    "REASON: The proposed roof alteration by reason of its design, scale, massing, bulk and appearance would form a dominant and discordant feature which would be visible from both the public and private realm. The proposed development would neither preserve or enhance the appearance of the host property or the wider terrace setting which remains unaltered at roof level.  The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, DM2.1 of Islington's Development Management Policies, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan and the NPPF."
