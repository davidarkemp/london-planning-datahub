    "REASON: Taken together, the proposed alterations to the roof including the provision of a pitched roof and a dormer to the rear roofslope, are considered to form a dominant and discordant feature which would severely interrupt the existing largely unaltered roofline of the host terrace group, and that of the adjoining group of properties. As such, the proposal would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace setting and the surrounding urban area. The proposed development is considered to be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS8 of the Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017 and the NPPF."
