    "The proposal would fail to maximise the site's employment use; would not provide flexibly designed and adequately serviced floorspace to accommodate an appropriate mix of uses as expected within an Employment Growth Area; and would fail to provide affordable workspace to meet local needs.  The proposal would thus cause unacceptable and unsustainable harm to the borough's supply of land to meet future sustainable economic development and innovation needs contrary to the NPPF (2012); London Plan (MALP) 2016 Policies 2.9 and 4.4; Islington Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS13; Islington Development Management Policies (2013) DM5.1, DM5.2; DM5.4 and DM8.6, and the London Plan SPG Land for Industry and Transport (September 2012)."
