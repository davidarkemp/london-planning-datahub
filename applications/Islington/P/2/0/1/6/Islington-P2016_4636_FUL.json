    "REASON: The proposed roof terrace, balustrades and associated structures would form a discordant addition and result in visual clutter on a clean roof profile, resulting in a harmful impact on a simplistic yet clean roof form, visible from the public and private realm in the surrounding area, in a highly prominent location.  As such, the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building, adjoining terrace and its surrounding area. The development is therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016); policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policy DM2.1 of the Islington's Development Policies (2013) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
