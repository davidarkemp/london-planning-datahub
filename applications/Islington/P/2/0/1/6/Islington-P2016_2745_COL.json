    "REASON: The Local Planning Authority is not satisfied, on the basis of the evidence submitted, that it has been adequately established that the unit known as Flat 5, 73 White Lion Street, Islington, N1 9PF, has been operating as a self-contained residential flat (Use Class C3) for a continuous period of 4 years prior to the date of this application and so cannot be established under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended in section 171(b) (1). Furthermore, the host building is subject to an enforcement notice relating to the material change of use of the first, second and third floors as three self-contained flats. This means that the host building is not eligible for this type of application."
