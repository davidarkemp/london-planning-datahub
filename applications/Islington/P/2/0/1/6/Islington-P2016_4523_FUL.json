    "REASON: The proposed rear roof extension by reason of its excessive design, scale massing and bulk located on an unbroken rear roofline would form a dominant and discordant feature when seen from the conservation area and the surrounding private realm. The development would fail to form a harmonious and subservient addition to the dwellings and wider terrace roofslope and would harm the character and appearance of the surrounding conservation area contrary to policy 9 of Islington's Core Strategy, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies, the Tollington Park Conservation Area Design Guideline and Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2006."
