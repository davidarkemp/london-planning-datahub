The proposed advertisement is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM 2.1, DM2.3 and DM2.6 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), and policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015) and the guidance of the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
