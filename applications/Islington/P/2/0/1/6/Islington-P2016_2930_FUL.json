    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its excessive and inappropriate design, scale, massing, bulk and footprint is considered to form a dominant and discordant form of development in this backland site location. The proposal would have a clear detrimental impact on the surrounding private realm and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Tollington Park Conservation Area, and the existing locally listed terrace. The proposal is therefore unacceptable, contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), Tollington Park Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines (2006)."
