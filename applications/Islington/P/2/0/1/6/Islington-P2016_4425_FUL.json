    "REASON: The proposed development, by reason of its inappropriate height, scale, bulk, massing, and poor standard of detailed design, appearance and materials, would be contextually incongruous, and fail to respect and respond positively to the streetscape and the wider context. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) Chapter 12 (Achieving well-designed places), London Plan (2016) policies 7.4 (Local character) and 7.6 (Architecture), Draft London Plan (December 2019) Policies Policy D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and D4 (Delivering good design), Islington Core Strategy (2011) policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's character) and CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) and Islington Development Management Policies (2013) policy DM2.1 (Design) and guidance contained with the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
