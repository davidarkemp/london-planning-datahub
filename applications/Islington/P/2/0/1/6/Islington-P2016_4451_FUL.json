    "REASON: The proposed part single storey part three storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive design, scale, height, bulk and massing would fail to be subordinate to the main building and would form an overdominant and harmful visual feature. The proposed development would be readily visible from both the public and private realm  and would therefore be harmful to the integrity of the terrace, the character and appearance of the locally listed host building and the character and appearance of the Arlington Square Conservation Area, contrary to and the NPPF (2012), policy CS9 of the Islington Square Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and supplementary guidance provided in the Arlington Square Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and in particular paragraph 4.12, and Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
