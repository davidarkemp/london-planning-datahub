    "REASON: By virtue of the height, depth and massing, the proposed rear extension would have an unacceptably harmful impact on the residential amenities of the adjoining property at no. 45 Petherton Road due to the unacceptable harm to their levels of daylight and sunlight, loss of outlook and creation of undue sense of enclosure. Therefore the proposal would result in unacceptable harm to the amenities and living conditions of those occupiers contrary to the NPPF (2012); policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011) and policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013)."
