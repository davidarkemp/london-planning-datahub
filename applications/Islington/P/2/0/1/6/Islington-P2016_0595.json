  "description": "The proposal is to refit an existing retail unit to Sofa.com specification. The architectural and industrial feel is on brand for Sofa.com therefore minimal works will be carried out to alter the internal space. The existing level entrances are to be retained. On the ground floor the existing glazed bricks to the walls, and parquet to the floor are to be retained. A number of free-standing units from the previous shopfit are to be retained but relocated. There will be no mechanical fixings to the historic fabric of the building. New signage and flags to Sofa.com specification is proposed to the exterior of the building a separate application has been submitted for approval of the advertisements.",
