    "CIL Informative:  Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), this development is liable to pay the London Borough of Islington Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). These charges will be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Islington CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. One of the development parties must now assume liability to pay CIL by submitting an Assumption of Liability Notice to the Council at cil@islington.gov.uk. The Council will then issue a Liability Notice setting out the amount of CIL payable on commencement of the development.  \r\n\r\nFailure to submit a valid Assumption of Liability Notice and Commencement Notice prior to commencement of the development may result in surcharges being imposed and the development will not benefit from the 60 day payment window. \r\n\r\nFurther information and all CIL forms are available on the Planning Portal at www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil and the Islington Council website at www.islington.gov.uk/cilinfo. Guidance on the Community Infrastructure Levy can be found on the National Planning Practice Guidance website at http://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/blog/guidance/community-infrastructure-levy/."
