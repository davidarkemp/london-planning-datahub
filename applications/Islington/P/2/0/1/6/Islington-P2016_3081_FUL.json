    "REASON: The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its overall inappropriate height, design, bulk, scale, depth, massing and non-contextual use of materials would form a dominant, discordant and visually harmful addition to the host building.  The proposed development would fail to be a subservient and harmonious addition to the host property and pair of villas, and would form a detrimental feature when seen from the surrounding public and private realm failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding conservation area. The proposal would fail to comply with policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Polices (2013), Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and Highbury New Park Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
