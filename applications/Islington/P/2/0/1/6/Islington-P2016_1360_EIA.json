The development, whilst falling into Schedule 2's 'Description of Development 10 (f) (Infrastructure projects), 'Construction of roads' and exceeding the thresholds listed in column 2, is not within a sensitive area as defined in Part 1 Regulation 2 (1) of the Regulations and would not have significant effects on the local environment to the extent that it would necessitate the submission of an ES. This conclusion is without prejudice to the Council's assessment of any future planning application against the Development Plan."
