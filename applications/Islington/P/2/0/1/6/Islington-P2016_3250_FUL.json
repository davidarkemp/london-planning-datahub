    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate scale and bulk, design and fenestration, would result in an over dominant and discordant addition, harming the symmetry of the pair with the adjoining villa at no. 3 and harm the visual integrity shared with the adjacent pairs of villas. As such, the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the building and its surrounding conservation area. The development is therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2015); policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington's Development Policies (2013); and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Hillmarton Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
