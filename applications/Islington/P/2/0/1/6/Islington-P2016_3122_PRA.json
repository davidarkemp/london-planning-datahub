    "REASON: In accordance with The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and specifically the provisions of Class O and paragraph W, the Local Planning Authority refuses this application as in its opinion, the applicant has provided insufficient precise and unambiguous information to enable the Local Planning Authority to confirm that the proposed development complies with restriction O.1(b) which requires that the use of the first , second and third floors (that are the subject of this application) was as B1(a) offices on or before 30 May 2013. Based on the information provided the Local Planning Authority considers that on the balance of probabilities the lawful use of the first, second and third floors on or before 30 May 2013 was not as a B1(a) office."
