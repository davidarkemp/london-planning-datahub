    "The principle of this temporary diversion could be acceptable, subject to there being no loss of parking bays on the diverted route and the turning manoeuvres can be managed safely.  The temporary diversion route appears to include physical works to the highways that are within Islington (and require highways approval) that could result in the loss of existing parking spaces, block traffic and impact other bus routes and do not appear to have our approval (such as a new bus stand on Barking Street and the lengthening of the westbound stop cage). The information submitted with the planning application also appears to test a double decker bus on the temporary diversion route and the 812 is currently served by a single decker 'Bluebird Tucana'.  \r\n\r\nThere are proposed signalised junction improvements at Barring St and New North Road that could be negatively affected if the temporary diversion route were to become permanent."
