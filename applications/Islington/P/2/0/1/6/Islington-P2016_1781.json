  "description": "The proposals have been carefully designed in order to adhere to all proposed larger permitted development standards, whilst also using a material palette selected to match the original house. Works to the ground floor include the creation of a new shower room designed to be in a locaiton set away from the kitchen, a new living and dining space overlooking the rear garden and a new ktiche/breakfast area. The living spaces are situated within the proposed rear extension. The rear extension has a ridge height of 3.97m and an eaves height of 3.00m. The extension projects 5.87m beyond the rear elevation, below the permitted 6m for a terraced house. The rear extension will be finished with yellow stock brick, slate tiles and high performance windows. As part of the renovation of the house, Mr Miltiadou would like to follow the example of properties nearby by adding a new bedroom with en suite facilities into the currently unused loft space. THe design of the loft complies with all permitted development standards. The cubic volume of the loft space is currently 42.1 m3, the proposed volume is 56.0m3, an increase of 13.9m3. The proposed dormer will also not be at a height taller than the existing roof ridge or project beyond the roof edge. The dormer will be highly insulated and clad with slate tiles, finished with high performance glazing. As part of the renovation works, Mr Miltiadou has already installed high quality sash windows to the front of the property.",
