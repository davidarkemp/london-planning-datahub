Ensure a 2m clearance of sub lateral growth from building.\r\n \r\nT2 Ash Reduce top height only to no further than most previous points of crown reduction whilst leaving furnishing growth on all points, no stubs to be left. \r\nThe two lowest branches to the south (across the front of no.13 Huddleston Road) and west (across the rear of number 30 Anson Road) aspects crown reduce by approximately 1m below previous pruning points to strong lateral growth. \r\nThe remaining branch to the East (towards number 32 Anson Road on the opposite side of the road ) crown reduce by 0.5 to 1m below previous points of reduction to strong lateral growth to leave a slightly more compact crown than before. Ensure a 2m max clearance of sub-lateral branches from building (no removal of large limbs).",
