    "- The applicant has submitted views from the Arlington Square Conservation Area and has stated that the views would be improved as the scheme will \"present a coherent high quality, large scale development on the southern canal bank\" which \"fits in with the emerging Colville Masterplan developments\", \"collates the site in with the existing large scale development\" and that the building \"will present a lesser scale, height and massing compared to the approved residential development beyond\".\r\n\r\n- It is acknowledged that the Colville Estate towers are visible in views from the Conservation Area; however the application site is in the foreground of the towers in views from LB Islington.  The previously approved building at 8 storeys would sit comfortably in these views in the context of the heights to the adjacent perimeter block.  An increase in height of 3 storeys would effectively bring taller buildings closer to the Conservation Area and the building would be much more dominant and prominent in these views.  \r\n\r\n- The LB Islington therefore object to the application as the increased height would not preserve or enhance the Arlington Square Conservation Area."
