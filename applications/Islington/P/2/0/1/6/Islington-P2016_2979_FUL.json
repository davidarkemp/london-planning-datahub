    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing and overall appearance would form a dominant and discordant form of development harmful to the character and appearance of the locally listed Victorian terrace building, terrace setting and wider conservation area setting. In addition, the proposed roof extension would interrupt an unbroken roofline detrimental to the rhythm, uniformity and integrity of the host terrace when viewed from the private realm.  The proposal would therefore fail to preserve the character and appearance of the wider Upper Street (North) Conservation Area and would fail to accord with the NPPF (2012), policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2012); policies DM2.1 and Policy DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the requirements of the Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
