    "The proposed change of use to restaurant use (Class A3) fails to comply with Condition C.2 (1) (f) (ii), Class C, Part 3, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as the proposal would be undesirable because of the impact on the adequate provision of services due to the loss of A1 floorspace which is considered to have a reasonable prospect of continued A1 use. Development Plan policy is material to the assessment of the application. In this case, no supporting marketing/vacancy evidence demonstrating a lack of demand for this floor space has been submitted and no exceptional circumstances exist which would justify the loss.  The proposed change of use from A1 use to restaurant and cafe (Use Class C3) would therefore be contrary to section 1 (building a strong, competitive economy) and section 8 (promoting healthy communities) of the NPPF, policies CS13 and CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM4.7 of the Development Management Policies 2013."
