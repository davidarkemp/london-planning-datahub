Suppressed tree is in moribund condition with decay in the main stem at two metres on the southern side. The tree has a very short life expectancy and the current landscaping works provide an ideal opportunity to establish a suitable placement tree.\r\n\r\nReplacement planting:\r\nAppropriate tree to be planted that will coordinate with the wider landscaping proposals and agreed with LB Islington.",

    "1. Tree Planting Condition:  A replacement tree is to be planted within twelve months of the removal of the existing False Acacia tree.  The position, size and species of the replacement tree are to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to planting taking place.  Details of soil preparation, staking, irrigation and maintenance of the tree are also to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to planting taking place.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the continued amenity provided by the tree and the planting of an appropriate species.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tCondition:  If the replacement tree dies, fails to establish, is removed, destroyed, uprooted or becomes seriously damaged or diseased within 5 years of the date of this consent, it must be replaced with another tree of the same size and species, and in the same location within one year of dying. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the continued amenity provided by the tree and the planting of an appropriate species."
