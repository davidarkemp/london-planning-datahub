  "description": "It is proposed that the existing slate roof covering will be completely removed and cleared from site. All existing fixings and associated lead work will also be removed and the roof made ready to receive a new slate covering. Welsh slates are to be supplied and laid to a minimum lap and gauge to suit roof slope BS EN 12326: Part 1 (minimum lap 90mm). All roof covering works are to be carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's/supplier's instructions and BS 5534: Code of Practice for Slating and Tiling. In line with the updated requirements of BS 5534 mechanical fixings are to be used when laying the roof. All existing lead flashings to the roof will be replaced in code 4 lead. All lead work is to be replaced and fixed in accordance with BS 6915. The box gutters will be fully replaced in a new lead covering with two expansion joints equally positioned. All existing zinc cladding is to be completely stripped back and renewed as part of this application.",
