    "By reason of the projection from the fascia, the extensive use of aluminium, which is not a characteristic material and the internal illumination the proposed fascia signs, the proposed advertisement would be overly large, unsympathetic and overly prominent signage that would detract from the character and appearance of the traditional shopfront, the locally listed building, the terraced row and the wider streetscene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the NPPF (2012), 7.4 of the London Plan (2015) policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 and DM2.6 of the Development Management Policies (2013)."
