    "1. Tree Planting Condition:  A replacement tree is to be planted within twelve months of the removal of the existing sycamore tree.  The position, size and species of the replacement tree are to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to planting taking place. The council would not expect the tree to be planted in the same place or it to be a large canopy species.  Details of soil preparation, staking, irrigation and maintenance of the tree are also to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to planting taking place.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure a continued amenity and crown cover provided by the tree and the planting of an appropriate species.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tCondition:  If the replacement tree dies, fails to establish, is removed, destroyed, uprooted or becomes seriously damaged or diseased within 5 years of the date of this consent, it must be replaced with another tree of the same size and species, and in the same location within one year of dying. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the continued amenity provided by the tree and the planting of an appropriate species."
