    "REASON: The Local Planning Authority is not satisfied, on the basis of the evidence submitted and the lack of corroborative evidence that it has been adequately established that the use of the first floor of the property has been in use as three self-contained studio residential flats (Use Class C3) for a continuous period of 4 years prior to the date of this application and that there has been no concealment of the untis. The use therefore cannot be established under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended in section 171(b)(1)."
