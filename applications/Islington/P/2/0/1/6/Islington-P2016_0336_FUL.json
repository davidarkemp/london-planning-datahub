    "Reason: The proposed first floor rear extension and rear first floor roof terrace and associated ballustrades by reason of their excessive design, scale, bulk  and massing is considered to form an overdominant and visually detrimental feature when seen from the surrounding private realm. The addition would fail to be a subservient and harmonious addition to the host building and  wider terrace setting. The proposed development is considered to  have a clear detrimental visual impact and is therefore considered to be contrary to London Plan 2015 Policies 7.4 & 7.6, CS policy 8 & 9, DM policy 2.1 and Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2006."
