    "REASON: The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its overall inappropriate design, height, bulk, massing and non-contextual use of materials would form a dominant, discordant and visually harmful addition to the rear of the host building.  The proposed development would fail to be a subservient and harmonious addition to the host property and wider terrace setting and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding conservation area. The proposal would fail to comply with policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Polices (2013), Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
