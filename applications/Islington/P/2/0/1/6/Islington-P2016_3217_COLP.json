Planning permission is therefore required for the proposed works. \r\n\r\nSecondly, part of the proposed rear extension would project more than 3 metres beyond the corresponding part of the rear wall of the dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015."
