    "REASON: The combination of the scale, extent and position of the proposed amendments including reconfiguration of the units and changes to position of split level units resulting in changes to the overall standard of the living accommodation; and changes to the building through alterations to layout, floor area, building volume and amenity spaces at first to fourth floor levels, are of such a scale that the proposals constitute a material change to the approved scheme. As such, the proposed amendment would not therefore constitute a non-material amendment and will require planning permission."
