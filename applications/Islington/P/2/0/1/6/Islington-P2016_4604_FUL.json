    "REASON: The design, appearance, depth and height of the proposed first floor rear extension along with the second floor roof terrace and associated structures, fails to remain subordinate to the host building due to the inappropriate design, scale, bulk and massing of the additions. The proposal is therefore unacceptable and contrary to  policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2015); policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), and guidance within the Chapel Market/Penton Street Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
