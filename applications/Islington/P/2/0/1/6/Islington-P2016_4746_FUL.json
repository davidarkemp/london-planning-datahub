    "REASON: The principle of the proposed enclosure of the front lightwell would result in an inappropriate and incongruous addition, by reasons of its siting, appearance, and uncharacteristic design would be an alien and discordant feature within the streetscene and would detract from the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding Barnsbury Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore considered to be in conflict with policies DM 2.1 and 2.3 of the Development Management Policies, Policies CS 7 and CS 8 of the Core Strategy, and the guidance in the Islington Urban Design Guide and the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines and in particular paragraphs 10.30 and 10.31."
