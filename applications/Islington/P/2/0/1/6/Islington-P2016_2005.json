  "description": "We are proposing to replace the existing rear window at lower ground floor level with French doors and widen the external staircase in order to allow\r\nmore natural light into the rear basement room. Internal collapsible shutters are to be installed inside the French doors to provide security in what would\r\notherwise susceptible to break-ins.\r\nWe propose to infill the wall between the basement hallway and the rear room and to provide glazed doors between these spaces to improve the natural\r\nlight in the hallway.\r\nThe door from the rear lobby giving onto the garden is draughty and not secure. It is not original. It is proposed to replace this door with a new four\r\npanel door, the two upper panels of which would be glazed. The door would have security locking and be well insulated and fitted with quality draught\r\nexcluders.\r\nIt is proposed to remove the existing unsightly fire resisting door between the hallway and the rear lobby which is an unfortunate and crude recent\r\naddition. In order to maintain the fire resisting requirement under the Building Regulations and to reduce draughts a sliding door is to be provided at the\r\ntop of the basement staircase. The new partition and door will not interfere with or cause damage to the historic fabric of the building.",
