Removal of two lowest branches on stem to south-western corner. Crown reduce south-western aspect of canopy by up to 6-7 metres to strong lateral growth (35%) and crown reduce the remainder of the tree by up to 3 metres to strong lateral growth (20%) to balance the crown. In addition, further pruning, if needed, of up to 2 metres to allow the safe use of the crane  \r\n\r\nReason for works: The pruning will allow the siting of a crane to facilitate the installation of a bridge.",
