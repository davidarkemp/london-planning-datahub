  "description": "It is proposed that the existing slate roof covering will be completely removed and cleared from site. All existing fixings and associated lead work will also be removed and the roof made ready to receive a new slate covering. Fibre cement slates to match existing are to be supplied and laid to a minimum lap and gauge to suit roof slope BS EN 12326: Part 1 (minimum lap 90mm). All roof covering works are to be carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's/supplier's instructions and BS 5534: Code of Practice for Slating and Tiling. In line with the updated requirements of BS 5534 mechanical fixings are to be used when laying the roof. Existing render to railings at street level to be removed, with railings set aside until render complete. Existing railings to then be re-installed. Timber softwood half glazed door to basement level to be removed and replaced like for like. Areas of defective render will be gently removed using a hammer and bolster. Care will be taken to ensure the brickwork is unaffected when removing the render. In order to ensure the integrity of the brickwork the render will be removed by hand in small sections. The brickwork is to be cleaned using water and a wire brush, removing any grime or soot. At this point it will be inspected and should the need arise repairs will be made. If the brickwork is unaffected the render can continue to be removed in the same fashion. Damaged brickwork will be cut out as necessary, either side of the fracture, one face only. New bricks will be stitched in, bed and pointed with a lime based mortar 1:3 hydraulic lime: sharp sand as recommended in Design & Conservation Guide No. 1 Brickwork and Mortar. Repointing where necessary will be carried out by raking out existing joints of brickwork minimum 12mm deep and repointing in mortar and remove spoil. The render will then be replaced to match existing with a 1:2:9 mix in line with the requirements of Islington Council.",
