The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to policy 12 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
