    "REASON: The proposed design, method of fixing of the awning, high level signage, method of illumination, design and location of the lanterns and uplights are considered to create cluttered and visually harmful additions to the host Grade II property to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding public real and conservation area. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 134 of policy 12 of the NPPF 2012, policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, and Development Management policies 2.1 & 2.3 and Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2006."
