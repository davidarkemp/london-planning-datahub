    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would harm the architectural character of the building, and the rhythm, uniformity and integrity of the terrace to the detriment of the wider area by reason that it would interrupt an unbroken roofline, would be visible from public viewpoints and would result in the loss of the traditional valley roof. The proposed mansard roof extension would represent an incongruous form of development that would therefore fail to comply with the NPPF (2012), policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2012); policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the requirements of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
