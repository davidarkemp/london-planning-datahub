    "The drawing titled \"existing shopfront signage\" illustrates the unlawful fascia sign that has been installed and not what lawfully existed previously.  It was noted during the site visit on 15/06/2016 that there is evidence of a previous timber fascia sign, which once served a restaurant that occupied the site, exists behind the unlawful fascia board.  The Council's Conservation Officer advised that fascia signs in this conservation area should be painted timber with painting or applied lettering lit by individual light fittings.  The applicant is encouraged to seek Advertisement Consent for a proposal befitting this advice once the unlawful signage is removed.\r\nIt is further advised that any forthcoming application should ensure that elevations include neighbouring properties (accurately) in order to assess the application in its context."
