    "The proposed development, by reason of its inappropriate layout, height, massing and proximity to nearby residential properties would result in unacceptable harm to the amenity of these residential occupiers through loss of daylight and sunlight, loss of outlook and sense of enclosure. This harm makes the proposal contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DM 2.1 of Islington's Local Plan: Development Management Policies (2013), as well as BRE 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice' (Second Edition 2011) and the benefits of the scheme are not considered to outweigh this harm."
