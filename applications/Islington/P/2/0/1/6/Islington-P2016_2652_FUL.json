    "REASON: The proposed roof extension fails to respect the character and appearance of the original modern infill building and its existing subordinate relationship with the original adjoining Listed terrace forming a dominant and discordant relationship with the adjoining Listed Building. The proposal would be readily visible from both the public and private realm from short and longer views, exerting a clear detrimental visual impact on the character and appearance of the host building, terrace setting and wider Barnsbury Conservation Areas setting. Therefore the proposal is unacceptable, contrary to policy 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2015), policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013) and guidance contained within the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
