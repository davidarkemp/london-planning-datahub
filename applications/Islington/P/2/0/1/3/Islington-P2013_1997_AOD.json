    "To assist applicants in a positive manner, the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Council’s website. \r\n\r\nA pre-application advice service is also offered and encouraged. Whilst this wasn’t taken up by the applicant, and although the scheme did not comply with guidance on receipt, the LPA acted in a proactive manner offering suggested improvements to the scheme (during application processing) to secure compliance with policies and written guidance. These were incorporated into the scheme by the applicant.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in a scheme that accords with policy and guidance as a result of \r\npositive, proactive and collaborative working between the applicant, and the LPA during the application stages, with the decision issued in a timely manner in accordance with the NPPF."
