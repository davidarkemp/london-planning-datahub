On receipt, the scheme did not comply with policy or guidance. Due to the nature of the proposal there is an in principle objection to the application and it was considered that minor amendments to the scheme would not make the application acceptable. For that reason it was considered that a refusal was the most appropriate course of action. \r\n\r\nThe LPA delivered the decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF."
