    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would be situated within a terrace that has a uniform and predominantly unaltered roofline and by reason of its size, design, and location would be out of character with the existing building harming the architectural integrity of the locally listed host building, the rhythm and unity of the terrace as a whole, and would neither preserve or enhance the chanater and appearance of the Duncan Terrace/Colebrook Row Conservation Area.  The development is contrary to policy 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011, policies DM2.1 (Design) and DM2.3 (Heritage) of the Islingtonâ€™s Development Management Policies 2013,  Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011."
