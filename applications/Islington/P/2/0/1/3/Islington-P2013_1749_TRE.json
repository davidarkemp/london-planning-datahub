    "The application to fell the tree has been refused for two reasons:\r\n(i)\ton the basis of loss of a visual amenity and \r\n(ii)\ton the basis that the agent has failed to supply sufficient  justification or evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree requires removal. \r\n \r\n\r\nLoss of visual amenity\r\n\r\nThe tree contributes materially to the amenities of the locality, playing an important part in providing a sense of scale, maturity and textural diversity to the immediate vicinity. The loss of the tree would be detrimental to the amenity of the immediate locality and to the wider conservation area.\r\n\r\nThe tree is situated within the Canonbury Conservation area and the council deemed this tree worthy of the implication of a TPO in 2007. The level of amenity provided since the imposition of the TPO has not declined.\r\n    \r\n\r\nJustification for removal and lack of supporting evidence\r\n\r\nSufficient justification for the removal of the tree has not been submitted.  Neither the drive expansion nor light loss are overriding arboricultural reasons for the removal of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe Council considers that without justification or evidence to support the removal of the tree council cannot reasonably permit the removal of this protected tree. Other options to manage the issues raised that require the removal of the tree do not appear to have been considered."
