    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive height and depth, its flat roof design, prominent corner location and reduction in garden space, would represent an incongruous form of development, that would not be subordinate to the existing property, would detract from the sylvan quality and spacious appearance of the locality and would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the conservation area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011), policy DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and guidance contained within the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
