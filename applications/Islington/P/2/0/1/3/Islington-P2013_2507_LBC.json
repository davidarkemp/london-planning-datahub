    "The proposal will result in the unacceptable infilling of an important gap between properties, inappropriately alter the original form of the ground-floor entrance bay, undermine the architectural integrity of the listed building and result in the loss of original fabric.  The infilling of the important gap will lead to an inappropriate terracing effect and visually harm the listed group and conservation area.  Consequently, the proposed works would unacceptably harm the significance of the heritage assets (listed building, listed group and conservation area).  The proposed works are, therefore, contrary to Policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Sustaining and Enhancing the Significance of Heritage Assets) of the London Plan 2011, Policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of the Islington Development Management Policies."
