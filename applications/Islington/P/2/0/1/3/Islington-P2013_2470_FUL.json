    "REASON : The proposed extension is considered by reason of its design, scale and siting to fail to respect the architectural integrity of the property and those surrounding and the wider established rhythm and arrangement of the terrace.  The proposed extension, by reason of its siting away from the rear elevation of the main property and extending to the rear boundary line is considered to be over dominant and fail to remain subservient to the original building and is also considered to have a harmful effect on the quality of the surrounding public and private realm.  The proposal is not considered to comply with the objectives of policies DM2.1 of the Dvelopment Management policies 2013, policy CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and the objectives of the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
