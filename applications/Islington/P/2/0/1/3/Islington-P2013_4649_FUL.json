    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, by reason of its excessive scale and height, its extensive glazing and its prominent location, would constitute an obtrusive and overly dominant form of development that would not integrate with the property and would dominate views of the property, appearing incongruous in views of the locality and St James church spire and steeple,. It would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the application property, the conservation area and the setting of a listed building and local landmark contrary to policies 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011), policies CS7, CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1, DM2.3 and DM2.5 of the Development Management Policies (2013), policy BC7 of the Finsbury Local Plan (2012) and guidance contained within the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
