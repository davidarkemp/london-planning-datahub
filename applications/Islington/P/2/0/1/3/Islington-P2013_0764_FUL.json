    "The proposed roof extension and alterations would significantly disrupt the consistency and unity of the historic unaltered front and rear roofline of the host terrace, the development being visible from the public realm in views from the front, side, and rear. The proposal would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host locally listed building, the adjoining locally listed terrace and the surrounding Canonbury Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments), 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture), and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington’s Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions), D25 (Roof Extensions), and D42 (Buildings on the Local List) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, emerging policies DM1 (Design), DM3 (Heritage) and DM11 (Residential conversions and extensions) of the Islington Development Management Policies (EiP Submission 2012), together with the guidance provided in section 2.4 of the Islington Urban Design Guide SPD and Paragraphs 8.14 & 8.16 of the Islington Conservation Area Design Guidelines SPG."
