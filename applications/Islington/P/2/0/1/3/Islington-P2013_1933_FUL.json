    "To assist applicants the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Councilâ€™s website. \r\n\r\nA pre-planning application advice service is also offered and encouraged. \r\n\r\nIn this instance the pre-application advice provided to the applicant, on three occassions was not adhered to, therefore the LPA determined the application in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF. Whilst the scheme differed from that discussed at pre-application stage and therefore has attracted a greater number of reasons for refusal that were identified as problems at the pre-application stage, given that fundamental design and tree issues as well as a poor mix of units were submitted despite previous advice against this, the application was refused in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nThe LPA invites the applicant to enter into collaborative pre-planning application discussions to assist in the preparation of a new planning application to overcome the reasons for refusal contained herein."
