    "The proposed roof extension would be situated within a terrace that has a largely uniform and predominantly unaltered roofline and by reason of its excessive width and the inappropriate fenestration layout and detail, the proposed dormer window would represent an overdominant and incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the appearance of the host building, the rhythm and integrity of the terrace and the character and appearance of the locality, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011), policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and guidance contained within the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
