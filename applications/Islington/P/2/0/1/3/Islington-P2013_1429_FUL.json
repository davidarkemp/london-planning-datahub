    "The proposed mansard roof extension is not acceptable due to the visibility of the extension from private views and its disruption of the predominantly unbroken and established roofline, adding to the harm already caused by the mansard at No.29. The proposals would erode the architectural unity of the terrace which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area. Therefore the proposal would be contrary to the requirements of the NPPF, and fails to accord with Policy CS 9 of the Core Strategy 2011 (CS), policies DM1 and DM3 of the emerging Development Management policies, submission June 2012, policies D4, D11 and D25 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guide (2004) and para. 2.4.2 of the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
