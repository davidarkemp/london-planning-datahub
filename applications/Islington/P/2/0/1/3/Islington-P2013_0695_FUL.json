    "REASON: The rear extension represents a prominent and discordant feature which by virtue of its form, design and materials fails to respect the character and appearance of the host building, neighbouring properties and the wider Highbury Fields Conservation Area. The extension is thereby considered to be unacceptable and fails to comply with policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, Policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM1 and DM3 of the emerging Development Management Policies document (submission June 2012), policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Extensions and Alterations), D22 (New Development) and D24 (Materials) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan, the guidance of the Islington Urban Design Guide.\r\n\r\nPositive Statement:\r\nTo assist applicants in a positive manner, the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Councilâ€™s website. \r\n\r\nA pre-application advice service is also offered and encouraged. The LPA delivered the decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF."
