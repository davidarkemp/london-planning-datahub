    "The scale and massing of the proposed extension would represent an excessive and incongruous rear addition to the original property, fundamentally altering the proportions and character of the original building, causing unacceptable harm to the character of the Listed building. The complete loss of the former rear garden area would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and the character and apearance of the conservation area. The works would, therefore, cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to policy 12 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 (design) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013; guidance contained within the Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002, Islington Urban Design Guide 2006 and English Heritage guidance ‘London terraced Houses 1660-1860’."
