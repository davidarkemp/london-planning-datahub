    "You are reminded that under the wording of Condition 8 (Accessibility) of P111124 you are required to ensure that all accessibility features are maintained and operational at all times. It was noted that on a site visit on the 14th August 2014 the automated doors to the main visitor entrance of the school were not operational, and had not been operational in a way that wheelchair users could gain access to the building unassisted since the extension to the school was completed. You are advised to resolve this issue in a timely manner in order to avoid possible enforcement action."
