    "The proposed crown reduction would be detrimental to the trees health and the amenity and environmental benefits that the trees provide. The works have been refused for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1.\tLack of arboricultural justification or reason for the proposed crown reduction works.\r\n2.\tLoss of amenity and associated environmental benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nLack of Arboricultural Justification\r\n\r\nThe trees are in apparent good health, form and vigour with no obvious irredeemable defects.  No arboricultural justification has been supplied for the crown reduction of these trees. The council is under no obligation to permit any works other than the minimal works to abate a nuisance.  \r\n\r\nThe reason given for the crown reduction with the application was that ‘the trees are becoming a little overgrown and obstruction the parking area to the front of the property’.\r\nAlternative pruning works are more appropriate to alleviate the issues raised, such as a crown lift of sub-lateral branches to 3m above ground level on all aspects this will remove obstruction and allow vehicles to use the car park area safely. These works are the minimum required to abate any current nuisance and the council feel it is reasonable to refuse any further works which would be detrimental to the health and amenity of the trees.\r\n\r\nLoss of Amenity and Environmental benefits\r\n\r\nThe trees prominent location provides amenity to the residents in the immediate locality but also to the large number of drivers and pedestrians using the City Road throughout the year. \r\nA reduction in canopy size will reduce the valuable amenity that these trees currently provide but may also restrict them from achieving far greater amenity if left to achieve their potential canopy size.\r\n\r\nThis species has the potential to be a large canopy tree and in appropriate sites it is recognised as good arboricultural practice to allow a tree to grow to its full potential where   sufficient space above and below ground exists for it to do so.\r\n  \r\nThese trees have ample space to utilise for future growth and achieve a larger canopy, the tree branches are currently over 8m from the adjacent property.\r\nLarge canopy trees exponentially provide greater environmental benefits than small trees. In this location adjacent to a busy though-fare the benefits, such as particulate and rain water interception are needed the most."
