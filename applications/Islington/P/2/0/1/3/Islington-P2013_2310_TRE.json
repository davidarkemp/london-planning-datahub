  "description": "I propose to fell one Holly tree.  The tree is about 20ft tall and within 2 feet of the front wall of my house.  The roots came through under the bay window of the house and up through floorboards into the front room of my house.  I had to have work done to repair the damage to the front including cracks in the party wall.  The branches are also pressing into the front right window of the first floor of the house.\r\nI' ve been advised that a tree so close to the house will continue to cause danage to the structure of the front of the house.",
