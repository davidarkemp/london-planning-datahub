    "To assist applicants the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the councilâ€™s website. \r\n\r\nA pre-planning application advice service is also offered and encouraged. \r\n\r\nIn this instance the submission of an application for planning permission for replacement windows was referred to in an appeal decision dated 12/02/2013, and such an application was invited by the council in its letter of 18/02/2013. The council provided further advice on 19/06/2013 regarding the window materials and design that would be appropriate in this location, however this pre-application advice provided to the applicant's agent was not adhered to, therefore the LPA determined the application in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF.\r\n\r\nThe LPA invites the applicant to enter into collaborative pre-planning application discussions to assist in the preparation of a new planning application."
