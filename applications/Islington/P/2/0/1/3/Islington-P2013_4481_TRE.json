    "REASON:\r\nThe application to fell the tree should be refused for two equal reasons:\r\n(i)\ton the basis of loss of a visual amenity and \r\n(ii)\ton the basis that the agent has failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree requires removal. \r\n\r\nLoss of visual amenity\r\nThe tree contributes materially to the amenities of the locality, playing an important part in providing a sense of scale, maturity and textural diversity to the immediate vicinity.\r\nThe tree is situated in a prominent location and the council deemed this tree worthy of the imposition of a TPO in 2013. The level of amenity provided since the imposition of the TPO has not declined.\r\n\r\nLevel of evidence\r\nWe do not currently have the level of evidence we require to allow this tree to be removed, the level of evidence and detail required being commensurate with the amenity value of the tree. In this particular case taking a balanced view the Council considers that the evidence so far presented does not meet the tests Islington Council consider appropriate in considering the removal of this preserved tree. \r\nThere is a lack of evidence to indicate vegetative subsidence. The oedometer, penetrometer and moisture content readings do not demonstrate desiccation. There are discrepancies between the different reports supplied, from Matlab ( 16/07/13) and CET (19/09/13). They  indicate trial pits in the same location indicate different foundation types, concrete or crushed brick.\r\nThe drains are damaged and no repair has been noted, water seeping from damaged drains can produce similar symptoms to vegetative subsidence. This possible cause of the damage needs to be discounted for Islington to consider the removal of the tree, especially with the limited evidence to indicate desiccation. We would expect to see level monitoring results after the drainage repairs to identify if this is a contributory factor.\r\nWe will require detail of the nature and estimated cost of options to repair the damage if the tree is removed and if the tree remains. Without an estimation of this the council cannot make an informed decision as to the relative value of the tree against the cost of repair options.\r\nDue to these factors Islington Council feels that further reports are necessary to make an informed decision on whether the tree should be felled."
