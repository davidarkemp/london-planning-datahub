The proposals are considered to be out of keeping with the character of/ and cause harm to a non-designated heritage asset, and as such fail to either preserve or enhance the adjoining Tufnell Park conservation area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Islington Core Strategy (2011); policies DM2.1 (Design) and DM2.3 (Heritage) of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013); and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
