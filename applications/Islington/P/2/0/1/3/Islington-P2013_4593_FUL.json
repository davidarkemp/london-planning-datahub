    "REASON:  In the absence of any continuous marketing and vacancy data, the proposed change of use would result in the unjustified loss of Class D1 floorspace that is considered suitable for education use by virtue of its accessibility, prominence and suitability and would not provide employment generation expected of a site within an Employment Growth Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 3.16 (protection and enhancement of social infrastructure) of the London Plan 2015 and policies CS 13 (Employment spaces), of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.3 (Heritage), DM5.1 (New business floorspace) and DM4.12 (Social and Strategic Infrastructure and Cultural Facilities) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
