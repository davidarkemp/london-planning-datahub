    "The proposed second floor rear extension, by reason of its height, width, design and that it would remove a characteristic window, would compromise the integrity of and fail to respect the historical architectural qualities of the listed building, and would undermine the rhythm of the terrace. As such, the proposed second floor extension would detract from the historic character and appearance of the listed building, the setting of the listed terraced row and the conservation area. The proposed development would be contrary to policy 12 of the NPPF, policies D3, D4, D11, D22 and D28 of the Unitary Development Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy and policy 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011), policies DM1 and DM3 of the emerging Development Management Policies document (Submission June 2012) and to the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)"
