    "REASON: The proposed roof extension and roof terrace would be situated within a terrace that has a uniform and unaltered roofline and by reason of their design, scale, form and location they would form overdominant and incongruous elements within the host terrace, disrupting its rhythm and unity when seen from both the public and private realm. The proposed extensions are considered to be contrary to CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), Development Management policy 2.1, paragraphâ€™s 2.4.2 & 2.4.3 of Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and The NPPF 2012."
