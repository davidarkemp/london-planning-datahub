    "REASON: The proposed works by virtue of the increase in the size of the lightwell and the incorporation of the windows at basement level would instill a greater residential feel to the former public house which is considered harmful to its character as a building of special interest and would fail to preserve or enhance the Duncan Terrace/Colebrook Row Conservation Area. The proposal is thereby contrary to paragraph 134 of policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Sustaining and Enhancing the significance of Heritage Assets) of the London Plan 2011 and Policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policy D13 (Design) and DM3 (Heritage) of Islington's Emerging Development Management Policies (June 2012 Submission)."
