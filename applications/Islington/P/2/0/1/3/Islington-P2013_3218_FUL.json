    "To assist applicants the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Councilâ€™s website. \r\n\r\nA pre-planning application advice service is also offered and encouraged however no pre-application discussions were entered into. \r\n\r\nOn receipt, the scheme did not comply with policy or guidance. Due to the nature of the proposal there is an in principle objection to the application and it was considered that there were no minor adjustments that would make the application acceptable. For that reason it was considered that a refusal was the most appropriate course of action. \r\n\r\nThe LPA delivered the decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF"
