  "description": "The proposal seeks to rebuild the brick piers of the front boundary wall to align them with those of the front entrance steps; add a new black metal railing to either side of the path to the front steps and a rail to mirror the existing on the up-stand wall to the front steps. The proposals also seek to re-clad the path between the front boundary and entrance steps with Yorkstone. This application may affect the character and appearance of the conservation area.
