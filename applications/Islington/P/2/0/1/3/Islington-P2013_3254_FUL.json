    "The proposed convent building, by reason of its height, depth and close proximity to the neighbouring building 1-9 Julius Nyerere Close, would result in an unacceptable loss of light to the side windows of the neighbouring property and would therefore detrimentally impact upon the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers contrary to policies DM2.1, DM3.4 and DM3.9 of the Development Management Policies (2013), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), policy 7.6 of the London Plan and the guidance set out in Islingtonâ€™s Urban Design Guide (2006)."
