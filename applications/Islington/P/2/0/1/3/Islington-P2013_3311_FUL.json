    "REASON: The proposal seeks to introduce a commercially operated self-storage facility into a highly residential area that is well used by cyclists and pedestrians. The proposal is considered to result in a detrimental impact on road safety, to increase congestion, increase pressures on on-street car parking in the area, place more pressure on the on-street network and affect the adjoining residentâ€™s amenity levels in terms of noise and pollution coming from the increased traffic movements and congestion through the operation of the use. The proposed development is considered to be contrary to Development Management Policies (2013) DM2.1, 8.1, 8.4 & 8.6 and London Plan policies 6.2, 6.3, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 7.3, 7.5, 7.13, 7.14 and 7.15 and paragraph 32 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
