  "description": "Rear Garden\r\n2 x Bay - Located right hand boundary. Judiciously reduce crowns by approximately 20% (1.5m), thin crown density of the tree nearest the house by approximately 20%. Ensure the natural flowing aspect of the crowns is retained as is practicable. Raise crowns by up to 0.5m. This action will increase light levels whilst preserving tree health. Screening properties will be retained. Treesâ€™ natural characteristics and aesthetic value will be preserved.\r\nHolly - Located rear centre. Approximately 7m. Reduce height of stem to right of tree by approximately 1-1.5m.\r\nAcer - Remove major dead wood.\r\nCherry - Located in 32 Mercers Road and overhanging boundary. Remove dead wood only.",
