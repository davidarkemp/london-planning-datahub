    "The proposed roof extension to the front roof slope would be situated within a terrace that has a predominantly uniform and unaltered rear roofline. The proposed roof extension, by virue of its inappropriate design, would be harmful to the appearance of the host building, disrupt the rhythm and unity of the terrace of which it forms a part of and be directly harmful to both immediate and long views from the streetscene. The development is therefore contrary to policies 7.4 (Local character) and 7.6 (Architecture) of the London Plan 2011, policies CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islingtonâ€™s built and historic environment) of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guide and in particular paragraphs 10.24 and 10.26, and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006 and in particular sections 2.4.2 (Protecting Unaltered Rooflines) and 2.4.3 (Rooflines with existing alterations/extensions)"
