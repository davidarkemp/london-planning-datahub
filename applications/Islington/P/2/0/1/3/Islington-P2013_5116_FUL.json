A pre-planning application advice service is also offered and encouraged.  In this instance the pre-application advice provided to the applicant was not adhered to, therefore the LPA determined the application in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF. The LPA invites the applicant to enter into collaborative pre-planning application discussions to assist in the preparation of a new planning application."
