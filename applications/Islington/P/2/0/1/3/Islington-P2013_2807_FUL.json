    "To assist applicants the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Councilâ€™s website.\r\n\r\nA pre-planning application advice service is also offered and encouraged.\r\n\r\nIn this instance pre application advice was not obtained by the applicant.\r\n \r\nThe LPA acted in a proactive manner, offering suggested improvements to the scheme to comply with policies and written guidance that were adopted by the applicant. However, the application was considered by the LPA's planning committee who concluded that the application remained contrary to the  LPAS's policies. \r\n\r\nThe LPA delivered the decision in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF.\r\n\r\nThe LPA invites the applicant to enter into collaborative pre-planning application discussions to assist in the preparation of a new planning application."
