    "COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE LEVY (CIL) (GRANTING CONSENT):  Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), this development is liable to pay the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This will be calculated in accordance with the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. One of the development parties must now assume liability to pay CIL by submitting an Assumption of Liability Notice to the Council at cil@islington.gov.uk. The Council will then issue a Liability Notice setting out the amount of CIL that is payable.  \r\n\r\nFailure to submit a valid Assumption of Liability Notice and Commencement Notice prior to commencement of the development may result in surcharges being imposed. The above forms can be found on the planning portal at: www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/whattosubmit/cil \r\n\r\nPre-Commencement Conditions:\r\nThese conditions are identified with an 'asterix' * in front of the short description. These conditions are important from a CIL liability perspective as a scheme will not become CIL liable until all of these indentified pre-commencement conditions have been discharged."
