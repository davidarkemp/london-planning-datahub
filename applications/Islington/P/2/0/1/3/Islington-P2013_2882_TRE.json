  "description": "London Plane in rear garden\r\nReduce branches overhanging to rear of property to allow 3-4m clearance from building to rear. Crown thin by 20%. This is to maintain clearance from surrounding properties, and to maintain a healthy tree, removing any dead or diseased branches (possible Massaria infection).\r\nSycamore at boundary with no. 11: Re-pollard. This tree is badly decayed, as previously shown in report supplied to Islington (J Ryan), 2 years ago. A replacement tree has\r\nbeen planted and the Sycamore needs pollarding so as not to impede the growth of the new tree.",
