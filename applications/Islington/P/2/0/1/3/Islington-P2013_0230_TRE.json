    "The application to fell the tree has been refused for two reasons:\r\n\r\n(i)\ton the basis of loss of a visual amenity and \r\n(ii)\ton the basis that the agent has failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree requires removal. \r\n\r\n\r\nLoss of visual amenity\r\nThe tree contributes materially to the amenities of the locality, playing an important part in providing a sense of scale, maturity and textural diversity to the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe tree is situated within the Barnsbury Conservation area and the council deemed this tree worthy of the implication of a TPO in 2002. The level of amenity provided since the imposition of the TPO has not declined.\r\n\r\nLevel of evidence\r\nWe do not currently have the level of evidence we require to allow this tree to be removed. Further investigation may be appropriate, including the non invasive decay detection techniques. \r\nThe reason given by the agent for the removal of this tree:\r\n\r\n1)\tRotting caused by fungus growth (Pholiota squarrosa)\r\n2)\tRisk of wind throw\r\n\r\n\r\nRotting caused by fungus growth\r\nIt is alleged that the tree has a fungal infection by the wood decay fungus Pholiota squarrosa – This is a common fungi on Robinia.\r\n\r\nPhotocopy submitted with the application as evidence of the identification is from Watson & Green (2011) Fungi on Trees Arboricultural Association.\r\n\r\nNo samples of the fungi have been sent for positive identification and no photographic evidence has been submitted identifying the location of the fruiting body to T1. \r\n\r\nI agree with the assessment provided that P. squarrosa ‘can become extensive enough to cause failure’. In this instance there is no evidence of extensive decay. The site investigation failed to find any evidence of fungal ingress or resulting reaction by the tree.\r\n\r\nThe assessment provided by the agent also outlined that:\r\n\r\n‘The decay can become extensive enough to cause failure, and so the stem base and principal roots should be inspected in detail in high-usage localities. However, adaptive growth often compensates adequately for loss of stiffness and hollowing.’\r\n\r\nSo the assessment made by the agent states that extensive decay may cause failure but adaptive growth often compensates adequately for the loss of stiffness and hollowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRisk of wind throw\r\nThe condition of the tree has no obvious symptoms that correspond with the tree being at risk from wind throw.\r\n\r\nEven if a proportion of decay is found the removal of a tree is often not the most appropriate management. Trees may co exist with fungal decay for many years without undue risk. A common method of management for trees with an established decay fungi ( dependant on species of host and parasite) is the crown maintenance and regular inspection of the tree.  \r\n\r\nThe risk management of trees infected includes expert investigation, positive identification, regular inspection and possible mitigating tree pruning works.\r\n\r\nThe council do not currently have the level of evidence we require to allow this tree to be removed. Without evidence of decay the council cannot reasonably permit the removal of this protected tree."
