    "LIMITED ADVERTISEMENT CONSENT PERIOD:  The advertisement display hereby approved is granted only for a limited period, being until 31 January 2014, on or before that date the advertisement display shall be removed and the building on which it was fixed, or the land on which it was sited shall be returned to the state/condition in which it was maintained prior to the grant of this planning permission; unless another state/condition is agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nREASON:  The temporary advertisement is such that the Local Planning Authority is only prepared to grant permission for a limited period in view of the special circumstances of this case being that the advertisement is only required during the operation of the temporary sales & marketing suite, granted permission for a 12 month period until 31/01/2013.  The limitation of the consent period ensures compliance with policies: D3 and Env11 of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and policy CS8 of the Core Strategy 2011."
