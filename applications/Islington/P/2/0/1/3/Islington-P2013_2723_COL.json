    "The application has been refused as use of land for a 'laundrette' is a sui generis use under the Land Use Gazetter, which requires planning permission.\r\n\r\nThis refusal does not prejudice any future applications for planning permission for the use of the land for a laundrette.\r\n\r\nThe applicant is encouraged to make a new planning applicaion for the use of the land.\r\n\r\nTo assist applicants the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Councilâ€™s website. \r\n\r\nA pre-planning application advice service is also offered and encouraged.\r\n\r\nNo pre-application discussions were entered into. On receipt, the scheme did not comply with policy or guidance. \r\n\r\nThe LPA delivered the decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF.\r\n\r\nThe LPA invites the applicant to enter into a collaborative pre-planning application discussion process to assist in the preparation of a new planning application."
