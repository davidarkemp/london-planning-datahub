    "REASON: The Local Planning Authority is not satisfied that the evidence provided is sufficiently precise and unambiguous to support the claim that the application property has been used continuously as a B1a office for a ten year period up until the date of the application. Therefore, the application fails to prove on the balance of probability that the lawful use of the property is as a B1a office as required by section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)."
