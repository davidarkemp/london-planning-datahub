Due to the nature of the proposal it was considered that there were no minor amendments that would make the application acceptable. For that reason it was considered that a refusal was the most appropriate course of action. \r\n\r\nThe LPA delivered the decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF."
