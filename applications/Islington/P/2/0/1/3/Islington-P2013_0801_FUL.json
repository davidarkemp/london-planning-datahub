    "The proposal would result in the unjustified loss of the existing traditional shopfront resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the host locally listed building, the streetscene and the surrounding Upper Street (North) Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.4 (Local character), 7.6 (Architecture) and 7.8 (Heritage assets and archaeology) of the London Plan 2011, policies CS4 (Highbury Corner and Holloway Road) and CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islingtonâ€™s built and historic environment) of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extensions) and D13 (Shopfronts) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002, emerging policies, DM1 (Design), DM3 (Heritage) and DM25 (Shopfronts) of the Islington Development Management Policies (EiP Submission 2012), and the guidance contained in the Islington Conservation Area Guidelines SPG. As the proposal would not bring public benefits which would outweigh the harm caused, the proposal is also contrary to national guidance set out in the NPPF."
