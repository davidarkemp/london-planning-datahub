    "The proposal roof extension would result in the loss of the historic valley roof which forms a significant part of the character of the buildings in the Arlington Square Conservation Area, and as the first full width rear roof extension in the terrace and surrounding area would be unacceptable in principle, as it would visually disrupt the existing roofscape. Therefore the proposal would represent an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the setting of the Locally Listed building, the integrity of the terrace and the character and appearance of the Arlington Square Conservation area. The proposal is contrary to policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and guidance contained within the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006) and in particular sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, the Arlington Square Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and in particular paragraph 4.9."
