    "The proposed removal of the spine wall at second floor level, by virtue of the detrimental impact on the internal historic plan form, and the insertion of a 6-over-6 sash window at the rear, by virtue of its inappropriate scale and siting, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the grade II listed building and its setting and would fail to preserve the character of the Barnsbury conservation area. The works would, therefore, cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset and its setting contrary to paragraph policy 12 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.1 (design) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013 and the English Heritage guidance ‘London Terraced Houses 1660-1860’."
