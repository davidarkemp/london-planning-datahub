    "The proposal would result in the creation of a large ‘destination venue’ restaurant capable of catering for both large parties of people (such as wedding or business functions) or a large number of smaller groups of people (standard restaurant dinners). As such, it is considered that the cumulative impact of the operation of such a large A3 unit, with banqueting scale facilities, would have the potential to result in an unacceptable increase in the level of noise and disturbance experienced by neighbouring residential occupiers, caused as a result of large numbers of people arriving / leaving at the same time and large groups of people congregating outside of the premises to smoke. Therefore, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policy Env17 (Protecting Amenity) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and emerging policies DM18 (Maintaining and promoting small and independent shops), DM19 (Entertaining and the night-time economy), DM20 (Location and concentration of uses), and DM21 (Promoting Islington’s Town Centres) of the Islington Development Management Policies (EiP Submission 2012)."
