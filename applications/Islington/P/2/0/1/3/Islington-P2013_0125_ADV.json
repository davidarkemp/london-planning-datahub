    "STANDARD ADVERTISEMENT CONDITION (COMPLIANCE):  Any advertisement displayed and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a clean and tidy condition to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nAny structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a safe condition. \r\n\r\nWhere an advertisement is required under these Regulations to be removed, the removal shall be carried out to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. \r\n\r\nNo advertisement is to be displayed without permission of the owner of the site or any other people with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission. \r\n\r\nNo advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of any road traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or so as otherwise to render hazardous the use of any highway, railway, waterway (including any coastal waters) or aerodrome (civil or military).\r\n\r\nThe maximum luminance for the advertisement shall not exceed 600cd/sq m during the day and 350cd/sq m at night.\r\n\r\nThe proposed illuminated sign must not have any intermittent light source, moving feature, animation or exposed cold cathode tubing. It must not move, flash or change colour in any way and must not involve red, amber or green illumination so as to not distract from the traffic signals. \r\n\r\nThe footway and carriageway on the A501 City Road must not be blocked during the installation and maintenance of the sign.  Temporary obstruction during the installation must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians, or obstruct the flow of traffic."
