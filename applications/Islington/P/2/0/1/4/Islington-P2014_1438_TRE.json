    "Condition:  A replacement tree is to be planted within twelve months of the removal of the existing T2 sycamore tree Part of G1 at the rear of the buiklding.  The position, size and species of the replacement tree are to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to planting taking place.  Details of soil preparation, staking, irrigation and maintenance of the tree are also to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to planting taking place.\r\n\r\nIn addition another tree is to be planted to replace the four trees that have been removed without permission at the front of the property. So two replacement trees in total will need to be planted.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the continued amenity provided by the tree and the planting of an appropriate species."
