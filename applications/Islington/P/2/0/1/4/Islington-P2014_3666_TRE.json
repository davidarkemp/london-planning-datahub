Crown reduce back to previous points of reduction whilst leaving furnishing growth to include a 2m height reduction of top branches only.\r\nT2 Sycamore: Crown reduce back to previous points of reduction whilst leaving furnishing growth (no more than 1-1.5m in places) Clear building of leaf area by 2m. Reduce lowest branch over drive by approximately 2m back into main crown line. No crown lift as this will be dealt with by clearance from building.\r\nT3 Mulberry: Reduce lowest limb towards east back to old pruning point at 2m from stem of tree. Crown lift to 3m above ground level. Clear property by 2m and crown reduce tree back to the previous points of reduction whilst leaving furnishing growth.",
