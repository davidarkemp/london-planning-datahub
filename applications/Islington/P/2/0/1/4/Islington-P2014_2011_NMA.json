    "The combination of massing and extent of the proposed flue are of such proportions and its position adjacent a highway are such that it becomes a material change to the external appearance of the property. The proposed amendment constitutes development which is removed by the Article 4 Direction, and is considered to constitute a material change. As such, the proposed amendment would not therefore constitute a non-material amendment and will require planning permission."
