    "The proposed roof alterations. by reason of their design and appearance, along with the uncertainty of the delivery of all individual roof extensions, would introduce an incongruous feature to the buildings and terrace harming the historic form, design and appearance of the existing locally listed buildings, the roofscape uniformity of this part of the existing terrace, and would neither preserve or enhance the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area.  The proposed development is therefore considered contrary to CS9 of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, DM2.1 and Policy DM2.3 of Islington’s Development Management Policies and Policy 7.8 of the London Plan."
