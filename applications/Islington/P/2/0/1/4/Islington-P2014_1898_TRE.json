While the notification of intent to prune the Lime trees has been permitted (not been refused) by the local authority, the pruning of the trees is a civil matter between the applicant and the tree owner. It is strongly advised that the written permission of the tree owner be obtained prior to any works to the three lime trees.\r\n  \r\nThis is a civil matter for the two parties to address, should this matter not be resolved within the next two years, notification would need to re submitted to the authority."
