    "REASON: The information submitted does not clearly demonstrate that the homeless hostel use has been abandoned. The building is in tact externally, as the windows, roof and external walls are in a good condition. The property has not been used for any other purpose since 2006, and this length of time is not in itself considered to be excessive. Finally, the ownerâ€™s intentions are not considered to be determinative; the application P082587 and associated correspondence demonstrate that the owner did seek to recommence a similar use. Applying the tests provided by Trustees of Castell-y-Mynach Estate v SoS 10/7/84, it is considered that the use has not been abandoned. The lawful use of the property remains as a hostel use, provided by the 1997 consent."
