    "To assist applicants the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Council's website. A pre-planning application advice service is also offered and encouraged. No pre-application discussions were entered into. On receipt, the scheme did not comply with policy or guidance. The LPA delivered the decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF. The LPA invites the applicant to enter into a collaborative pre-planning application discussion process to assist in the preparation of a new planning application."
