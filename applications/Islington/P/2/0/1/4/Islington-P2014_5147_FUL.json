On receipt, the scheme did not comply with policy or guidance. The LPA acted in a proactive manner offering suggested improvements to the scheme to secure compliance with policies and written guidance which were not adopted by the applicant during the application stage.\r\n\r\nThe LPA delivered the decision in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF.\r\n\r\nThe LPA invites the applicant to enter into a collaborative pre-planning application discussion process to assist in the preparation of a new planning application."
