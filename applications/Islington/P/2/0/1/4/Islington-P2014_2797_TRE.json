    "Reason for request: Tree has not been maintained in keeping with neighbouring trees over many years. It has already knocked a party wall over.\r\nResponse: The tree within the front garden of 306 Liverpool Road is a much larger and older tree (at least twice the age) than the two trees within the front garden of 308 Liverpool Road. The trees at 308 have been maintained at their height and spread at a much earlier age and on a more regular frequency than the tree at 306 Liverpool Road.\r\nThe tree is being inspected and maintained at regular intervals by the owners of the tree.     A decision notice was sent to the owners of 306 Liverpool Road for a 10% crown reduction on 31st May 2012 and another decision notice was sent in October 2010 for more minor works including cutting back from the property. \r\nThe proposal to reduce the tree in size to match the adjacent trees in 308 Liverpool Road will be detrimental to tree health. The tree is already within a cycle of reduction and is maintained on a three year cycle. In essence, the request to match the height of the adjacent trees will equate to the reduction in height of approximately 7-8m (or 6.5m below the previous pruning points to allow for the new branches that have grown from the last pruning cycle). It is council policy to retain healthy trees where possible. Pruning such as this will leave large diameter wounds on a tree which is likely to lead to decay pockets at this height and defects to the trees structure.\r\nLow boundary walls can be maintained and rebuilt using basic engineering solutions such as lintels and railings for example. A substantial crown reduction of a tree is not going to improve an already damaged wall.\r\nVery heavy of pruning of trees is not good practice unless there is sound arboricultural reason to do so and tree height is not a justifiable reason on its own.\r\nReason for request: The tree is substantially bigger and higher than neighbouring trees and with children living at both 304 and 306 there is a concern about branches or debris falling from such a height (for example in extreme windy conditions as we have experienced this year).\r\nResponse: As explained, the tree is older and has not had the same cyclical pruning as with number 308 Liverpool Road from an earlier age. I have inspected the tree from ground level and cannot see any large dead or dangerous branches that show evidence that they are likely to fall in normal weather conditions. It would be unreasonable to allow heavy pruning of a protected tree for the reason that one day there might be heavy winds and a branch may fall off.\r\nThe tree is the responsibility of the owners of 306 Liverpool Road and they have a duty of care to regularly inspect and apply pruning works as necessary for reasons of health and safety. This does not necessarily mean that pruning is needed after every inspection but if it is advised by a tree professional and the council agrees then the agreed works should be implemented."
