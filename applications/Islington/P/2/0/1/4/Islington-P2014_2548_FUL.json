    "REASON: The additional height from the proposed roof extension results in a building with incongruous and disproportionate relationship with the adjoining building at 171 Farringdon Road, causing unacceptable harm to the streetscene, the adjacent Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area, and setting of the adjacent Listed Building at 42 -44 Rosebery Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 12 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 (Design) and policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013 and guidance contained within the Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006."
