    "After consultation with the applicant, the original specification has been changed to lesser works and has followed the advice of the arboricultural consultants report. There was some confusion with the home insurer’s interpretation of the report.\r\nThe original specification of Ash (T5) reduce and there after maintain crown to approximately 7.6m’ was deemed inappropriate and detrimental to tree health. The proposed works would have led to a major loss of amenity to the tree and further cavities similar to the one at 2.5m above ground level."
