    "REASON: The proposed extension would substantially harm the significance of the listed building by virtue of its excessive size; incongruous design and materials; negative impact on original plan form, hierarchy of floors and circulation routes; raising of the garden space resulting in an inappropriate relationship between the building and its setting: and loss of all existing open garden space.  The proposed works are, therefore, contrary to Policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Sustaining and Enhancing the Significance of Heritage Assets) of the London Plan 2011 and Policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and Policy DM2.3."
