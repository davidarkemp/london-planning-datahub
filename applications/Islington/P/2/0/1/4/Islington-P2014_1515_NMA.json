    "CONDITION 8:  The energy efficiency measures/features and renewable regulated energy technology(s) (including solar PVs), shall include:\r\n\r\na) The CO2 reduction measures shall provide no less than both of the following on-site CO2 emission reductions, as compared to the calculated 2010 Building Regulations (Part L) CO2 emission baseline for the development:\r\n\r\n*  20.4% reduction in total CO2 emissions (regulated & unregulated); and\r\n*  38.6% reduction in regulated CO2 emissions.\r\n\r\nb) The CO2 reduction measures to meet these targets shall be those detailed in the following documents approved by the Local Planning Authority:\r\n\r\n*  ‘Energy & Sustainability Statement’ Issue 04 dated May 2014; and \r\n*  ‘Briefing Note: 207/211 Old Street’ Revision 01.\r\n\r\nc) The CO2 reduction measures shall be installed and operational within 24 months of first occupation of the development (with the exception of Empire House), unless otherwise specifically agreed by the Local Planning Authority.\r\n\r\nShould, following further assessment, the approved CO2 reduction measures be found to be no-longer suitable a revised Energy Statement setting out CO2 reduction measures, which shall provide for no less than 20.4% reduction in total CO2 emissions (regulated & unregulated) and 38.6% reduction in regulated CO2 emissions, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority within 24 months of first occupation of the development (with the exception of Empire House). The final agreed CO2 emission reduction measures shall be installed and operational within 24 months of first occupation of the development (with the exception of Empire House) of the development and shall be maintained as such thereafter.\r\n\r\nREASON: In the interest of sustainable development and to ensure that the Local Planning Authority may be satisfied that CO2 emission reduction targets are met."
