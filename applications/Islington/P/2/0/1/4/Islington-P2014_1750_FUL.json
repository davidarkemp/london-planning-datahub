    "REASON: The proposed replacement two-storey rear extension by virtue of its scale and massing and unsympathetic design fails to maintain an acceptable sense of subservience to the host building and causes harm to the character and appearance of the rear of the terrace and wider Newington Green Conservation Area and is therefore unacceptable. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 12 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), policy 7.8 (Sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan (2011), policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 (Design) and policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies (2013) and guidance contained within the Newington Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2014) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006)."
