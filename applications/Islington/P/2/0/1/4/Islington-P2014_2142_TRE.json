  "description": "Cherry: Retain lowest limb. The limb above this (.on the building side at 6m approx above ground level) can be removed as is smaller. In addition, ensure a 2-2.5m clearance from building and tree crown and crown lift sub-lateral branches to a height of 6m above ground level. (to allow more light to reach the floor)\r\n                        \r\nG2 2xSycamore: fell to ground level, but you may do less if you wish.\r\n                        \r\nT3 Elder: Cut back all overhang to the fence-line (or a little past this if you wish as long as the majority of the crown over the park can be retained) on Greenpeace side of the fence so that vehicles may pass safely through the driveway.",
