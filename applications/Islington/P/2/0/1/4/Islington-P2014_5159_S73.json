    "The proposal introduces a parapet wall to the side elevation of the dwelling that was not present on the previously approved drawings. This would increase the height of the side wall facing 85 and 87 Plimsoll Road, substantially increasing the sense of enclosure felt by these properties and reducing the amount of daylight received. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies CS7, DM 2.1, and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan"
