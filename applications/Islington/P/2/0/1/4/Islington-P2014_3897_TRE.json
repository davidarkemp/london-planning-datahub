Remove lower branches [epicormic shoots] to a height of 4-5 metres to improve clearance over grade.  Thin crown to remove approximately 20% of live branches to reduce crown density.  Most thinning cuts will be between 2 and 3 centimeters in diameter.  Reduce regrowth back to previous points by approximately 1 metre to manage volume.",
