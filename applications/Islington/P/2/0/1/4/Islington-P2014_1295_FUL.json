    "The proposed mansard roof extension, by reason of its height and massing, would represent an overly large, obtrusive and dominant roof addition that would be incongruous within the locality and would introduce a roof extension within a terrace that has an unaltered roofline and would therefore be harmful to the rhythm and integrity of the terraced row and the character and appearance of the conservation area. The proposed extension would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011), policy CS9 of Islingtonâ€™s Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and to the guidance in the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and the Highbury Fields Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
