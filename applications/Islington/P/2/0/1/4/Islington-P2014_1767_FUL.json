    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would be situated within a terrace that has an entirely uniform and unaltered rear roofline. The proposed roof extension would be harmful to the appearance of the host building, disrupt the rhythm and unity of the terrace of which is forms a part of, effect views from the private realm and oblique views from the surrounding streets. The development is contrary to policies 7.4 (Local character) and 7.6 (Architecture) of the London Plan 2011, policies CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islingtonâ€™s built and historic environment) of the Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013, and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2006 and in particular sections 2.4.2 (Protecting Unaltered Rooflines) and 2.4.3 (Rooflines with existing alterations/extensions)."
