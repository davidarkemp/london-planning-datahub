    "REASON: The proposed works would harm the heritage significance of the Grade II listed building by virtue of the loss of historic fabric which will adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and surrounding conservation area. The works would, therefore, cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 126 of policy 12 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2011, policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1(Design) and DM2.3(Heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within the Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002), Islington Urban Design Guide (2006) and London terraced Houses."
