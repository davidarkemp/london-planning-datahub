    "Informatives\r\n\r\n1) The original specification has been changed to lesser works after consultation with the agent as the works were deemed excessive by the council and would be detrimental to tree health. The original specification was ‘Crown reduce by 30%- Reducing vertical and horizontal branches by 2-3 metres all around to suitable growth points. Pruning such as this will be detrimental to a large mature tree and it will react by producing fast-growing vigorous shoots that will spoil the shape, allow less light through the tree, and result in a loss of amenity value of the tree.\r\nThe lesser works of ‘Crown reduction of up to 1.5m on all aspects to strong lateral growth points and to leave a flowing shape and cut back of branches to allow a 2-2.5m clearance from the rear elevation of the property and the roof and a crown thin of 10-15%’ are deemed to be appropriate and within good arboricultural practice.\r\n\r\n2) The address of the tree has been altered as the tree is in the rear garden of 1 Wilowbridge road and not 3 Willowbridge Road\r\n\r\n3) The removal of ivy on the stem will also improve light to the area and make the tree less imposing. This does not need permission to remove from the council but please be mindful of the planning condition concerning nesting birds at this time of year."
