    "The original specification for T2 (on application) Eucalyptus has been changed after consultation with the agent. Reduction back to previous points of reduction would have led to the tree being reduced by up to 8m in height (up to 50% height reduction). This was deemed excessive without a sound arboricultural justification. The specification has been reduced to take into consideration the local concerns whilst keeping the tree in a healthy condition."
