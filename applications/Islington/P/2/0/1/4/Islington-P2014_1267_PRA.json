Additionally, the proposed form of development does not refer to a ground floor rear extension (but a ground floor side extension) and therefore would not be eligible to the amended permitted development allowance by virtue of Part 4, Paragraph A.1 (ea) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2013."
