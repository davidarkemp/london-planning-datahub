The proposed outbuilding would not constitute a detached structure and is therefore assessed under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, as amended. The entire projection of both the extension, the 'shed' and the 'outbuilding' exceed the permitted depth of 3.00 metres for ground floor rear extensions; therefore, it is recommended that the certificate is not issued."
