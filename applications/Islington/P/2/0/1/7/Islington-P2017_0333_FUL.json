    "REASON: In the absence of evidence to the contrary, based on the submitted documents, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed works do not result in a loss of A1 floorspace within a Primary Retail Frontage, designated Finsbury Park Town Centre and Specialist Shopping Area.  As such the proposal would have a harmful effect on the predominantly retail function and character of the Town Centre, and its vitality and viability, and affect the unique function of a specialist shopping area. The proposals are therefore contrary to policies DM4.4, DM4.5 and DM4.9 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013)."
