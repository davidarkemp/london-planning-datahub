  "description": "T1 False Acacia x 1 (Robinia pseudoacacia) Mature tree. The tree was wind thrown in the recent storms. The primary cause of this was mechanical loading on a heavily decayed root system. The tree is covered in Ganoderma pfeifferi fungal brackets. This fungus causes a parasitic, dignifying white rot that decays the roots and butt and can lead to wind throw. The tree is caught up in two other trees. This is a complex removal. The suggested works are: To fell to ground level.",
