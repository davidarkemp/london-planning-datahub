    "REASON: It is considered that there is insufficient evidence to reliably confirm on the balance of probability that the property known as 'City Snacks' at ground and lower ground floors, 39 Clerkenwell Road, LONDON, EC1M 5RS, has been in use as A3 use for a continuous period of ten or more years prior to the date of this application. The use of the premises as A3 (Restaurant and Cafe) therefore cannot be established under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended in section 171B."
