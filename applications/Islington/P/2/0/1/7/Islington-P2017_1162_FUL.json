    "REASON: The proposed upper ground floor extension by reason of its inappropriate design and excessive, scale massing and bulk are considered to constitute a dominant and discordant form of development that would fail to be subservient to the host property and would detract form the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016); Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington's Development Management (2013); Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and the advice in the Hillmarton Conservation Area Guidelines."
