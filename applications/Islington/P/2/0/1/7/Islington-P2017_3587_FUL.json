    "REASON: The proposal to replace existing timber sash windows with uVPC framed windows on the front elevation of Flat 3 by reason of its design and inappropriate materials would cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host building, its wider terrace as well as St. Johns Grove Conservation Area. The proposal is thus contrary to policies DM2.1 (Design) and DM 2.3 (Heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies, Islington's Urban Design Guide para. 5.127 and the Conservation Area Appraisal part 28.7 and 28.8 all of which seek to conserve and enhance the appearance and character of the Borough's Conservation Areas."
