    "To assist applicants the Local Planning Authority has produced policies and written guidance, all of which is available on the Councilâ€™s website. \r\n\r\n\r\nNo pre-application discussions were entered into. On receipt, the scheme did not comply with policy or guidance due to the principle of the roof extension upon an uninterupted roofline within a designated conservation area. This was therefore unacceptable in principle and negotiations with the applicant would not have led to a different decision in this instance.  \r\n\r\nThe LPA delivered the decision in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of the NPPF."
