    "INFORMATIVE: The proposed plans show the creation of a studio unit to  the lower ground floor which could be formally separated from the main dwellinghouse.  This was not applied for as part of this application (i.e. change of use application to convert the property into self-contained flats) and has therefore not been included in the description of development nor has it been consulted on.  \r\n\r\nThe creation of a new housing unit would require the payment of Â£50, 000 sought by the Islington Affordable Housing Small Sites Contributions SPD or to submit an agreed viability assessment to demonstrate that the full contribution is not viable and that instead a lesser contribution should be made. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies CS10 and CS12\r\nPart G of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, and the Islington Affordable Housing Small Sites Contributions SPD."
