    "Reason for refusal: The proposed alterations to the previous approved development are considered to create excessively bulky, visually dominant and poor features to the development. The proposed rear first floor roof terrace would also form a dominant and oppressive feature in close proximity to adjoining occupiers rear elevations with a loss of privacy and overlooking to these residents. The development would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and its wider conservation setting.  The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Core Strategy policy 9, DM policies 2.1 & 2.3, Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2017, Newington Green Conservation Area Guidance note and the NPPF."
