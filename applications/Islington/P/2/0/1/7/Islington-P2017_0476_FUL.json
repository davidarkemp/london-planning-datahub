    "REASON: The proposal results in the harmful loss of the original York Stone Slab base to the first floor balcony and the use of a concrete slab results in an inappropriate use of materials, which fails to respect the historic fabric of the Listed Building and surrounding conservation area. The proposed works therefore, harm the significance of the heritage asset and are unacceptable, contrary to Policy 12 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), Policy 7.8 (Sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan (2015), Policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and Policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies (2013)."
