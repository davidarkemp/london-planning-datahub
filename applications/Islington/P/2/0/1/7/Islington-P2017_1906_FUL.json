    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, height, bulk, and massing would result in an excessively large addition that fails to remain subordinate to the host building or respect the character and appearance of the surrounding conservation area. Consequently, the proposal would result in significant harm to the character and appearance of the host building, and the surrounding conservation area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to 7.4 (Local character), and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), Newington Green Conservation Area Statement (2014) and the Urban Design Guide SPD (2017)."
