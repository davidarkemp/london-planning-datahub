The proposal entails the demolition of the existing basement garage extension - front and section of party wall - as well as access driveway and includes extending the frontage to form an additional studio/ bedroom opening out onto an enclosed sunken courtyard in place of the present driveway. The new converted and extended area will link directly to the existing Flat D directly above via an internal staircase. Landscaping of the front garden is included in the proposal with new hedges and railings as well as an enclosed bin store with timber doors to look as gates between the existing piers of the old drive. as an annex to flat D to be used by the owners and occasional guests. There will be a separate front door adjacent to the entrance to the remaining flats, and access from Flat D will be through this external link.",
