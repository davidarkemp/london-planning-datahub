    "REASON: The proposed works lowering of the garden level, widening of the original opening to the rear elevation at lower ground floor level and alterations to the plan form at second floor level associated with the proposed new bathroom by virtue of their detrimental impact on the historic plan form and unsympathetic design would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to policy 12 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington’s built and historic environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington’s Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within English Heritage’s ‘London Terraced Houses 1660-1860’."
