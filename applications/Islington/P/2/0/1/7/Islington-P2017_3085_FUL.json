    "REASON: The proposed three storey rear extension by reason of its excessive height, design, bulk, scale, depth and massing would form a dominant, discordant and visually harmful addition which would subsume the host building and fails to appear subordinate to its original design. Due to its visibility from public and private realm, it would also have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Polices (2013) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
