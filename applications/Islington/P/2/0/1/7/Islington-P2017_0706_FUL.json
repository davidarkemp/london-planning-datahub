    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of their inappropriate design, siting, scale and undue prominence coupled with the loss of the existing sloped rear roof form would form a discordant and harmful visual feature when seen from the surrounding private realm. The development would disrupt the symmetry of the pair of terrace properties to the rear and would undermine the overall existing unity and uniformity towards the rear of the host property and wider terrace setting which are considered to be positive visual features in this case.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
