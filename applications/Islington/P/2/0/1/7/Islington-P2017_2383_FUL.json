    "REASON 01: The proposed rear extensions by reason of their overall inappropriate detailed design, form, materials and final appearance would form a dominant and inharmonious addition to the host property and the existing attractive symmetry of the pair of villas, and would form a detrimental feature when seen from the surrounding public and private realm failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding conservation area. The proposed addition would subsume the rear ground floor elevation of the host building in a clear visually harmful manner. The proposal would fail to comply with the provisions of section 12 of the NPPF, and policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Polices (2013), Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and Highbury New Park Conservation Area Design Guide (2002)."
