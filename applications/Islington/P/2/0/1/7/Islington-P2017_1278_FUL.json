    "REASON: The proposed roof extensions are considered to form a dominant and discordant feature which would severely interrupt the existing predominantly unaltered roofline which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the locally listed host buildings, wider terrace setting and the surrounding Keystone Crescent conservation area. The proposed development is considered to be contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy (2011); DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management policies 2013, the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Keystone Crescent Conservation Area."
