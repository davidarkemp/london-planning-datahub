    "REASON: Due to its height, bulk, and massing, together with its inappropriate design, and visibility from both the public and private realm, the proposed roof extension would disrupt the existing rhythm and consistency within the terrace and appear as an incongruous addition that fails to respect the character and appearance of the host building, the adjoining terrace and the surrounding conservation area. Consequently, the proposal would result in significant harm to the character and appearance of the host building, the streetscene and the surrounding conservation area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to 7.4 (Local character), and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and the Urban Design Guide SPD (2017)."
