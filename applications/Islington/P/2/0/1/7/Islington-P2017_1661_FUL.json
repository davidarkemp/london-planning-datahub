    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of its excessive design, scale, massing, height and siting and unacceptable and harmful visibility from both the public and private realm, the proposed development is considered to form a discordant and dominant feature when seen within its context. The proposed roof extension would disrupt the existing rhythm and consistency within the terrace that fails to respect the character and appearance of the host building, the adjoining terrace and the surrounding conservation area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to 7.4 (Local character), and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and the Urban Design Guide SPD (2017)."
