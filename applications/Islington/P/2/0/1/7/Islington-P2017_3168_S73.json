    "REASON: The proposal to utilise the existing student accommodation for visitor accommodation for short term lets for 13 weeks (25%) of the calendar year, would introduce a hotel use outside of the appropriate locations for visitor accommodation identified by the hierarchy set out in Policy DM4.11(A). The application fails to adequately demonstrate how the hotel use would contribute positively to the balance and mix of uses in the immediate locality including by virtue of over concentration. The application fails to safeguard purpose built student accommodation. The proposal is therefore unacceptable and contrary to policy 4.5 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS 14 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM3.9 and DM4.11 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013)."
