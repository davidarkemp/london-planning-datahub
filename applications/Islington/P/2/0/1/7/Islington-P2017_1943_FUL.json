    "REASON: The proposed front extension and associated works including new side boundary wall, and creation of front patio area would result in a wholly inappropriate and incongruous form of development due to its positioning in front of the established building line. Its overall design, scale, bulk, massing and use of materials would be entirely out of keeping with the host building and the surrounding  street scene. It would therefore detract from the character and appearance of Hillmarton Conservation Area and contrary to 7.4 (Local character), and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and the Urban Design Guide SPD (2017)."
