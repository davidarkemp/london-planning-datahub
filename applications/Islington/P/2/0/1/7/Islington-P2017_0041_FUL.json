    "REASON: The proposed roof extension and raised flank wall by reason of inappropriate design, scale, bulk and final appearance would form an over-dominant feature when seen from the rear and from Ashmount Road, which is considered to be harmful to the character and appearance of the host property and the wider conservation area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 (Enhancing Islington's Character) and CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy (2011) DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management policies 2013, the Whitehall Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Islington Urban Design Guidelines 2017."
