    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would appear as an alien and discordant feature with inappropriate form and design that would disrupt the rhythm and uniformity of the largely unbroken terrace roofline within the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore detrimentally harm the character and appearance of the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area contrary to policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, policies CS8 and  CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and the NPPF, and the guidance in the Islington Urban Design Guidelines 2017 and the Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
