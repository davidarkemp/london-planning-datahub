    "REASON: The Local Planning Authority is not satisfied, on the basis of the evidence submitted, that it has been adequately established through this application that the premises at 3 Mayton Street has been used as three self-contained residential flats (Use Class C3) for a continuous period of 4 years prior to the date of this application. The lawful use as three self-contained flats therefore cannot be established under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as amended in section 171(b) (1)."
