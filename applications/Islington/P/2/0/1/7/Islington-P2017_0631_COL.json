    "REASON: The evidence submitted with the application documents, as well as internet research and a site visit, suggests the use of the ground floor unit is a sui generis use (jewellers and pawnbrokers). However on the balance of probablility, the lack of evidence submitted with the application documents as well as Internet research and a site visit fails to demonstrate the use of the first to third floors as a separate planning unit in use as Class B1(a) offices."
