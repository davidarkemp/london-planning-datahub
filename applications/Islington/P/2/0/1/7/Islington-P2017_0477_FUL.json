    "REASON: Due to the inappropriate design, scale, bulk and massing, the proposed roof extension results in an excessively prominent and awkward addition which fails to remain sympathetic to the host building and introduces features that fail to respect the scale, form, and character of the street frontage. The proposal is therefore unacceptable and contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2015); policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy (2011), policy DM2.1 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), and guidance within the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
