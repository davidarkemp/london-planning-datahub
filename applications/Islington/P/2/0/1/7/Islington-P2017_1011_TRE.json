    "REASON:\r\n\r\n(i) On the basis of loss of a visual amenity. The trees are located in a prominent location and make an important landscape contribution to the Aberdeen Park Conservation Area which is supported by Policy DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013).\r\n\r\n(ii) On the basis that you failed to supply sufficient arboricultural evidence to satisfy the Council that the trees are not stable and are too inappropriate (to large) for their location. The trees has been previously maintained at reduced dimensions which if repeated will maintain the crown of the tree at an acceptable size in relation with the nearby properties. The pruning of trees in Conservation Areas is a common practice in retaining trees near properties and therefore the proposed removal is not considered justified. The Council would look favourably on a future appropriate tree pruning specification.\r\n\r\n(iii) On the basis that you have failed to supply insufficient technical evidence to satisfy the Council in respect to damage to light structures including possible design solutions to include for tree retention and light structure repairs."
