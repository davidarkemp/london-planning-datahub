    "REASON: The proposed two storey extension by virtue of its excessive design, scale, siting, height, massing and bulk would fail to be subordinate to the host property and would form a visually dominant and discordant feature in visual terms when seen form the surrounding public and private realm. The proposed development be unacceptable in design terms, as it would clearly harm the visual appearance and character of the host building and wider terrace setting. It would therefore fail to comply with Islington Core Strategy 2011 policies CS8 and CS9, Development Management Policy 2013 DM2.1, Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017) and The NPPF."
