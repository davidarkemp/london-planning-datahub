The application also proposes the addition of a condition requiring the submission and approval of a Non-Student Management Plan prior to occupation by persons other than students. Modification of Schedule 1 of the Section 106 Agreement dated 21st November 2008 (as varied by two deeds of variation dated 16 March 2009 and 2 October 2009) to amend the obligations that restrict occupation of two of the Student Dwellings to be limited to the academic term.",

    "REASON: The proposal to utilise the existing student accommodation for visitor accommodation for short term lets for 13 weeks (25%) of the calendar year, would introduce a hotel use outside of the appropriate locations for visitor accommodation identified by the hierarchy set out in Policy DM4.11(A). The application fails to adequately demonstrate how the hotel use would contribute positively to the balance and mix of uses in the immediate locality including by virtue of over concentration. The application fails to safeguard purpose built student accommodation. The proposal is therefore unacceptable and contrary to policy 4.5 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS 14 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM3.9 and DM4.11 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013)."
