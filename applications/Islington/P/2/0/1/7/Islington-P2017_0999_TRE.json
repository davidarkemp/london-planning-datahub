    "REASON:\r\n\r\n(i) On the basis of loss of a visual amenity. The tree is located in a prominent location and makes an important landscape contribution to the Canonbury Conservation Area and is supported by Policy DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013).\r\n\r\n(ii) On the basis that you have failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree is inappropriate for its location. The tree has been previously maintained at reduced dimensions which if repeated will maintain the crown of the tree at an acceptable size in relation with the nearby property. The pruning of trees in Conservation Areas is a common practice in retaining trees near properties and therefore the proposed removal is not considered justified. The Council would look favourably on a future appropriate tree pruning specification."
