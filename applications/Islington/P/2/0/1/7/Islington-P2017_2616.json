  "description": "Parkland View is a block of 9 flats, built in 1995 and owned by Circle 33 Housing Association. The three-storey block was built with permissions on an area with Tree Preservation Orders in place from 1986 (LBI TPO (NO.71). A number of the trees within the boundary of the property are causing ongoing issues for the residents within the block. The back of the property has three individual gardens, all three of which have mature sycamore that have grown to height that exceed the property roof, and if not maintained regularly, touch the side of the building and drop leaves into the guttering, which then needs to be cleared. It is an ongoing issue for the residents to arrange maintenance, which is time consuming and costly. The five sycamores in the back of the property block out the majority of light in the gardens. Equally, a species of hawthorn and a number of robina trees are not flourishing under the canopy of the large sycamores. The large sycamore at the front right of the property is very close to the building and has caused structural issues for the resident of Flat 9, where leaves have blocked guttering and caused rain penetration into the property and subsequent damp and mould. There is potentially disease in the tree which threatens the health and safety of residents in the block, which contains elderly and young children under 5. Ongoing maintenance of the trees, clearance of guttering and rectifying associated damage has been and is very costly therefore residents are seeking for a number of sycamore to be felled. Islington's Tree Officer (Gavin Rees) met with residents for a site visit and to discuss the issues, who recommended we complete this application as agreed a number of trees were too close to the building and could potentially be felled. An outline of the property and trees has been provided with this application. Residents are open to planting a replacement tree in place of the sycamore (front right) if required.",
