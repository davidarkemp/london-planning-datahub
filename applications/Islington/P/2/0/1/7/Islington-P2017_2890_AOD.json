    "Please also note the following points relating to the Tree Protection Plan:\r\n\r\n1. Whilst the content of the AMS and Tree Protection Plan is acceptable the requirement for continued arboricultural supervision at critical stages of the project (see section 2.26) is on-going as is the need for the contractor to ensure compliance with the recommendations contained within the report and associated Tree Protection Plan.\r\n\r\n2. Further Arboricultural input will be required by the project arboricultural consultant when the location of new services for the Heritage Centre are designed, these will need to be routed so as to mitigate damage to retained trees.\r\n\r\n3. Further to section 2.26 of the AMS, a brief site report (including photos) will be issued to the Planning Officer and Greenspace Tree Officers confirming compliance, this will need to be issued at key stages of site development that has the potential to cause significant tree damage (as specified within the AMS)."
