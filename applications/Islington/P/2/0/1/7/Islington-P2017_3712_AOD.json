    "The information submitted by the Developer to Thames Water show that the proposed piling works are within the 3m exclusion zone for Thames Water assets. Drawing CH02 Rev. H dated 29.09.2016 indicated that piles are 2.5m away from the sewer and 2m from the MH0805 and as such, negligible impact is expected as a result of the proposed piling works. However, the proposed piling works are within the 3m exclusion zone of an existing sewer. Therefore, these piling works may only proceed with a buildover/close agreement in place, for which the Developer has to apply online at: https://developers.thameswater.co.uk/Domestic-and-small-commercial/Building-near-pipes/Building-over-or-near-a-sewer/Build-over-a-public-sewer-application/Apply-to-build-over-a-sewer \r\n\r\nPlease see the guidance document 'Working Near Our Assets' available at the following link for more details on Thames Water policy with regards to piling, demolition, excavation and abnormal loading: (available online at https://developers.thameswater.co.uk/developing-a-large-site/planning-your-development/working-near-or-diverting-our-pipes ).\r\n\r\nPlease bear in mind that Thames Water will hold the developer and any relevant contractor/sub-contractor liable for any losses incurred or damage caused to Thames Water assets arising from construction works or subsequent use of the facility."
