    "REASON: The proposed extension above the existing rear addition  by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing, bulk and height is considered to form a visually dominant and discordant feature which would fail to be a subservient addition to the host building and wider terrace setting. The proposal is considered to be out of scale with existing and surrounding built form and would have an adverse effect on the appearance of the host property and wider Keystone Crescent Conservation Area when viewed from the private realm and is therefore considered to be contrary to the Islington Core Strategy 2011 Policies CS8 and CS9, DM policies 2.1 and Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and Keystone Crescent Crescent Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
