    "The proposed development, by reason of its inappropriate layout, height, massing and proximity to facing residential properties would result in an unacceptable harm to the amenity of nearby residential buildings through loss of daylight and sunlight receipt experienced by those properties, loss of outlook and sense of enclosure. This harm makes the proposal contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DM 2.1 of Islington's Local Plan: Development Management Policies (2013), as well as BRE 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice' (Second Edition 2011)\" and the benefits of the scheme are not considered to outweigh this harm."
