    "REASON: The proposed extension by reason of its excessive and inappropriate design, height, bulk and proportions is considered to form a dominant and discordant form of development which would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the existing building, the streetscene and setting of the adjacent Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore unacceptable, contrary to policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011), policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013), Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area Design Guide (2002) and Islington's Urban Design Guidelines (2017)."
