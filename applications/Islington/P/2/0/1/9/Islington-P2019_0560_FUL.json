    "REASON: The proposed replacement front elevation UPVC windows are unacceptable by virtue of their poor quality design, thickness, inappropriate materials, appearance and method of opening which would form a visually discordant feature when seen from the surrounding public realm that would harm the architectural character, appearance and integrity of the host building and would harm the visual amenity of the area.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy 12 of the NPPF, policy CS9 of the Core Strategy and policy DM2.1 the Development Management Policies including the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide."
