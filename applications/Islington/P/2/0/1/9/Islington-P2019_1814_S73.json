    "Reason for Refusal: The proposed alterations to the previous approved development are considered to create excessively bulky, visually dominant and poor features to the development. The proposed rear first floor roof terrace with full height and full width timber panelling would also form a dominant and oppressive feature in close proximity to adjoining occupiers rear elevations. The development would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and its wider conservation setting.  The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Core Strategy policy 9, DM policies 2.1 & 2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2017, the Newington Green Conservation Area Guidance and the NPPF 2019."
