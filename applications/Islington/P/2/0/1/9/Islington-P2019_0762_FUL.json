    "REASON: The proposed extension over the roof of the existing two storey outrigger by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, bulk, massing and height would form a dominant and harmful addition to the rear of the host property and wider terrace setting. The development would be readily visible from the surrounding private realm and would clearly fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and wider Whitehall Park CA.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013. It also contravenes the guidance within the Whitehall Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the NPPF 2019."
