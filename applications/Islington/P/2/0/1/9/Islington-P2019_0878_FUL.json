    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing and bulk would form a dominant and discordant addition to host terrace. The proposed roof extension by reason of its non-traditional design would cause clear visual harm when viewed from the surrounding public and private realm. The development is therefore considered to fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and the wider setting of the terrace. The development is therefore contrary to CS policy 9, Development Management Policy DM2.1, Islington's Urban Design Guidance and the NPPF 2019."
