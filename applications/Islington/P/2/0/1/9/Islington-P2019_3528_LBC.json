    "REASON 01: In line with Section 16(2) and 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, in assessing the proposals hereby under consideration, special regard has been given to the desirability of preserving the listed building, its setting and any of its features of special architectural or historic interest, and the character and appearance of the conservation area.\r\n\r\nThe proposed works would be detrimental to the design and appearance of the listed building and so would adversely affect the special architectural and historic interest of heritage asset, and would not preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area. The works would therefore cause harm to the significance of the designated heritage assets, contrary to the objectives of Chapter 16 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, Policy 7.8 (Sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets) of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS9 (Protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and Policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
