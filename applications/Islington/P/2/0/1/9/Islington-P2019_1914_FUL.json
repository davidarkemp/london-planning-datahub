    "REASON: The proposal would result in the unjustified loss of business floor space. No marketing evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the property has been adequately marketed for a period of at least two-years, nor has a market demand analysis been submitted to justify the insufficient marketing evidence provided. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy CS13 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM5.2 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and Policy B3 of the Draft Islington Local Plan 2019."
