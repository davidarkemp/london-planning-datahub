    "REASON: Due to their inappropriate siting and appearance, the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as dominant and discordant additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location, and would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the locally listed host building and Newington Green Conservation Area. The public benefit of the equipment is not considered to outweigh the harm caused to the heritage assets. For this reason, the proposal is contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework (2019) (NPPF) together with policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016,  CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1,  DM2.3 and DM2,7 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the guidance contained within the Newington Green Conservation Statement (2014) and the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
