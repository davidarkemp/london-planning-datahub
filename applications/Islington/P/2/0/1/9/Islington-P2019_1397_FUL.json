    "REASON: The proposed first floor extension, by reason of its depth, height, and proximity to other residential properties would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of adjacent and nearby residentail buildings through overbearing and harm to outlook.  The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that there will not be any impact on adjacent and nearby residential buildings through loss of daylight and sunlight. The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan Policy 7.6, Policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), as well as BRE 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice' (Second Edition 2011)."
