    "REASON: The proposed telephone mast would be an intrusive feature and would be out of scale to the streetscene. The siting and apperance of the proposal would therefore harm the visual amenity of the area contrary to DM 2.1 and  DM 2.7 of the DM Policies 2013 and failing to comply with the requirments  of Schedule 2, Part 16, Class A. 3 (3)  of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015.  It is therefore considered that the proposal is not permitted development and planning permission is required from the Local Planning Authority."
