It would cause harm to the character and appearance of the New River Conservation Area and settting of nearby Listed Buildings. The development is therefore contrary to Chapter 16 of the NPPF 2018, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, the Conservation Area Guidelines and the Urban Design Guide 2017."
