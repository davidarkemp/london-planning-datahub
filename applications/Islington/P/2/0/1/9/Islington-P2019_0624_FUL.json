    "REASON: The proposed rear dormer would unacceptably interrupt the existing predominantly unaltered roofline which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace setting and the surrounding Newington Green Conservation Area. The proposed roof extension and its overall design, scale, massing and prominent siting would form a dominant and discordant feature when seen from the private realm that would disrupt the rear roof form of the host property, wider terrace and conservation area. The proposed development is considered to be contrary to policy 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management policies 2013, the Newington Green Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017)."
