Therefore, the proposed amendments are unacceptable, contrary to policies DM2.1 and DM2.2 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the Inclusive Design in Islington Supplementary Planning Document (February 2014).  As such, the proposed amendments would not constitute a non-material amendment and are unacceptable in planning terms."
