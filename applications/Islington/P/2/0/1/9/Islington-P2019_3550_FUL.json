    "REASON: The proposed first floor side extension is considered to be an unacceptable form of development by reason of its prominent siting, design, scale, massing and form would form a dominant and discordant addition to the host property, semi -detached pair and wider Conservation Area setting.  It would erode the intrinsic spacious and open gaps at first floor level apparent on similar styled semi-detached villas in the surrounding area and would disrupt unacceptably the existing symmetry of the pair of properties in this case. The development would be readily visible form the surrounding public realm and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property, wider semi-detached pair and wider Canonbury Conservation Area. The proposal would be contrary to policy 12 of the NPPF, policies 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2015; policy CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011; policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Islington Urban Design Guide."
