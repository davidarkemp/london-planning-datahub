    "INFORMATIVE: It has been highlighted that the eaves of this property have been the site of a swifts' nest site every year for at least 24 years. \r\n\r\nIt is also recorded on the national RSPB swifts survey website. Swifts are on the RSPB amber list due to rapidly declining numbers, a reduction of 25% in the last 5 years. Swifts are site-faithful and will return to the same nest site each year.\n\nIt is therefore important that the nest site is protected during the breeding season (May to August inclusive), as scaffolding during this period will prevent the swifts from entering their nest.\r\n\r\n\nPlease contact the RSPB or a suitable qualified expert prior to making a resubmission regarding this matter and nest site protection, along with the addition of either external or integrated swifts nestboxes at eaves leve lto provide a long-term resource to protect this species."
