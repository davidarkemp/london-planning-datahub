    "The application does not include suitable air quality mitigation measures and thereby fails to adequately demonstrate how the proposed development would address the potential to cause relevant exposure to air pollution levels exceeding the national air quality objectives.  The submitted air quality report fails to adequately detail the area within the boundary of the site, which may exceed relevant national air quality objectives and specify how the detailed application will address any potential to cause relevant exposure to air pollution levels exceeding the national air quality objectives. In addition, the submission fails to identify areas of potential exposure. Finally, the Councils Public Protection team have also advised that the applicants have failed to undertake an Air Quality Neutral assessment, therefore refusal of this details application is recommended.  The proposed details therefore fail to comply with London Plan Policy 7.14 (Improving Air Quality) and Policy DM6.1 of the Council's Development Management Policies document."
