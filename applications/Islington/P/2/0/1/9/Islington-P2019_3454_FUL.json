    "REASON: The conversion would fail to provide an adequate standard of accommodation for occupiers of the units by reason of undersize and cramped internal living environments; poor or no outlook, aspect or daylight to the main living spaces; lack of private outdoor amenity space and lack of privacy through the rooflights. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that there will be sufficient daylight/sunlight within the units.   The conversion would also result in the loss of a larger home and there are no exceptional circumstances to justify the provision of 100% non-priority dwelling mix units . It is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D6 and H10 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS12 of the Core Strategy (2011),  Policies DM3.3, DM3.4 and DM3.5 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and policies H1, H2, H4 and H5 of the Draft Local Plan."
