It would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the Canonbury Conservation Area, contrary to CS policies 8 & 9, policy DM 2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016,  Islington's Urban Design Guidance 2017 and the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
