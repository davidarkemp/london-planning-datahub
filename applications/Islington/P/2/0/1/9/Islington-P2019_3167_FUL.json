    "Reason: The proposed lowering of the front lightwell, associated alterations to the front lightwell and overall detailed design and appearance of the proposed rear extension would form discordant and incongruous features to the front and rear of host property, wider terrace setting and surrounding conservation area. The developments would fail to harmonise with the surrounding built form and would be visible from the public and private realm causing clear harm to the surrounding conservation area. The proposals are therefore contrary to the objectives of the NPPF 2019, policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, the Urban Design Guide 2017, the Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area Guidelines and Islington's Basement Development SPD 2016."
