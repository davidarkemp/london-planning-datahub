The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage assets contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, and guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
