    "REASON: The proposed bi-folding doors with juliet balcony at the first floor flank elevation fronting Barnsbury Square, by reason of their excessive size and inappropriate appearance and prominent siting would introduce discordant and incongruous features to the host property and wider conservation area. The development would jarr with the surrounding urban context and would be readily visible from the surrounding public realm.  It would therefore be contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 & DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
