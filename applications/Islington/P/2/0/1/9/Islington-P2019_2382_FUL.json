    "Reason : 1 - REASON: The proposed development would cause an unjustified loss of ancillary A1 retail floorspace without any substantive two-year marketing evidence submitted to the Local Planning Authority nor a two-year vacancy period displayed to justify this commercial loss. The proposal would therefore have a detrimental impact on the safeguarding of valuable A1 floorspace within a designated Town Centre and undermine the retail provision within this centre. The proposed development provide is considered to be contrary to London Plan Policy 2.15, policies DM4.4, DM4.5 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011 and the NPPF 2019. ",
    "Reason : 2 - REASON: The proposed lack of an appropriate mix, over provision of family accommodation with a distinct lack of adequate and functional amenity space within a densely developed Town Centre location fails to provide a satisfactory quality of accommodation for future occupiers The proposals are therefore contrary to London Plan Policy 3.5 (Quality and design of housing developments) and policies 3.4 & 3.5 of Development Management Policies 2013 and the NPPF 2019."
