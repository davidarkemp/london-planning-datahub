    "REASON: Due to its scale, bulk, massing and general design, including its projection, the three storey dwelling would fail to preserve the visual appearance and historic character of the host building and result in harm to the New River Conservation Area and the setting of the adjacent Grade II listed terrace (nos. 18-21 Wilmington Square). It is therefore unacceptable in design terms and contrary to the policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011) and DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Development Management Policies 2013, and the advice found within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and New River Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
