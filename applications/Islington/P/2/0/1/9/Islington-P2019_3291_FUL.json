    "REASON: The proposed development by reason of the inappropriate design of the works to the rear elevation  would form a discordant rear fenestration to the host building and an imbalance between the pair of buildings (4 and 6 Lamb's Mews). The alterations would be readily visible from the surrounding private and public realm and would cause harm to the host building, the street scene and the wider conservation area. It would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.8  of the London Plan (2016), policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policy 2013 and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
