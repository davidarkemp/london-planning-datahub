    "REASON: The proposal due to its design, form, materiality and poor layout, fails to relate to the context and local character, lacks coherence with the surrounding predominant form of development in the area. Therefore the proposal is considered to fail to pay special regard to preserving the visual appearance and historic character of the setting of the Tollington Park Conservation Area and is unacceptable in design terms, contrary to Islington Core Strategy (2011) CS8 and CS9 and DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Development Management Policies (2013) and the design advice found within the Islington Urban Design Guide (2017) and Tollington Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
