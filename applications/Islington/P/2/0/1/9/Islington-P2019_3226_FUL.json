The works would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of the Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1(Design) and DM2.3 (Heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013 and guidance contained within Islington's Urban Design Guide Guidelines 2017."
