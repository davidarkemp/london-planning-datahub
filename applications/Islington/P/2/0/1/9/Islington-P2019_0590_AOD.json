    "The applicant is advised that Transport for London have the following further comments:\r\n-  Any deliveries outside the standard delivery hours (09:30-16:00) will need additional risk assessment and may need further measures. The suspension of the existing loading bay would be at TfL's discretion and would require Temporary Traffic Order restricting stopping and loading in this area;\r\n-  TfL notes that the existing loading bay operates between 10am and 4pm (Mon-Sat) only. LGV deliveries should only take place within these hours.\r\n-  For the TMAN process, the CLP should be up-to-date taken account of TfL's guidance;\r\n-  For avoidance of doubt, any works to vertical obstructions identified on the TLRN would need to be agreed with TfL. We would be concerned about HGVs hitting existing TfL infrastructure. As part of the CLP, the freight operator would need to access this risk.\r\n-  We note the northbound carriageway remains 4.66m throughout construction which is welcomed. We note the southbound carriageway may narrow down to 2.80m which appears to be sufficient for buses going southbound, however, it would be prudent to provide swept paths of buses coming along Seven Sisters Road.\r\n-  Anything that cantilevers or oversails our highway will need TfL's approval, including the footway. TfL's concern would be to make sure the scaffolding is safe and doesn't create an obstruction.\r\n-  We welcome that evidence of compliance to CLOCS standards and FORS silver membership will be provided."
