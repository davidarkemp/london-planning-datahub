The proposed development is considered to be contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management policies 2013, the Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
