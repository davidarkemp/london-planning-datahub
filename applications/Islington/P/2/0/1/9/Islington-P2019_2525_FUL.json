    "REASON: The proposed roof extension and rear terraces, by reason of their inappropriate detailed design, appearance, materiality, and loss of the historic butterfly parapet, would both individually and cumulatively introduce dominant and discordant, incongruous features to the host building that would be visible in public sightlines. The proposed development would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and wider streetscene, to the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area.  It would therefore be contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
