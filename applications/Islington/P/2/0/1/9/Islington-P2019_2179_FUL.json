    "REASON: The proposed extension over first and second ectension by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, massing and height would form a dominant and harmful addition to the rear of the host property and wider terrace setting. The development would be readily visible from the surrounding private realm and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and wider terrace row.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013. It also contravenes the guidance within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the NPPF 2019."
