The proposed extension would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host building, streetscene and the Highbury Fields Conservation Area contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
