    "CONDITION: The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, massing and appearance would form a discordant feature to the rear of building. The proposal would cause visual harm to the architectural integrity of the host building and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the existing Grade II Listed building nor its setting within the wider listed terrace and surrounding Upper Street North Conservation Area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
