    "Reason:  In terminating close to the eaves of the main building the proposed side extension at second floor level fails to be appropriately subordinate, will result in the unacceptable infilling of an important gap between properties, inappropriately alter the original form of fa√ßade and undermine the architectural integrity of the listed building.  The infilling of the important gap will lead to an inappropriate terracing effect and visually harm the listed group.  Consequently, the proposed works would unacceptably harm the significance of the heritage assets (listed building, listed group).  The proposed works are, therefore, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Sustaining and Enhancing the Significance of Heritage Assets) of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of the Islington Development Management Policies (2013)."
