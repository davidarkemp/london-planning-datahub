    "REASON: The proposed works by virtue of their inappropriate scale, detailed design and inappropriate use of materials would have detrimental impact on the setting of the identified listed buildings, and the unsympathetic design would adversely affect the special character and appearance of the New River Conservation Area. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the designated heritage assets contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
