    "Reason: The proposed two storey roof extension, 5 storey rear extension and rear extension staircase by reason of their inappropriate detailed design, scale, bulk, massing, and height would form dominant and discordant additions to the host property and wider terrace. The building would be subsumed unacceptably in a visually harmful manner. The proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building, wider terrace setting and its wider setting within Clerkenwell Green Conservation area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2019), policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), the Urban Design Guide (2017) and Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area Guidelines (2002)."
