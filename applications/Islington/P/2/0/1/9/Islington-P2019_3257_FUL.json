    "REASON: Due to its position to the front garden, its visual prominence from street level, the proposal would fail to pay special regard in preserving the visual appearance and historic character of the host building and wider area and would result in less than substantial harm to the Whitehall Park Conservation Area, and there are no public benefits to outweigh this harm. It is therefore contrary to the design advice found within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and Whitehall Park Conservation Area Design Guidelines and policies CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy (2011) and DM2.1 and DM2.3 of Development Management Policies (2013) and is unacceptable in design terms."
