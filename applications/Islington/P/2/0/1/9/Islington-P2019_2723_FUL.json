    "REASON: The proposed roof extension and its overall design, scale, massing, detailed design (windows) and siting within a predominantly unaltered roofline would form a dominant and discordant feature when seen from the private realm. The proposal would have a detrimental visual impact while disrupting the architectural composition of the host property and wider terrace. The proposals are therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8, NPPF 2018, CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013. It also contravenes the guidance within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017."
