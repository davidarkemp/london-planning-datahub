    "REASON: The proposed alterations to the dormer windows, by reason of the inappropriate size, detailed design and appearance, would introduce a dominant and discordant, incongruous feature to the host building that would be visible in public sightlines. The proposed development would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and wider streetscene, and to the character and appearance of the Barnsbury Conservation Area. It would therefore be contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
