    "The proposed rear return dormer by reason of its inappropriate design, scale massing, and depth, would form a dominant and discordant feature which would extend up to the line of the roof eaves, which would result in unwelcomed disruption of the rhythm and would fail to harmonise with the surrounding context of the host building and wider settings. As such the proposal would conflict with adopted policy DM2.1 of Islington Development Management Policies 2013 and advise contained within Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
