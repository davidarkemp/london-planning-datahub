    "REASON: The proposed works, by reason of the roof extension and through lack of information about the rear elevation works, would have a detrimental impact on the historic plan form and circulation, cause harm to the fabric, be an unsympathetic design and so would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policies D1 (London's form, character and capacity for growth), D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013."
