    "REASON: The proposed solar panels due to their inappropriate scale, height and prominent siting, would form dominant and discordant roof additions to the host property being readily visible from the surrounding public realm. The proposal would cause unacceptable visual harm to the character and appearance of the host property, wider terrace setting and the wider Calabria Road Conservation Area by virtue of undermining the aesthetic quality of the building through the addition of visual clutter.  The proposed works are, therefore, contrary to; Section 16 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework July 2018, Policy 7.8 (Sustaining and Enhancing the Significance of Heritage Assets) of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington's Built and Historic Environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, and; Policies DM2.1 (Design) and Policy DM2.3 (Heritage) of the Islington Development Management Policies June 2013, Islington's Urban Design Guide paragraph 5.174 and the NPPF 2019."
