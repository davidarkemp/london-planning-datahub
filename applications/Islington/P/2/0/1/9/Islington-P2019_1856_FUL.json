    "The development's failure to propose sufficient floorspace (B1c, B2 and B8) appropriate to the role of the industrial area within a development of largely open B1 floorspace results in a proposal that is not considered to sufficiently complement or support the economic and employment role of the LSIS, as identified in Policy DM5.3, and compromises the scope for future intensification of industrial uses (B1c,B2,B8). The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to the objectives of Policy DM 5.3. \r\n\r\nFurther, the application fails to provide sufficient industrial floorspace to ensure no net loss of industrial floorspace capacity. It therefore, fails to comply with the draft London Plan policy, namely E4,  and it does not attempt to intensify  industrial uses in a proactive manner as  set out Policy E7 of the new London Plan.   \r\n \r\nThe proposal is also contrary to policy SP3 and B2 of the emerging Local Plan, which give  effect to Policies E4 and E7 of the new London Plan, as well as the  evidence which underpin both plans."
