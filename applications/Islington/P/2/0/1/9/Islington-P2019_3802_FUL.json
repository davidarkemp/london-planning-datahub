    "REASON: The proposed roof extension, by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, bulk, height and massing including its relationship with the floors below and its side parapet walls would fail to preserve the historic character and visual appearance of the locally listed building and the setting of the Grade II* Listed Building and the wider Roseberry Avenue Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore unacceptable in design terms, and contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide 2017, Roseberry Avenue Conservation Area Design Guidelines and NPPF 2019."
