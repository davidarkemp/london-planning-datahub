    "REASONS FOR REFUSAL: The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its unsympathetic design, including bulk, scale, massing, form and junction with the existing building, in addition to its detrimental impact on the historic plan form as well the loss of garden space, would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building. The works would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the heritage asset contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
