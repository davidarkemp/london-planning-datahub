    "REASON: The application has failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances that the loss of the existing business floorspace would be acceptable through the submission of clear and robust marketing evidence which demonstrates that host premises has been vacant and continuously marketed for a period of 2 years. The marketing evidence submitted fails to comply with Appendix 11 of Development Management Policies (2013) and fails to demonstrate that there is no demand for the existing business floorspace and is considered to be unacceptable in land use terms. Therefore the proposal is contrary to policy BC8 part A(i) of the Finsbury Local Plan (2013) and policy DM5.2 of Development Management Policies (2013)."
