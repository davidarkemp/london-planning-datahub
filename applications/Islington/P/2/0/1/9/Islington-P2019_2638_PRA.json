    "Due to their siting and appearance, the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as dominant and discordant additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location, cluttering the roof, and would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the wider St Luke's Conservation Area and associated Heritage assets.  The proposal is therefore contrary policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policy DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013), contrary to the Finsbury Local Plan (2013) Policy BC7 and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide (2017)."
