    "Reason : 1 - REASON: The proposed new 3 storey building, due to its scale, bulk, massing and detailed design would result in a discordant and incongrous feature that would have an adverse visual impact on the character and appearance of the host building, adjacent terrace on Bardolph Road and wider area, contrary to  Policy CS8 of the Islington Core Stategy (2011), Policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013) and the advice found within the Urban Design Guide (2017).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - REASON: The proposed unit is considered to provide sub-standard accommodation as they would not provide an adequate amount and quality of natural light or outlook, would be overlooked by existing residential units at 1 Cardwell Terrace, and would have an undersized top floor bedroom contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2015, The Housing SPD March 2016; policy CS12  of Islington Council's Core Strategy 2011; policies DM2.1 and DM3.4 of  Development Management Policies 2013.\r\n",
