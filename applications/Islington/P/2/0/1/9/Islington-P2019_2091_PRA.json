    "REASON:  Due to their siting and appearance, the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as dominant and discordant additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location, and would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the wider Barnsbury Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policy DM2.1of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide 2017."
