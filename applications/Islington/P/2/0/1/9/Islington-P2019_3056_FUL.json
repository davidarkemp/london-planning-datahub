    "REASON: The proposed mansard (including the raising of the parapet to enclose a roof terrace) by reason of its inappropriate design, the loss of a predominantly unaltered roofline, height and massing would be unacceptable, as it would fail to preserve the visual appearance and historic character of the host building and the character and appearance of the wider area. It would therefore fail to comply with CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011 policies and policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the Urban Design Guide 2017"
