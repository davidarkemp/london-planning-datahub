    "REASON: The proposed single storey roof extension is contrary to the Conservation Area Design Guidelines for Bunhill Fields and Finsbury Square due to its overall inappropriate design, scale, height bulk, massing, use of materials and prominent siting at 9th floor level that will be highly visible from Finsbury Square as well as long views along City Road. The proposal would form a dominant and discordant feature when seen within its surrounding urban context. The proposed glazed roof pavilion will cause less than substantial harm to the conservation area and adjoining locally listed building with insufficient public benefit to justify the harm that is being caused. The development is therefore contrary to London Plan (2016) Policy 7.8, Islington Core Strategy (2011) Policies CS8 and CS9, Development Management Policies (2013) DM2.1 and DM2.3 as well as the NPPF (2019) Chapter 16."
