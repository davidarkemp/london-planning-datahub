    "REASON: The proposed development, by reason of the inappropriate bulk, depth, width and massing of the ground and first floor level front extension, blank boundary treatment and street frontage and the poor resulting fenestration pattern of the southern elevation, would result in discordant and incongruous additions that would dominate the front of the building readily visible from the surrounding public realm. The resulting front elevation of the building would lack coherence and demonstrates a lack of design unity, causing harm to the host building, streetscene, and the wider Newington Green Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
