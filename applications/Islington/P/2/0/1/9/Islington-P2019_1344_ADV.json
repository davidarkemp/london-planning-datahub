    "REASON: The proposed advertisement structure by reason of its height, design, siting and prominent location within the setting of the Grade II* listed St John's Church, would increase visual clutter and would harm the visual amenity of the area as well as the neighbouring ST John's Grove Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 6.10, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1, DM2.3, DM2.6 and DM2.7 of the Development Management Policies 2013, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017, the NPPG (advert regulations), the NPPF (2019) and the emerging draft London Plan Policies T2 and D7."
