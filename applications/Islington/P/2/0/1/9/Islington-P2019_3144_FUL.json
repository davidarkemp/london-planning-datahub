    "REASON: The proposed installation of 1.8m high privacy screening & railings at the second floor rear by reason of its  unsympathetic bulk and design would appear form a discordant feature at the rear elevation of a locally listed building creating visual clutter that is out of character with the historic character of the host building and wider terrace setting. The development would be readily visible from the surrounding private realm and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host property and wider conservation area.  The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy (2011) and policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies (2013). It also contravenes the guidance within the Urban Design Guide (2017), Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002) and the NPPF (2019)."
