Remove basal / epicormics (sucker growth) up to a point 1m above crown break and remove deadwood. Crown thin by a maximum of 20% within the main crown.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that the trees will be pruned cyclically every three years within a 12 year period which will be included as part of a planning consent decision notice, after that a new planning application will need to made. This will however be dependent on the trees' regeneration to the pruning regime.\r\n\r\nN.B. Pruning will not extend below the most recent pruning points. Pruning will include the pruning back of tree crowns overhanging the rear gardens of properties backing on to Trays Close located within Gresley Road.",
