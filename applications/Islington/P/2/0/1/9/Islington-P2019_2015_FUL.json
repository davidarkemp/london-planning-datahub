    "REASON:  Due to their siting; prominence and appearance, the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as dominant and discordant additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location, and would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building, Clerkenwell Green Conservation Area as well as the setting of adjacent Grade I, Grade II and Grade II* Listed Buildings. Furthermore, there is also insufficient information to demonstrate that the proposal would impact on protected views. Therefore, the perceived public benefit of the equipment does not outweigh the harm caused to the heritage assets. For this reason, the proposal is contrary to The National Planning Policy Framework 2019 (NPPF) together with policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016,  CS8 and CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1,  DM2.3, DM2.4 and DM2,7 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the guidance contained within the Conservation Area Design Guidelines, the Urban Design Guide 2017 and Finsbury Local Plan."
