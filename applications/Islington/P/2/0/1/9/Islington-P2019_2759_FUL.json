    "REASON: The proposed extension, by reason of its height, scale and proximity to other residential buildings would cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of adjacent residential properties through overbearing and harm to outlook.  The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that there will not be any impact on adjacent residential buildings through loss of daylight/sunlight.  The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan Policy 7.6, Policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies (2013), as well as BRE 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice' (Second Edition 2011)."
