    "REASON:  Due to their siting and appearance, the proposed antennas and supporting structures would appear as dominant and discordant additions to the roof of the building within the sensitive location, and would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the wider Duncan Terrace/Colebrooke Row Conservation Area as well as the setting of the adjoining and adjacent Grade II listed building. The proposal is therefore contrary policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the guidance contained within the Conservation Area Design Guidelines and the Urban Design Guide 2017."
