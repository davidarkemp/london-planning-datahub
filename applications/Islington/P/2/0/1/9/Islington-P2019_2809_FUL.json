    "Reason : 1 - REASON: The proposed ground floor rear extension with outdoor terrace above, by reason of its inappropriate design, scale, siting, depth, height, massing and bulk would form a dominant and discordant feature, to the detriment of the appearance of the host building and the character of the terrace.  It would be visually harmful from private views from inside the conservation area and would neither preserve nor conserve its character, contrary to Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan; Policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington's Development Policies (2013); Policies CS8 and CS9 of the Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and the advice given by the Islington's Urban Design Guide and the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines.",
    "Reason : 2 - REASON: The proposed terrace above the ground floor rear extension, by reason of its proximity to the rear habitable room windows and gardens of the adjoining neighbours would result in a material loss of privacy, overlooking and outlook, as well as an increased sense of enclosure, to neighbouring residential occupiers. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policy DM2.1 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and the guidance set out in the Urban Design Guide 2017."
