    "REASON: The proposed development would result in a poor standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers of Flats 1 and 2 as outlook from the french doors of the main living spaces of each of the proposed properties would be of the boundary walls enclosing and subdividing the existing garden to create 2 external amenity spaces at short distances, creating an unacceptable sense of enclosure. Each of the main living spaces have deep floorplans and this poor level of outlook would result in a lack of daylight and sunlight to these primary habitable rooms. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies DM3.4 and DM3.5 of Development Management Policies (2013)."
