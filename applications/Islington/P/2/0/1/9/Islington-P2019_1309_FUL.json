    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of its siting, location and design being located on the side and rear elevations would interupt the existing predominantly unaltered roofline and be overdevelopment and incongruous element within the terrace disrupting its rythmn and unity and would therefore be a harmful form of development that would harm the character and appearance of the area and semi-detached propoerty. the proposal is contrary to Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017) and Policies CS9, DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Plan (2012)."
