    "The proposed mansard roof extensions by reason of their size, design and positioning would appear visually incongruous, failing to relate satisfactorily to the locally listed building. They would be a discordant feature and be detrimental to the appearance and architectural composition of the host buildings and the wider Barnsbury Conservation Area.The proposal is, therefore, considered contrary to the objectives of Chapter 16 of the NPPF (2019) which seek to conserve and enhance the historic environment, policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 which seek to preserve and enhance the significance of heritage assets as well as the provisions of policy CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 which seek to protect and enhance Islington's built and historic environment and policy DM2.3 of Islington's Development Management Policies which seeks to protect and enhance Islington's historic environment, and the guidance in the Urban Design Guide (2017) and Paragraph 10.22 of Barnsbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
