    "REASON: The proposed gas pipe, by reason of its alignment and location upon the front elevation of the host building, would be an incongruous addition to the building that would be visible in both long and short public sightlines from Hamilton Park. It would therefore represent a harmful addition to the building, and would cause harm to the character and appearance of the Highbury Fields Conservation Area, contrary to the NPPF 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, emerging policies of the London Plan draft December 2019, policy CS9 of the Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013, and the guidance contained within the Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
