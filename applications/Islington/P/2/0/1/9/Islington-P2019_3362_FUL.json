The addition would be readily visible from the public realm and would cause clear visual harm, detracting from the character and appearance of the Upper Street (North) Conservation Area, and as such, would be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 of the Islington Core Strategy 2011, policy DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Islington Development Management Policies 2013, the Islington Urban Design Guide 2017 and the Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002."
