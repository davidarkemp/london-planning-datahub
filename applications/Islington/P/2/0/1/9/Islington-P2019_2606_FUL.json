    "REASON: The proposal would result in the unjustified loss of business floor space within a designated Employment Priority Area and the Central Activities Zone, and the marketing evidence submitted is insufficient to demonstrate that the property has been adequately marketed for a period of at least two-years, nor is the submitted market demand analysis sufficiently robust to justify the insufficient marketing evidence provided. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to the NPPF 2019, Policy CS13 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM5.2 of the Development Management Policies 2013, and Policy BC8 of the Finsbury Local Plan 2013."
