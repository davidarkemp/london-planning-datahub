    ".\r\nREASON: The proposed roof extension would result in the partial loss of the historic valley roof which forms a significant part of the character of the buildings in the Arlington Square Conservation Area, and would be visible from surrounding views within the Conservation Area and would therefore be unacceptable in principle, as it would visually disrupt the existing roofscape. Therefore the proposal would represent an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would be harmful to the Locally Listed building, the integrity of the terrace and the character and appearance of the Arlington Square Conservation area. The proposal is contrary to policy 12 (Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy 2011, policies DM2.1 and DM2.3 of the Development Management Policies 2013 and guidance contained within the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2017) and the Arlington Square Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
