This is because the ground floor extension is more than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and extends beyond the side elevation of the original dwellinghouse; the first floor extension is more than 4m in height; and details have not been submitted with regard to materials or obscure glazing of side windows. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development is not permitted development and planning permission would be required from the Local Planning Authority."
