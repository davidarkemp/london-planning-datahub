    "REASON: The proposed roof extension by reason of the loss of the original butterfly roof form would adversely affect the character and special architectural and historic interest of the listed building and the loss of the rear butterfly roof form would cause harm to the character and appearance of the St. Mary Magdalene Conservation Area. The proposal would, therefore cause harm to the significance of the designated heritage assets contrary to paragraph 196 of Chapter 16 (conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2018, policy 7.8 (Heritage Assets and Archaeology) of the London Plan 2016, policy CS9 (protecting and enhancing Islington's built and historic environment) of Islington's Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM2.1 (design) and DM2.3 (heritage) of Islington's Development Management Policies 2013, guidance contained within Islington's Conservation Area Design Guidelines 2002 and Islington's Urban Design Guide 2017."
