These were incorporated into the scheme by the applicant.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in a scheme that accords with policy and guidance as a result of positive, proactive and collaborative working between the applicant, and the LPA during the application stages, with the decision issued in a manner in accordance with the NPPF."
