    "REASON: The proposed single storey porch by reason of its inappropriate and unsympathetic design and poor choice of finishing materials would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building. The proposed porch would represent an unsightly interruption from the existing continuous uniform and rhythmic elevation of the building. The proposal therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4 (Local character) and 7.6 (Architecture) of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 (Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Character) of the Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan 2002 and policies DM1 (Design) of the emerging Development Management Policies 2012."
