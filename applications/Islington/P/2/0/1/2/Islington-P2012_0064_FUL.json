    "REASON: The proposed roof extension would be situated within a terrace that has a largely uniform and predominantly unaltered roofline and by reason of its size, form and location, the extension would be an overdominant and incongruous element that would be harmful to the appearance of the host building, the rhythm and integrity of the terrace and the character and appearance of the area contrary to policies D4 (Designing in Context) and D11 (Alterations and Extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan (2002), policies CS8 and CS9 of Islington's Core Strategy (2011) and emerging policy DM1 of the Development Management Policies (Submission Version 2012) and guidance contained within the Islington's Urban Design Guide (2006)."
