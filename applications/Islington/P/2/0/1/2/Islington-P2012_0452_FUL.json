    "REASON: The proposed single storey side/rear extension and rear gable enlargement by reason of their excessive scale, bulk, massing, design and appearance is considered to be an overdominant form of development which would bear no relationship to the existing scale and context of the host building and would result in the loss of the majority of an original rear facade.  It would also neither preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011) policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islington’s Built and Historic Environment) of Islington’s Core Strategy 2011, policies D4 (Designing in context), D11 (Alterations and extensions), D25 (Roof Extensions), D27 (Side Extensions) and D28 (Rear Extensions) of Islington's Unitary Development Plan 2002, Islington's Urban Design guidance 2006, the Canonbury Conservation Area Design Guidelines and DM1 (Design) and DM3 (Heritage) of the Emerging Development Management Plan, 2012."
