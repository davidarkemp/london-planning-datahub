    "REASON: The fully glazed design which lacks any detailing would fail to respect the proportions of the host buildings and as such would have an adverse impact on visual appearance and the streetscene.  In addition, the proposed design, amalgamating two shopfronts, would result in an unbalanced frontage to the wider shopping parade which is characterised by narrower shopfronts.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to the guidance contained within the Islington Shopfront Design Guide (2003) and the Islington Urban Design Guide (2006).  The proposal would be further contrary to policy CS12 of the Core Strategy (2012); policies D4 and D11 of the UDP (2002); and draft policies DM1 and DM3 of the Development Management Policies (Submission Document 2012)."
