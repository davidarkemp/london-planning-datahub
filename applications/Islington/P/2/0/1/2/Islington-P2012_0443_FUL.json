    "REASON: The proposed change of use to hot food takeaway would result in the unacceptable loss of an existing retail (Use Class A1) unit. No evidence has been provided to demonstrate that the ground floor premises has been vacant for a continuous period of at least 2 years and marketed for this 2 year vacancy. The proposal is thereby considered to be contrary to Policy CS14 (Retail and services) of the Core Strategy and Policy DM24 (Dispersed Shops) of Islington's Development Management Policies Submission June 2012."
