    "REASON:  The proposed roof extension, by virtue of its size and bulk would be harmful to the character and appearance of the original building and the integrity of the wider terrace and would fail to respect the principles laid out in section 2.4.2 of the statutory Urban Design Guide (2006) by disrupting the largely unaltered roofline of the terrace, to the detriment of the appearance of the surrounding Sotheby Road Conservation area.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy CS9 (Protecting and Enhancing Islingtonâ€™s Built and Historic Environment) of the Core Strategy; policies D3 (Site Planning), D4 (Designing in Context), D11 (Alterations and Extension), D24 (Materials) and D25 (Roof Extensions) of the Islington Unitary Development Plan (2002), draft policies DM1 (Design) and DM3 (Heritage) of the Development Management Policies (Submission Document 2012), and guidance contained within the Islington Urban Design Guidelines (2006) and Conservation Area Design Guidelines (2002)."
