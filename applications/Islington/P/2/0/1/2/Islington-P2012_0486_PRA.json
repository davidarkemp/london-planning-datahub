    "17.\tThe proposed telecommunications equipment cabinet, by reason of its height, scale, colour and siting against the flank elevation of a grade II listed building, would be excessively prominent and visually detrimental to the character and appearance of the conservation area and the setting of the listed building. The proposed cabinet would therefore be contrary to policies Env 9, Env 10, D3, D4, D5, D22 and T47 of the Unitary Development Plan, policies CS8 and CS9 of the Core Strategy and policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011) and to the guidance in Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
