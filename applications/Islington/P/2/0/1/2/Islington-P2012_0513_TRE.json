    "Refusal of permission\r\nThe application to fell the tree has been refused for three reasons:\r\n(i)\ton the basis of loss of a visual amenity and \r\n(ii)\ton the basis that the agent has failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the Council that the tree requires removal. \r\n(iii)\tThe agent has failed to provide a structural engineers report and level monitoring to discount other probable causes of the damage, damaged or leaking drains and the change of soil beneath the property from London Clay to River bed gravel. \r\n\r\nLoss of visual amenity\r\n\r\nThe tree contributes materially to the amenities of the locality, playing an important part in providing a sense of scale, maturity and textural diversity to the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe tree is situated within the Canonbury Conservation area and the council deemed this tree worthy of the implication of a TPO in 2007. The level of amenity provided since the imposition of the TPO has not declined.\r\n    \r\n\r\nLevel of evidence\r\n\r\nWe do not currently have the level of evidence we require to allow this tree to be removed, the level of evidence and detail required being commensurate with the amenity value of the tree. In this particular case taking a balanced view the Council considers that the evidence so far presented does not meet the tests Islington Council consider appropriate in considering the removal of this preserved tree. \r\n\r\nSpecifically we have not been supplied with a structural engineers report or any level monitoring.\r\n\r\nA structural engineers report detailing the type of property and extent and location of all the property damage, this must contain a BRE Digest 251 assessment of the damage. In addition the report should mention any recent building modifications including history if applicable.\r\n\r\nThere is reference to a report by Michael Mercer of Chester & Partners discussing the damage. This report has not been submitted in support of the application.\r\n\r\nWe will require Detail of the nature and estimated cost of options to repair the damage if the tree is removed and if the tree remains. Without an estimation of this the council cannot make an informed decision as to the relative value of the tree against the cost of repair options.\r\n\r\nWe do require the measurement of the extent and distribution of vertical movement using level monitoring.  For us to consider the removal of a TPO tree the data provided must be sufficient to show a pattern of movement consistent with the presence of the implicated tree.\r\n\r\nDrainage issues have been identified and are awaiting repairs. It is possible where we have such a high level of coarse fines that structural damage may be caused by the washing of fines from the soil by leaking drains. Prolonged exposure to leaking foul water drains or grey water irrigation into clay soil can therefore cause damage to overlying structures. The induced chemical consolidation can be equivalent to significant desiccation over time.\r\n\r\nWe would expect the monitoring after the drainage repairs to identify if this is a contributory factor. \r\n\r\nThe trial pits indicate different soil profiles; this could also be a contributory factor in any differential movement of the property.\r\n\r\nWe do not currently have the level of evidence we require to allow us to make an informed decision as to whether this important amenity tree should be removed. Without the structural engineers report and the level monitoring the council cannot reasonably permit the removal of this protected tree. Further investigation is appropriate and the council remains open to further application with this evidence."
