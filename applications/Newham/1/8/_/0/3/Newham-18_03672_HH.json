  "description": "New additional single-storey extension to be added to the rear of the property, extending out to 4.5m (between 3 - 6m). The extension will also be going approximately 4.5m in width (fence to fence). 50%+ of the garden will still remain. The remaining courtyard behind said extension will be filled, by an extension of the single-storey flank wall - effectively resulting in the rear reception of the property consuming the side alley. This is a width extension of approximately 1m - an area covering approximately 6SqM. A ground floor WC to be included within this space.",
