  "description": "Non-material amendment to planning permission 16/00527/FUL dated 17th June 2019 - Core Positions for plots 3.2 and 4.2 to be moved the cores away from the facade, This allows for a more efficient floor plan, improved apartment layouts, maximised views from apartments. Window Orientation refers to plot 3.2, 3.3, 4.1 and 4.2, Further review of the apartment layouts has identified that handing windows allows more flexibility with internal partition positions and therefore more efficient apartment layouts. Gable End Windows refers to Plot 3.3 and 4.1, With the revised apartment layouts and core positions, the same principle has been carried forward which has resulted in the repositioning of some windows. Window Design refers to Plot 4.3, The South and North elevations will retain the same design externally but back painted glass behind will allow the party wall to meet the external wall without interrupting the facade grid which is key to the overall design. Ground Floor The following refers to Plot 3 + 4, Revised core positions and continued coordination has resulted in changes to the ground floor plan. Basement, The basement layout has been developed following further structural coordination. The amendments allows for a single level basement without ramps, a rearrangement of the parking spaces to better fit around structural columns.",
