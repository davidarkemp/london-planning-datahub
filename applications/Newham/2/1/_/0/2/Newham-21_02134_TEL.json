  "description": "Notification under The Electronic Communications Code (conditions and restrictions) Regulations 2003 (as amended) to utilise Permitted Development Rights, The proposed development consists of the removal of 6no. antennas to be replaced with 6no. new antennas and ancillary works thereto. This option has been chosen as it utilises an existing installation which will improve coverage with minimal changes to the equipment, reducing the visual impact on the surrounding area as far as technically possible. The upgrade will improve 4G and 5G in the area.",
