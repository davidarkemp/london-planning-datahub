  "description": "The proposed installation comprises of the removal and replacement of 3 no. antennas on existing support poles; removal, replacement and installation of associated ancillary equipment and development ancillary thereto.\r\rThe site is an existing telecoms site which provides essential coverage to this area. It is located on the roof of one of the retail buildings at London City Airport and upgrading the installation will have minimal impact on the overall appearance of the installation and its design. The newly upgraded equipment would be viewed in the context of the existing and, given the minimal changes to the appearance of the equipment, would result in no visual impact above and beyond that which has already been accepted. The upgraded equipment would bring much needed improvements to coverage for customers in the area and the public benefits weigh in favour of the upgrade.\r\rThe search area has been dictated by technical assessment of which areas are experiencing a deficit in the level of network coverage required to meet the increasing demand. The proposed site is the optimum choice for an installation that can provide the required network coverage to the area without having a detrimental visual effect. The existing development forms a minor ancillary feature to the building, and would continue to do so, therefore being the ideal installation for an upgrade and the most suitable in order to upgrade existing network coverage to this area.",
