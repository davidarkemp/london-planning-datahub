  "description": "Application for a lawful development certificate proposed for the Following the Direction under Article 4(1) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 in relation to the Durham Road Conservation Area, London Borough of Newham, Class C of part 1 of that schedule.\r\rFollowing water ingress as a result to defective roofing material, I am proposing to replace the whole roof slate cover (front, side and rear slopes) and battens in a ?like for like? manner using fiber slate tiles or synthetic equivalent (with identical appearance), in keeping with the conservation status of the area. New fascia boards, guttering, and all related fittings will also be replaced to improve drainage.\r\rThe unstable rear chimney stack located on the rear elevation of the existing wall serves no purpose, and needs to be removed completely to prevent collapse to the storey below. All other properties on the road have had their rear stacks removed, so this would be in keeping with the area.\r\rWork will require erection of scaffolding to front, side, and rear elevation before removal of existing slates and battens back to existing rafters. We propose installation of a new breathable membrane and batten fastenings to the existing rafters, before fitting new fibre or synthetic slates fastened with copper rivets and copper nails. We propose new leadwork around the main chimney stack along with new universal concrete ridges with a dry ridge system. We propose installation of new black half round guttering to front, side and rear elevation with new downpipes and fascia boards. Finally, we propose removal of rear chimney stack as no longer in use and at risk of collapse.\r\rThere will no changes made to the existing access to the site.",
