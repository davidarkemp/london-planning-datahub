  "description": "Application for a lawful development certificate for proposed proposal is to reconfigure the bin store tower at the front of the Block at Beaconsfield Road following complaints by residents that the current configuration mans that the bin smell comes into the block. The bin store access is currently facing the communal entrance doors and the proposal is to block up this access and form a new access on the road side of the tower. This will involve repositioning the metal railings as well as forming a new gate and a small area of hardstanding so that the bins can be moved to the road by the refuse collectors.",
