  "description": "Application for a lawful development certificate for proposed  include for the removal of the existing uPVC shiplap cladding from the face of the properties at 32-158 Snowhill Road and replacement in a Hardie board plank which is a fibre cement non flammable version. This is being carried out as part of general refurbishment to the block. The reason that the material is being changed is that the uPVC cladding is flammable and it would be beneficial as part of the works to the block to mitigate fire risk where we  can by replacing this element of the block in a Euro Class A panel .The panel is similar aesthetically to the existing uPVC.",
