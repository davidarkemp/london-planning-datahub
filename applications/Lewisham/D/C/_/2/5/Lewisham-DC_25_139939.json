  "description": "An application submitted under Section 96a of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990 for a non-material amendment in connection with the planning permission DC/24/137124 dated 13 March 2025 in order to allow; the variation of the external appearance of the consent scheme:- Consented external black pressed aluminium fenestration detailing has been replaced by reclaimed London stock brickwork; A brick curve has been introduced to the left hand corner of the street facing North elevation at first floor and parapet level to help soften the overall building mass when viewed from Breakspears Road; The street facing boundary treatment has been amended. 2no. skylights have been omitted from ground level and replaced with a reclaimed London stock planter. The new planter will help create defensible space between the property and the pavement, whilst retaining passive security and overlooking from the kitchen out onto the street; The external courtyard to the rear has been lowered to basement level to allow for direct access of fresh air and natural light into the new proposed study and bathroom; The high-level first floor bathroom window on the rear facade has been omitted; Construction of the angled window on the rear facade has been reduced down in scale from a large, angular brick form to a smaller, timber joinery element. The new proposal will include a large fixed side panel of obscured glass, helping to mitigate any possibility of compromising the privacy of neighbouring properties or their amenity spaces. The smaller angled profile will include the casement window at 60 Breakspears Road SE4.",
