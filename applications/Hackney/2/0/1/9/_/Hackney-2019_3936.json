Any energy system to be adopted shall be future proofed to have the\npotential to connect to nearby district heating networks.\n4. clarification as to how the ASHP for DWH will operate alongside heating and\ncooling or any other technologies being specified for the development;\n5. details of the Seasonal Coefficient of Performance (SCoP) and Seasonal\nEnergy Efficiency ratio (SEER);\n6. full details of location of the condenser units from the VRF systems (or any\nother fixed plant adopted) and noise solutions to mitigate impact for nearby\nsensitive receptors;\n7. information about refrigerants that are required to have a Low or Zero\nGlobal Warming Potential (GWP) and Zero Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP)\n8. commitment to monitor the performance of the energy system post-construction, to ensure the expected performance approved is achieved.\nREASON: In the interests of the promotion of sustainable forms of\ndevelopment\nand construction.&nbsp;",
    "Contaminated Land: Risk Assessment\nNo development shall commence (excluding demolition) until an assessment\nof the risks posed by any contamination shall have been submitted to and\napproved in writing by the local planning authority. This assessment must be\nundertaken by a suitably qualified contaminated land practitioner, in\naccordance with British Standard BS 10175: Investigation of potentially\ncontaminated sites - Code of Practice and the Environment Agency’s Model\nProcedures for the Management of Land Contamination (CLR 11) (or\nequivalent British Standard and Model Procedures if replaced), and shall\nassess any contamination on the site, whether or not it originates on the site.\nThe assessment shall include: a survey of the extent, scale and nature of\ncontamination; the potential risks to: human health; property (existing or\nproposed) including buildings, crops, livestock, pets, woodland and service\nlines and pipes; adjoining land; ground waters and surface waters; ecological\nsystems; and archaeological sites and ancient monuments.\nREASON: To protect human health, water resources, property and the wider \nenvironment from harm and pollution resulting from land contamination.&nbsp;",
    "Reporting unexpected contamination\nIn the event that contamination is found at any time when carrying out the\napproved development that was not previously identified it must be reported in\nwriting within 7 days to the Local Planning Authority and once the Local\nPlanning Authority has identified the part of the site affected by the\nunexpected contamination development must be halted on that part of the site.\nAn assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of\nthe site investigation, and where remediation is necessary a remediation\nscheme, together with a timetable for its implementation, must be submitted to\nand approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in accordance with\nthe requirements of the approved remediation scheme.\nThe measures in the approved remediation scheme must then be implemented\nin accordance with the approved timetable. Following completion of measures\nidentified in the approved remediation scheme a validation report must be\nsubmitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in\naccordance with the implementation of the remediation scheme. \nREASON: To protect the end user(s) of the development, any adjacent land\nuser(s) and the environment from contamination.&nbsp;",
    "Demolition and Construction Management Plan\nNotwithstanding the documents hereby approved, no development shall take\nplace until a detailed Demolition and Construction Management Plan covering \nthe matters set out below only has been submitted to and approved in writing\nby the Local Planning Authority. The development shall only be carried out in\naccordance with the details and measures approved as part of the demolition\nand construction management plan, which shall be maintained throughout the\nentire construction period. The plan must include:\n- A demolition and construction method statement covering all phases of the\ndevelopment to include details of noise control measures and measures to\npreserve air quality (including a risk assessment of the demolition and\nconstruction phase);\n- A Dust Management Plan to control dust emissions during demolition and\nconstruction;\n- Details of compliance with ‘chapter 7 of the Cleaner Construction Machinery\nfor London: A Low Emission Zone for Non-Road Mobile Machinery’ in relation\nto Only Non Road Mobile Machinery or used at the development site during the\ndemolition and construction process along with details that all NRMM are\nentered on the Non Road Mobile Machinery online register at\nhttps://nrmm.london/user-nrmm/register before being operated. Where NonRoad Mobile Machinery, which does not comply with ‘chapter 7 of the Cleaner\nConstruction Machinery for London: A Low Emission Zone for Non-Road\nMobile Machinery’, is present on site all development work will stop until it has\nbeen removed from site.\n- A demolition and construction waste management plan setting out how\nresources will be managed and waste controlled at all stages during a\nconstruction project, including, but not limited to, details of dust mitigation\nmeasures during site clearance and construction works (including any works\nof demolition of existing buildings or breaking out or crushing of concrete),\nthe location of any mobile plant machinery, - Details of measures to be\nemployed to mitigate against noise and vibration arising out of the\nconstruction process demonstrating best practical means.\n- Details of the location where deliveries will be undertaken; the size and\nnumber of lorries expected to access the site daily; the access arrangements\n(including turning provision if applicable); construction traffic routing; details\nof parking suspensions (if required) for the duration of construction.\nREASON: To avoid hazard and obstruction being caused to users of the public\nhighway, in the interest of public safety and amenity, in order to prevent the\nconstruction of the development having an unacceptable environmental\nimpact upon neighbouring properties and to protect air quality, human health\nand to contribute to National Air Quality Objectives.&nbsp;"
