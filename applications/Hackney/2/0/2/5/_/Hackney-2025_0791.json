  "description": "Medium sized Horse Chestnut in back garden to fell to ground level. Very close to property (within 2.5m) with a heavy lean towards the building. Large primary cavity near base, 70 (H) x 10 (W) inches visible. Extends a further 18 inches upwards inside of tree. Secondary cavity at back at same level, measured at 10 inches deep. High likelihood of further decay inside. Roots are lifted above soil level on both sides.Tree not visible from road over houses, just from side of building. Considering the high value of the house, poor initial location and strong evidence of decay at and near ground level, an urgent fell to ground level is warranted.In order to adhere to the Hackney Local Plan 2033 policy LP51 B a replacement tree will be planted in the front or rear garden.&nbsp; The new tree will be at least select standard size (10-12 cm girth), a native species or one known to provide benefits to local wildlife, and a species which is not considered invasive in Hackney.&nbsp; The replacement tree will be planted during the planting season current at the time of felling (end October - end March) or during the next immediately available planting season.&nbsp;",
