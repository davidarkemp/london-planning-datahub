A site visit took place on 25 September 2024 with conservation officer Adam Dyer. Although informal feedback was provided by Adam Dyer (via Clive Theobald on 18 November 2024), no formal written advice was received.\n\nA Prior Approval application was submitted on 17 December 2024 (Ref: 2024/2779) for change of use of the first to third floors from ancillary office space (Class E) to a two-bedroom flat (Class C3) with a Class E commercial space retained on the ground floor, under Class G of the GPDO. This application has not yet been validated due to the need for accompanying Listed Building Consent for internal alterations. This application provides this, aligning with the Prior Approval application, being specifically for internal works only to support the change of use.\n\nA combined Planning and Listed Building Consent application was submitted separately on 11 March 2025 (Ref: 2025/0556) for internal alterations and a first-floor rear extension. This application was validated on 17 March 2025 and is due to be determined by 9 May 2025. That application does not align with the Prior Approval application due to the first-floor extension, but is made with the intent to provide a better quality first floor flat.\n\nAdditionally, Listed Building Consent (Ref: 2023/1119) was granted in 2023 for: internal partitions on the ground floor, a new internal stair core on all floors, new internal partitions on upper floors and internal insulation.\n\nA Prior Approval (Ref: 2023/1081) application was also granted for change of use of the first to third floors from ancillary office space (Class E) to a two-bedroom flat (Class C3) with a Class E commercial space retained on the ground floor, under Class G of the GPDO. \n\nThis application and the current Prior Approval application (Ref: 2024/2779) differ from the 2023 consent in seeking permission for two flats instead of three.\n",
