    "The proposed front and rear dormer extensions would appear as obtrusive and incongruous additions that would be at odds with the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding terrace row and harmful to the character and appearance of the Graham Road and Mapledene Conservation Area. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained in the Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).",
    "The proposed upper ground floor terrace, by virtue of its scale and siting would have a detrimental impact on the amenity enjoyed by the neighbouring occupiers at No.32 Graham Road in respect of loss of privacy. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D1 (Londonâ€™s form, character and capacity for growth) and D6 (Housing quality and standards) of the London Plan (2021) and policy LP2 (Development and amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020)."
