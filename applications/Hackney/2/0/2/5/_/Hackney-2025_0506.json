The proposed development would be contrary to Policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and HC1 (Heritage conservation) of the London Plan 2021; Policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets), and LP4 (Non-Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033; the De Beauvoir Conservation Area Appraisal; and the guidance contained in the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
