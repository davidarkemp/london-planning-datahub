The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved and shall be fully implemented before the premises are first occupied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure compliance with biodiversity requirements&lt;/p&gt;",

The size of the trees shall be at least a Light Standard as per BS 3936-1:1992 (or any standard that reproduces or replaces this standard). The trees shall be maintained for 5 years after planting and should they be removed, die, be severely damaged or become seriously diseased within this period they shall be replaced with another tree as originally required to be planted by this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason: In the interests of safeguarding the benefits provided by trees, having regard to Policy LP51 in the Local Plan 2033 (adopted 2020).&lt;/p&gt;"
