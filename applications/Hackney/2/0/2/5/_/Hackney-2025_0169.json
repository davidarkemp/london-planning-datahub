    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, and detailed design would result in the loss of the original roof form within a terrace with an unbroken roof line and would result in an overly dominant and obtrusive form of development that fails to respect the character of the host property and the wider terrace it forms a part of.&amp;nbsp; As such, the proposed development is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising Site Capacity through the Design-led Approach) and D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP17 (Housing Design) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 (2020) and the guidance contained within Hackney&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, its detailed design including the L- shaped form fails to meet the advice regarding the correct appearance for a rear dormer roof extension as set out in the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009), resulting in an overly-dominant, obtrusive, and out of keeping extension that fails to result in high-quality design as required by policy LP1 of LP33 (2020),&amp;nbsp; policies D3 (Optimising Site Capacity through the Design-led Approach) and&amp;nbsp;D4 (Delivering good design)&amp;nbsp;the London Plan (2021) and Hackney&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"
