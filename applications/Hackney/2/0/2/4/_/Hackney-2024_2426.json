    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed Communication Hub, by reason of its scale, appearance and location would result in an obstructive and intrusive form of development that would obstruct the pavement, reduce the amount of space available for use by pedestrians, block lines of sight creating blind spots and create distractions for highway users reducing the safety of the highway. As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D8 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27; of the London Plan (2021) as well as policy PP1 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27;, LP41 &#x27;Liveable Neighbourhoods&#x27; and LP42 &#x27;Walking and Cycling&#x27; of the Hackney Local Plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed Communication Hub, by reason of its scale, siting and appearance would result in an obtrusive and visually incongruous feature that contributes to an unsightly proliferation and clutter of signage and street furniture in the local area that would detract from the visual amenity of the street scene. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D4 (Delivering Good Design),&amp;nbsp; D8 (Public Realm) of the London Plan (2021) and policies PP1 (Public Realm) and LP1 (High Quality Design) of Hackney&#x27;s Local Development Plan (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
