If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure the provision of suitable SUDS onsite to aid in reducing surface water.&lt;/p&gt;",
