    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, due to its siting, scale, design and massing, fails to respect the existing townscape and urban grain. By closing gaps and blocking openings in the host buildings&#x27; outriggers, it adversely affects the character of the area. Consequently, the development is contrary to Policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 and Policies D1(London’s form, character and capacity for growth), D3(Optimising site capacity through the design-led) and D4(Delivering good design) of the London Plan (2021).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution towards affordable housing fails to deliver the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing and is therefore contrary to policy H4 (Delivering affordable housing) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP13 (Affordable housing) of Hackney’s Local Plan 2033 (2020) and Hackney&#x27;s S106 Planning Contributions SPD (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to promote the use of non-sustainable modes of transport and contribute to air pollution and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T6 (Car Parking) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP45 (Parking and Car Free Development) of Hackney’s Local Plan 2033 (2020) and Hackney&#x27;s S106 Planning Contributions SPD (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, due to its siting, scale, and massing, has an unacceptable impact on the amenity of No. 145a and No.145 Homerton High Street. Specifically, its proximity and height lead to significant overshadowing, loss of outlook, and reduced daylight and sunlight for this neighboring property. As a result, the development does not comply with Policy LP2 (Amenity and Development) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033(2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development due to insufficient information with regards to the absence of a noise impact assessment, to demonstrate &amp;nbsp;the development will achieve acceptable noise levels given its proximity to adjacent commercial units. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the development will adequately mitigate potential noise disturbances to future residents. Consequently, the proposal fails to comply with policies LP2 (Development and&amp;nbsp;Amenity) and LP17 (Housing Design) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 and Policy D13(Agent of Change) of the London Plan (2021).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a monitoring fee for the implementation and monitoring of a Construction Management Plan, would likely result in a detrimental impact on the surrounding highway network, contribute to air pollution and congestion in the surrounding area and have a negative impact on amenity of the area, contrary to policies LP2 (Development and Amenity) and LP43 (Transport and Development)&amp;nbsp; of Hackney’s Local Plan 2033 (2020) and Policy T2(Healthy Streets),&amp;nbsp; T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impact and T7(Deliveries, servicing and construction) of the London Plan (2021) and&amp;nbsp; Hackney&#x27;s S106 Planning Contributions SPD (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
