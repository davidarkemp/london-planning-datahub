    "&lt;p&gt;Insufficient Marketing Evidence and Loss of Commercial Use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed change of use from Class E to Class C3 fails to comply with Policy LP36 of the Hackney Local Plan 2033. The application has not demonstrated that the existing commercial unit has been marketed for a minimum of one year with no realistic prospect of continued commercial use. The proposal would result in the loss of a commercial unit outside a designated centre, contrary to the Council’s aim to safeguard such uses and ensure access to essential local services.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Quality of Accommodation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal fails to provide sufficient evidence, including a daylight/sunlight report, to demonstrate that the proposed residential accommodation would provide acceptable living conditions. Without this information, it cannot be confirmed that the development would meet the requirements of Policy LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan 2033, which seeks to ensure high-quality residential environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Insufficient Sustainability and Biodiversity Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application fails to provide the requisite information to address Policies LP54 and LP55 of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 and Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021. No sustainability or overheating assessment has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposal would minimise its environmental impact. Additionally, the absence of a biodiversity net-gain assessment fails to demonstrate how the development would protect or enhance biodiversity, contrary to the Council’s sustainability objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate Design and Harm to Local Character&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed alterations to the property, including the removal of the existing shopfront, relocation of the entrance door, and introduction of domestic fenestration, fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area. The proposals do not relate well to the prominent corner location of the site or its commercial character, undermining the visual coherence of the street scene. The failure to retain or enhance the existing fenestration pattern and the lack of any commitment to restoring original features, such as the removal of poor-quality paint and restoration of brickwork, results in harm to the character of the area, contrary to Policy LP1 of the Hackney Local Plan 2033.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Absence of Unilateral Undertaking or Viability Assessment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application fails to provide a Unilateral Undertaking to secure financial contributions towards affordable housing or a viability assessment to justify why such contributions cannot be made. This is contrary to Policy LP13 of the Hackney Local Plan 2033, which requires residential development to provide financial contributions to affordable housing provision where the scale of development falls below the on-site provision threshold. The absence of these documents means the proposal fails to comply with the Council’s affordable housing policy objectives.&lt;/p&gt;"
