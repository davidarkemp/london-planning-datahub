    "The proposals, by reason of their size, design and position, would result in loss of light and outlook and overbearing impact which would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at no. 64 Durlston Road. As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D6 (Housing quality and standards) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP2 (Development and amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020).",

As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D1 (Londonâ€™s form, character and capacity for growth), D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009."
