    "&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the first refusal reason, the proposed two-storey upward extension, by reason of its inappropriate scale and massing, would appear as an incongruous and overly prominent feature that would be out of character with the surrounding area.

Therefore the application for Prior Approval is refused.&lt;/p&gt;",

Having regard to Part A.2(1)(a) of Class A, Schedule 2, Part 20 of the&amp;nbsp;Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) the proposed extension is not supported on the basis of adverse impact on on-street parking conditions and highway safety.&lt;/p&gt;"
