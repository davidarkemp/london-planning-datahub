If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume. The development shall thereafter be implemented in accordance with the approved details with the SUDS being installed prior to first use of the development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interest of sustainable urban drainage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
