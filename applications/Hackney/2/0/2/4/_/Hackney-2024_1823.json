    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed extensions, by reason of its size, scale, and detailed design would result in an incompatible and obtrusive form of development that fails to be subordinate to and in keeping with the character and appearance of the original dwelling and would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;the symmetry of its attached pair&amp;nbsp;and the terrace of which it forms part.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and the wider area.&amp;nbsp; As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of Hackney’s Local Plan 2033 (2020) and the relevant sections of Hackney’s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal does not demonstrate how it improves biodiversity at the site to achieve the biodiversity net gain (BNG) requirement and, therefore, fails to comply with policy G6 (Biodiversity and access to nature) of the London Plan (2021), and policy LP47 (Biodiversity and Sites of Importance of Nature Conservation) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 (2020) and the GOV UK Planning Practice Guidance for Biodiversity Net Gain (May 2024).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Due to its size and location, the second floor extension would have an unacceptable impact on the amenities enjoyed by the adjoining occupiers of 111 Bouverie Road. Specifically, its proximity and height lead to overshadowing, loss of outlook, and reduced daylight and sunlight. Furthermore, the proposed terrace may increase overlooking and provide new lines of sight into the rear garden at No.111 Bouverie Road and would likely result in noise and disturbance to properties in Grayling and Bouverie Roads. As a result, the development does not comply with policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and D13 (Agent of Change) of the London Plan (2021) and policy LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
