    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved a minimum of one Swift nesting bricks and/or boxes shall be provided at or close to eaves level of the development hereby approved. The bricks/boxes shall be retained thereafter in perpetuity.&nbsp;REASON: In the interests of biodiversity",
    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification, a drainage layout and a management &amp;amp; maintenance plan (where applicable) of at least one suitable sustainable drainage system (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure the provision of a suitable SUDs system onsite to reduce surface water flooding&lt;/p&gt;"
