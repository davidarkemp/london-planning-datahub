As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D1, D4 &amp;amp; D8 of the London Plan (2021) and policies PP1, LP1 and LP7 of Hackney&#x27;s Local Development Plan (2020).&lt;/p&gt;",

As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D8 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27; of the London Plan (2021) as well as policy PP1 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27;, LP7 &#x27;Advertisements&#x27;, LP41 &#x27;Liveable Neighbourhoods&#x27; and LP42 &#x27;Walking and Cycling&#x27; of the Hackney Local Plan.&lt;/p&gt;"
