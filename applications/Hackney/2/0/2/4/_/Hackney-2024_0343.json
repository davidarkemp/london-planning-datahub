As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1, policies LP1, LP3 of the Local Plan 2033 and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009 and the NPPF (2023).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of lack of provision of affordable housing, would fail to adequately contribute towards the provision of mixed and balanced communities and housing need in the local area. As such, the development would not be consistent with Policies H4 and H5 of the London Plan (2021), Hackney Local Plan Policies LP12, LP13 and NPPF (2023) paragraph 63 and the Hackney S106 Planning Contributions Supplementary Planning Document (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of a lack of sufficient energy efficiency measures and/or financial contribution towards carbon offsetting, would fail to achieve the maximum feasible reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, contrary to Hackney Local Plan (LP33) Policy LP55 and London Plan (2021) Policy SI2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
