This shading is particualrly bad in winter as it is anevergreen tree.&nbsp;Furthermore it is growing into the of the windows of 2 St Johns Church Road (see interior photos).&nbsp;It is of low amenity value as not a classic London street tree, was not a part of the original Victorian street scape conservation area, and hasgrown exponentially since 2008 over powering the street. (see attached google street view photos).&nbsp;No proposal to replace due to the street having had saplings planted within the last 5 years to provide green amenity.",
