    "No development shall commence, other than works of demolition, until a report (including intrusive investigation/trial pit and monitoring where necessary) demonstrating that the basement development will not increase the potential for groundwater flooding to itself or to the surrounding area during and post-construction has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. Where groundwater is identified as a potential risk, details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or resistance measures shall be submitted to the LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the basement is occupied. The basement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2022 Protection of below ground structures against water ingress - code of practice.REASON: To mitigate the impact of the development on flooding on and surrounding the site.",

In particular the existing and proposed roof shall not be used as a roof terrace, balcony or any other amenity area.REASON: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises and the area generally.",
    "Prior to the superstructure works, detailed specification a drainage layout and a management and maintenance plan (where applicable) of at least one suitable sustainable drainage system&nbsp; (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.REASON: To ensure the provision of suitable SUDS onsite."
