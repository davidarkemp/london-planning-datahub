As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising Site Capacity through the Design-led Approach) D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan 2021, policy LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;",

As such the proposed development is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D3 (Optimising Site Capacity through the Design-led Approach) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Local Plan 2033, and the guidance as contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;"
