If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration.

The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved and shall be fully implemented before the premises are first occupied.REASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system.
