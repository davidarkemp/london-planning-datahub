    "&lt;p&gt;Sound insulation shall be installed between the commercial premises on the ground floor and residential premises on the first floor. The applicant shall provide a scheme of sound insulation that shall be submitted for approval to the Council’s Noise Section prior to the commence use of these residential units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason: To obtain required sound insulation and prevent noise nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;No development shall take place until a Basement Construction Method Statement has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement shall include details regarding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Detailed site-specific analysis of hydrological and geotechnical local ground conditions,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Analysis of how the excavation of the basement may impact on the water table and any groundwater flow, and whether perched water is present,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Details of how flood risk, including risk from groundwater and surface water flooding has been addressed in the design, including details of any proposed mitigation measures,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Details of measures proposed to mitigate any risks in relation to land instability, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Demonstration of how cumulative effects have been considered and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. A scheme of measures to monitor ground movements protect neighbouring properties from land instability caused by the basement construction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All work shall be carried out and supervised by a suitably qualified person and the development shall thereafter be carried out in accordance with the details and measures thus approved in the Basement Construction Method Statement and Assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason: Development must not commence before this condition is discharged to avoid hazard in relation to land instability and increased flood risk caused by the basement excavation.&lt;/p&gt;",

Discharge the extracted air not less than 1 m above the roof ridge of any building within 20 m of the building housing the commercial kitchen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. If 1 cannot be complied with for planning reasons, then the extracted air shall be discharged not less than 1 m above the roof eaves or dormer window of the building housing the commercial kitchen. Additional odour control measures may be required&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. If 1 or 2 cannot be complied with for planning reasons, then an exceptionally high level of odour control will be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental Protection strongly recommends against low level discharge and the use of weather cowl hats where residential or odour sensitive premises requiring natural ventilation are in close approximation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is impossible to discharge at a high level, the applicant would have to employ a Recirculation System which does not discharge externally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information the acceptable re-circulation systems are currently provided by the following companies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.
