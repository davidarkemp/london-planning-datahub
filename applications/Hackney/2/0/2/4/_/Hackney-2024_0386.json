    "<p>The development hereby permitted must be begun not later than the expiration of three years beginning with the date of this permission.</p><p><br></p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\nREASON: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).</p><p>\r\n</p>",
    "<p>The Development hereby permitted shall only be carried out and completed strictly in accordance with the submitted plans hereby approved and any subsequent approval of details.\r\n</p><p><br></p><p>\r\nREASON: To ensure that the development hereby permitted is carried out in full accordance with the plans hereby approved.\r\n</p>",

    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification, a drainage layout and a management &amp;amp; maintenance plan (where applicable) of at least one suitable sustainable drainage system (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure the provision of suitable SUDS onsite to aid in reducing surface water.&lt;/p&gt;",

The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved and shall be fully implemented before the premises are first occupied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system.
