    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to the occupation of the development, detailed specification, a drainage layout, and a management &amp;amp; maintenance plan (where applicable) of at least one suitable sustainable drainage system (i.e. water butt with overflow, rain garden, bio-retention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system. The condition is required to be discharged prior to the commencement of development to ensure that sustainable drainage is incorporated into the design of the development.&lt;/p&gt;",

The scheme shall include, inter alia, details of mitigation measures against the risk of surface water flooding, flood resistance and resilience measures to speed up recovery after flooding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme shall subsequently be implemented in accordance with the approved details before the development is completed and shall thereafter be retained and maintained, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the LocalPlanning Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interests of prevention of harm to human health and property as a result of flood.&lt;/p&gt;",
