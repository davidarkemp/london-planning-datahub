    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt;&quot;&gt;The proposed development is considered likely to have a significant detrimental impact on the surrounding Highways network because it would attract a high percentage of private vehicle trips, concentrated to specific time periods and with relatively high dwell times, in a location that is unsuited for such demands. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy LP43 (Transport and Development) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033, Policies T2 (Healthy Streets) and T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts) of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of the loss of an approved Authorised Treatment Facility and of an employment use, with inadequate marketing of the unit for prospective tenants having been carried out, is considered to diminish the function and character of the Priority Industrial Area and the function of the North London Waste Plan area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy 1 (Existing Waste Management Sites) of the North London Waste Plan, policy 28 (Protecting and Promoting Industrial Land and Floorspace in the Borough) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033, Policy SI 9 (Safeguarded waste sites) of the London Plan and the National Planning Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;"
