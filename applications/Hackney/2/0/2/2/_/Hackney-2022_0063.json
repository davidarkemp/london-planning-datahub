    "The proposed roof terrace, by reason of its size, design and position, would result in overlooking and loss of privacy which would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers at nos. 35 and 37 Brownswood Road. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth) and D6 (Housing quality and standards) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP2 (Development and amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.",

As such, the proposals would be contrary to policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth), D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) and the guidance contained with the Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document."
