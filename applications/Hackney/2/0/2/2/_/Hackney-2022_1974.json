    "&lt;p&gt;Due to the excessive scale of the proposed extension, particularly in regard to depth,&amp;nbsp; the extension would have a significant and detrimental impact on the amenity enjoyed by the neighbouring residents of no. 36 Forburg Road. This impact would be experienced most acutely in relation to loss of outlook, loss of daylight/sunlight, and an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal is, therefore, considered unacceptable and fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020), and the stipulations of the Council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;By reason of its excessive scale and incongruous design, wrapping around the eastern corner of the original outrigger, the proposed development would fail to appear as a subservient addition and would result in a disproportionate extension to the host dwellinghouse. As a result, the proposal fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of this part of the Northwold and Cazenove Conservation Area. The proposal, therefore, fails to comply with policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1, LP2, and LP3 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020), and the stipulations of the Council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;/p&gt;"
