    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive depth and inappropriate height along the shared boundaries with nos 13 and 17 Denver Road, would have a harmful impact on the amenity enjoyed by residents of these neighbouring properties in regard to both sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and loss of daylight/sunlight. As such, the proposal fails to comply with the stipulations of the Residential Alterations and Extensions SPD (2009) and policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan (LP33).&amp;nbsp;",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its disproportionate and excessive scale, would result in an incongruous form of development that would detract from the original design of the host property and the terrace of which it forms part of. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the stipulations outlined in the council&#x27;s Residential Alterations and Extensions SPD and policy LP1 of the Hackney local Plan (LP33) and policy D4 of the London Plan.&amp;nbsp;"
