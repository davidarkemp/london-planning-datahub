    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk and overall depth along the shared boundary with no. 91 Kyverston Road, would have a harmful impact on the amenities enjoyed by residents of this property. In particular the proposal would result in a loss of outlook and an unacceptable sense of enclosure and fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan LP33, policy D4 of the London Plan 2021 and the stipulations of the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
