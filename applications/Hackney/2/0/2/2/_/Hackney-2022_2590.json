Tree protection for all retained trees at the site and on adjacent land shall be undertaken in accordance with BS5837:2012 (Trees in relation to construction - Recommendations) and will protect the root protection area calculated as described in Table 2 of that British Standard for the duration of all site works (including demolition) undertaken in connection with the development hereby approved.No service runs shall be provided within the root protection area of any tree to be retained at the site or on adjacent land. Protective fencing shall be 2.4m high and conform to Figure 2 of BS5837:2012 i.e. a scaffold framework comprising a vertical and horizontal framework, well braced to resist impacts, with vertical tubes spaced at a maximum interval of 3m. On to this weldmesh panels should be securely fixed with wire or scaffold clamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In order to protect the existing trees during building operation and site works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interests of prevention of exacerbation of surface water flood risk to adjoining land.&lt;/p&gt;",
