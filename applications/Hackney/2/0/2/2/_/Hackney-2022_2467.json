As such, the proposed development is considered contrary to policies D3 (Optimising Sity Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach), D4 (Delivering Good Design) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth), policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) and LP52 (Water Spaces, Canals and Residential Moorings) of the Local Plan 2033 and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of non-compliance with the nationally described space standards and provision of inadequate outdoor amenity space to the proposed residential accommodation, would result in the provision of an unacceptable standard of residential accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers. As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP17 (Housing Design) of the Local Plan 2033 and the guidance contained within the Mayor of London&#x27;s Housing SPG.&lt;/p&gt;",
