If\nsoakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure\nthat the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in\nsurface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\nREASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system.

Details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or\nresistance measures against surface water (overland flow) and groundwater (if identified) shall be submitted to\nthe LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the basement is occupied. The\nbasement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS\n8102:2009 code of practice for &quot;protection of below ground structures against water from the ground&quot; and\ncurrent best practice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\nREASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system.
