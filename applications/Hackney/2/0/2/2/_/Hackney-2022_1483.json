    "&lt;p&gt;No later than three months from the date of this consent, a report (including intrusive investigation/trial pit and monitoring where necessary) demonstrating that the basement development will not increase the potential for groundwater flooding to itself or to the surrounding area has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. Details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or resistance measures against surface water and groundwater (if identified) shall be submitted to the LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the basement is occupied. The basement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2009 code of practice for &quot;protection of below ground structures against water from the ground&quot; and current best practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To protect the users of the basement from surface water flooding. These details are required within 3 months as they affect the entirety of the construction phase and cannot therefore be dealt with retrospectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to occupation, detailed specification and a drainage layout of at least one suitable sustainable drainage systems (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving, etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume. The development shall be completed in accordance with the .approved details and maintained as such for the lifetime of the development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To reduce the risk of surface water flooding.&lt;/p&gt;",
