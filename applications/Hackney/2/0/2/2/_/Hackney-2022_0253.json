    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed side/rear extension, by reason of its height, depth and position, would result in harm to the amenity of neighbouring residents in respect of loss of light to the lower ground floor of No.38 and an overbearing impact to occupiers of No.38 and 42 to the detriment of their amenity. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth) and D6 (Housing quality and standards) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP2 (Development and amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed side/rear extension, by reason of its depth, scale, massing, detailed design and siting is considered to result in an obtrusive and incongruous addition that would cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the subject property and the Northwold and Cazenove Conservation Area. As such, the proposed development is contrary to policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth), D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
