    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size, scale and detailed design, would fail to be subservient to the host historic building in terms of location, and would fail to respect the host historic building in terms of design, materials and detailing. As such the extension would fail to respect the historic character of the historic building and would fail to conserve or enhance its significance and would fail to preserve or enhance the conservation area.&amp;nbsp; The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policies LP1 and LP3 of the Hackney Local Plan, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"
