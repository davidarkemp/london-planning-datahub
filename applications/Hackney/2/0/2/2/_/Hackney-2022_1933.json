As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D4 (Delivering Good Design) and D8 (Public Realm) of the London Plan (2021) and policies PP1 (Public Realm) and LP7 (Advertisements) of Hackney&#x27;s Local Development Plan (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed advertisement, by reason of its scale, appearance, location and potential uses would result in an obstructive and intrusive form of development that would increase potential loitering, creating blocks and reducing the amount of space available for use by pedestrians and would block lines of sight and create distraction for highway users reducing the safety of the highway. As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D8 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27; of the London Plan (2021) as well as policy PP1 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27;, LP7 &#x27;Advertisements&#x27; and LP42 &#x27;Walking and Cycling&#x27; of the Hackney Local Plan.&lt;/p&gt;"
