    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its size, bulk, massing and inappropriate layout, would fail to be subservient to or to complement the host property, appearing as an incongruous addition that would disrupt the pattern of development and uniformity at the rear of this terraced row, of which the application site forms a part. The proposal is therefore considered unacceptable in design terms and fails to comply with policies LP1 of the Hackney Local Plan, LP33 policy D4 of the London Plan 2021 and the stipulations of the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its height, vulk and overall depth along the shared boundary with no. 20 Colne Road, would have a harmful impact on the amenities enjoyed by residents of this property. In particular the proposal would result in a loss of outlook and would result in an unacceptable sense of enclosure. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan LP33, policy D4 of the London Plan 2021 and the stipulations of the Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;"
