    "&lt;div&gt;The proposal, by reason of its excessive rear projection, would result in loss of light to, and have an overbearing appearance when viewed from, neighbouring properties and give rise to an increased sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers. As such the proposal is contrary to policy D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "The proposal represents a form of development that would, by reason of inappropriate design, represent an overdevelopment of the host building and result in unacceptable loss of garden space, and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host building and Northwold and Cazenove Conservation Area, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the host building and the area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020 and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009."
