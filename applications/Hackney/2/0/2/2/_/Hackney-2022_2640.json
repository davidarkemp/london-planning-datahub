    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;The proposed advertisement, by virtue of its scale, design and positioning, would result in an obtrusive form of development which is harmful to visual amenity insofar as it would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building; the immediate context; the Clapton Square Conservation Area; and the wider streetscene more generally, and thus the visual amenity of the area. As such the proposal is contrary policies D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led), D4 (Delivering Good Design), D8 (Public Realm) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets), LP4 (Non-Designated Heritage Assets) and LP7 (Advertisements) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 (2020).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
