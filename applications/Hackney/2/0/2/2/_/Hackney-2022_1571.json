    "&lt;p&gt;By reason of its inappropriate design and location within a group of properties with an unbroken roofline, the proposed mansard roof extension would result in an incongruous and overly prominent extension that would disrupt the symmetry of this terrace, and would detract from the character of the surrounding area and streetscene. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy LP1 of the Hackney Local Plan (LP33), London Plan policies D3 and D4 and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009.&lt;/p&gt;"
