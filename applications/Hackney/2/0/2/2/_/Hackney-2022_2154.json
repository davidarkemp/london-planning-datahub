    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed CCTV cameras, due to their inappropriate positioning, particularly Camera 6 along the rear elevation at first-floor level, are likely to result in a loss of privacy or perceived overlooking for the residents of no. 45 Lansdowne Drive. This impact would likely be felt both while inside the neighbouring property and while using the rear garden. The proposed development is therefore unacceptable in regard to amenity impact and fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the stipulations of the council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed CCTV cameras, by reason of their excessive number and cluttered appearance, would detract from the original design of the host property when viewed from street level and would fail to preserve or enhance the character of this part of the conservation area. The proposed development is unacceptable in regard to design and fails to comply with policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and policies LP1, LP2, and LP3 of the Hackney Local Plan LP33 (2020).&lt;/p&gt;"
