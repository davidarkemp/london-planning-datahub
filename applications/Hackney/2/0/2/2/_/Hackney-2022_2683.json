    "&lt;p&gt;By reason of insufficient information and the lack of an acoustic assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in noise and disturbance to adjoining residents. The proposal is, therefore, contrary\r\nto policy LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 (2020) and policy D14 (Noise) of the London Plan (2021).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
