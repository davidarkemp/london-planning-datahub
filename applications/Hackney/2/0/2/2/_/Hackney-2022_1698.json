    "&lt;p&gt;By reason of its overly bulky and dominant design, particularly in regard to height, the proposed development would appear out of character with the design of mansard roof extensions in the surrounding area and would be disproportionate in scale to the host property. The development would detract from the streetscene both along Green Lanes and Lidfield Road and would be considered unacceptable. The proposal fails to comply with Policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan (LP33), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the stipulations of the Council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed mansard roof extension, by reason of its location within a group of properties with an unbroken roofline and its excessive size and scale,&amp;nbsp; would result in an incongruous and overly prominent extension that would disrupt the symmetry of the terrace and would detract from the character of the surrounding area and streetscene. The proposal, therefore, fails to comply with policy LP1 of the Hackney Local Plan (LP33), London Plan policies D3 and D4, and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
