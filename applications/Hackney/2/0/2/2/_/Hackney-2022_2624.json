    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed replacement windows to front and rear elevations and enlarged rear window at first floor level, by reason of their size, opening mechanism, detail design and siting would result in an obtrusive and incompatible form of development which would fail to respect the character and appearance of the subject property and the wider terrace. As such, the proposals would be contrary to policies D1 (Londonâ€™s form, character and capacity for growth) and D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained within the Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
