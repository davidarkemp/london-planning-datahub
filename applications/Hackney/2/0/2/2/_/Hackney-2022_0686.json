As such, the proposal is contrary to LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 and policy D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan 2021 and Hackney&#x27;s ‘Residential Extensions and Alterations’ SPD 2009."
