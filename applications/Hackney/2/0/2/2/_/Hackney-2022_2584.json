    "&lt;p&gt;Due to the excessive scale of the proposed extension, in combination with the existing side infill extension,&amp;nbsp; the development would have a significant and detrimental impact on the amenity enjoyed by the neighbouring residents of no. 36 Forburg Road, particularly at basement level. This impact would be experienced most acutely in relation to loss of outlook, loss of daylight/sunlight, and an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal is, therefore, considered unacceptable and fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020), and the stipulations of the Council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;By reason of its excessive scale and awkward roof design, the proposed development would relate poorly to the existing and approved extensions on-site and, in combination with these features, would fail to appear subordinate to the original design of the host property, appearing as overdevelopment. As a result, the proposal fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of this part of the Northwold and Cazenove Conservation Area. The proposal, therefore, fails to comply with policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 and LP3 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020), and the stipulations of the Council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
