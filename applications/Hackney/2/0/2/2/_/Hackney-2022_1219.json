    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed roof terrace by virtue of its siting at second floor and size would result in an incompatible form of development which would fail to relate to the character and appearance of the existing host building, the wider terrace and the Stoke Newington Conservation Area.&amp;nbsp; As such, the proposal would be contrary to HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan (2021) and Policy LP1 (Design qualities and local character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
