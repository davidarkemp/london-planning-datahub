Furthermore, they would restrict the development potential of the adjacent site to the north. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;div&gt;The proposal, by reason of the size and location of windows in the north elevation of the proposed building, would result in light overspill and perceived overlooking of the neighbouring property to the north, No. 1 Stannard Road, to the detriment of the residential amenity of the occupiers of that dwelling. As such the proposal is contrary to policy D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
