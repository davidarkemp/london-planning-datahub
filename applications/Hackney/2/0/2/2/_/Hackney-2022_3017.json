    "The proposed mansard roof extension, by reason of its&nbsp; design and location within a group of properties with an unbroken roofline,&nbsp; would result in an incongruous and overly prominent extension that would disrupt the symmetry of the terrace and would detract from the character of the host building and surrounding area. The proposal, therefore, fails to comply with policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of&nbsp;the Hackney Local Plan (LP33) (2020), Policies D3(Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and D4 (Delivering Good Design) of the London Plan (2021), and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009."
