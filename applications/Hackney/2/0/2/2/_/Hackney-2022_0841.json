    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed rear extension by reason of its design, scale and siting, adjacent to a conservation area, comprises an incongruous form of works resulting in an obtrusive and incompatible form of development which would adversely impact the character and appearance of the site, wider terrace,&amp;nbsp; setting of the Northwold &amp;amp; Cazenove Conservation Area. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach), D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan 2021, policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets), LP4 (Non-Designated Heritage Assets) and LP17 (Housing Design) of the Local Plan 2033 and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed rear extension by reason of its siting, depth and height along the boundary with No.54 Alkham Road would harm the outlook experienced by these neighbouring residents and result in an overbearing sense of enclosure. As such the development is contrary to D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) and LP2&amp;nbsp;(Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 (2020).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed front lightwell and associated works would, by reason of design, scale and location, appear as an unsympathetic and discordant addition to both the host building and wider streetscene, resulting in an adverse impact to character and appearance of the host building and wider area. As such the proposed development is contrary D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), and D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 (2020), and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
