    "&lt;div&gt;The proposal, by reason of the loss of garden space, would result in the total loss of biodiversity habitat, and no significant compensatory biodiversity enhancements have been proposed, to the detriment of biodiversity in the area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D4 (Delivering good design), G5 (Urban Greening) and G6 (Biodiversity and access to nature) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP47 (Biodiversity and Sites of Importance of Nature Conservation) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;div&gt;The proposal, by reason of the intensification of the synagogue use, would give rise to increased traffic and parking in the area, to the detriment of highway safety and parking stress in the area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), D4 (Delivering good design), T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts) and T6 (Car parking) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP2 (Development and Amenity), LP43 (Transport and Development) and LP45 (Parking and Car Free Development) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;div&gt;The proposed development would, by reason of its bulk, scale, mass and design, have an overbearing appearance when viewed from nearby residential premises, result in an increased sense of enclosure and give rise to unacceptable levels of perceived overlooking, to the detriment of the amenities of the occupiers of those premises. As such the proposal is contrary to policy D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;div&gt;The proposal, by reason of the intensification of the synagogue use, would give rise to increased noise and activity at and near the site, to the detriment of the residential amenities of nearby occupiers. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), D4 (Delivering good design) and D14 (Noise) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;div&gt;The proposed development would, by virtue of its bulk, scale, design, location and loss of original fabric, overwhelm and subsume the host building, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and the visual amenity of the area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021, policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020 and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;div&gt;The proposal, by reason of the unjustified loss of residential units and floorspace, would fail to provide replacement housing, to the detriment of the provision of housing in this part of the borough. As such the proposal is contrary to policies H8 (Loss of housing and estate redevelopment) and S1 (Developing London’s social infrastructure) of the London Plan and policies LP8 (Social and Community Infrastructure) and LP24 (Preventing the Loss of Housing) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
