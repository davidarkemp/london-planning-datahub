    "Condition 15: Demolition and Construction Management PlanNotwithstanding the documents hereby approved, no development shall take place (save for the removal by hand of existing windows and brick spandrels on the south elevation, without use of any percussive power tools or percussive machinery, with the safe and secure storage of the removed material on-site) until a detailed Demolition and Construction Management Plan covering the matters set out below only has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall only be carried out in accordance with the details and measures approved as part of the demolition and construction management plan, which shall be maintained throughout the entire construction period. The plan must include:&nbsp;a) A demolition and construction method statement covering all phases of the development to include details of noise control measures and measures to preserve air quality (including a risk assessment of the demolition and construction phase); The statement must also include:i. Details as to how the construction of the development can be carried out without exceeding the following noise and vibration levels at a location (or locations) to be agreed by the Local Planning Authority: 1. NR 15 Leq,15min; 2. 25 dB LAmax; 3. 0.5 mm/s PPV.ii. Details of on-site testing which demonstrates that the construction of the development can be carried out without exceeding the noise and vibration levels set out at part i above.iii. Details of noise and vibration monitoring to be carried out in accordance with the methodology set out in the Acoustic Report by Bureau Veritas dated November 2018. This monitoring data must be made available to the Local Authority when it is requested.&nbsp;iv. A liaison strategy between the applicant and adjacent businesses and property occupiers including a commitment to liaise with neighbours when particularly noisy periods of construction are likely to occur.b) A Dust Management Plan to control dust emissions during demolition and construction;c) Details of compliance with &#39;chapter 7 of the Cleaner Construction Machinery for London: A Low Emission Zone for Non-Road Mobile Machinery&#39; (NRMM) in relation to Only Non Road Mobile Machinery or used at the development site during the demolition and construction process along with details that all NRMM are entered on the Non Road Mobile Machinery online register at https://nrmm.london/user-nrmm/register before being operated. Where NRMM, which does not comply with &#39;chapter 7 of the Cleaner Construction Machinery for London: A Low Emission Zone for NRMM&#39;, is present on site all development work will stop until it has been removed from site.d) A demolition and construction waste management plan setting out how resources will be managed and waste controlled at all stages during a construction project, including, but not limited to, details of dust mitigation measures during site clearance and construction works (including any works of demolition of existing buildings or breaking out or crushing of concrete), the location of any mobile plant machinery, details of measures to be employed to mitigate against noise and vibration arising out of the construction process demonstrating best practical means.e) Details of the location where deliveries will be undertaken; the size and number of lorries expected to access the site daily; the access arrangements (including turning provision if applicable); construction traffic routing; details of parking suspensions (if required) for the duration of construction.&nbsp;REASON: To avoid hazard and obstruction being caused to users of the public highway, in the interest of public safety and amenity, in order to prevent the construction of the development having an unacceptable environmental impact upon neighbouring properties and to protect air quality, human health and to contribute to National Air Quality Objectives."
