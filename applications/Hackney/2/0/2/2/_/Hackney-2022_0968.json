Details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or\nresistance measures against surface water (overland flow) and groundwater (if identified) shall be submitted to\nthe LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the basement is occupied. The\nbasement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS\n8102:2009 code of practice for &quot;protection of below ground structures against water from the ground&quot; and\ncurrent best practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interest of groundwater flooding mitigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
