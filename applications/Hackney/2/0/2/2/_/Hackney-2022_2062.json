The proposal, therefore, fails to comply with policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated heritage assets) of the Hackney Local Plan (LP33) (2020), Policies D3(Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), D4 (Delivering Good Design) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan (2021), and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009, the National Planning Policy Framework and De Beauvoir Conservation Area Appraisal (2008).&lt;/p&gt;"
