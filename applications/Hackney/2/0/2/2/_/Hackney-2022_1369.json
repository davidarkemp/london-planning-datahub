    "&lt;p&gt;No development shall commence, other than works of demolition, until a report (including intrusive investigation/trial pit and monitoring where necessary)\r\ndemonstrating that the basement development will not increase the potential for groundwater flooding to itself or to the surrounding area during and postconstruction has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. Where groundwater is identified as a potential risk, details of appropriate\r\ncontrols including flood resilience and/or resistance measures shall be submitted to the LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the\r\nbasement is occupied. The basement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2022 Protection of\r\nbelow ground structures against water ingress - code of practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To minimise the risk of flooding on site and to neighbouring sites.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification, a drainage layout and a management &amp;amp; maintenance plan (where applicable) of at least one suitable\r\nsustainable drainage system (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the\r\nvegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and\r\nsoakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that\r\nthere will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\r\nREASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system to minimise surface water flooding.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;All new external facing and roofing materials in respect of all the works hereby approved (and any other incidental works carried out in this connection) shall match those of the existing building in respect of materials used, detailed execution and finished appearance unless otherwise shown on the hereby approved plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\r\n\r\nREASON: To protect the design character and appearance of the existing building and other buildings in the streetscene&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The Development hereby permitted shall only be carried out and completed strictly in accordance with the submitted plans hereby approved and any subsequent approval of details.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\r\nREASON: To ensure that the development hereby permitted is carried out in full accordance with the plans hereby approved.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;",
