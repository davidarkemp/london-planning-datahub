    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification and a drainage layout of at least one suitable sustainable drainage systems (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving, etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interest of sustainable urban drainage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

The scheme shall be carried out in its entirety before the basement is occupied and; constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2009 code of practice for &quot;protection of below ground structures against water from the ground&quot; and current best practice where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interest of flood risk mitigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
