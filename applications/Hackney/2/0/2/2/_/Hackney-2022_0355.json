As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D4 (Delivering Good Design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth)of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1 (Design quality and local character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) and LP7 (Advertisements) of Hackney&#x27;s Local Development Plan (2020).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
