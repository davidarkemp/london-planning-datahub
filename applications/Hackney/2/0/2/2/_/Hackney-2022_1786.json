The proposal would, therefore, represent a disproportionate addition to the host property, be out of keeping with the host property and the wider street scene. The proposal fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan LP33 (2020), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the stipulations of the councilâ€™s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed part hip to gable roof form would result in a disjointed form of development that would disrupt the sense of symmetry across the row of semi-detached Victorian properties of which the application forms a part. Further, the proposed rear dormers, by reason of their size and design, would appear excessive in scale, and would utilise inappropriate materiality that would fail to respect the original design of the host dwellinghouse. The proposal is considered unacceptable in regard to design and fails to comply with policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan LP33 (2020), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the stipulations of the council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.&lt;/p&gt;"
