    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed ground floor extensions, by virtue of their size, design, bulk, height and&amp;nbsp; siting, would result in overly large and dominant extensions that fail to respect the\r\ncharacter of the host building and the area generally and which would result in an\r\nunacceptable loss of light, outlook and would have an overbearing impact on the\r\noccupants of no. 17 Durley Road, to the detriment of the amenities of these\r\nneighbouring occupants. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies LP1\r\n(Design Quality and Local Character), and LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the LP33 Hackney\r\nLocal Plan 2020; D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021 and Hackney\r\nResidential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The proposal therefore fails to meet the requirements of the London Plan and LP33. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
