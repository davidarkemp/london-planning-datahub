    "&lt;p&gt;No development shall commence, other than works of demolition, until a report (including intrusive investigation/trial pit and monitoring where necessary) demonstrating that the basement extension will not increase the potential for groundwater flooding to itself or to the surrounding area has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. Details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or resistance measures against surface water (overland flow) and groundwater (if identified) shall be submitted to the LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the basement is occupied. The basement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2009 code of practice for &quot;protection of below ground structures against water from the ground&quot; and current best practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interest of flood risk mitigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interest of sustainable drainage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
