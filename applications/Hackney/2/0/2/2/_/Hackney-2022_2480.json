    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its bulk, massing, scale, detailed design, position and location would result in an obtrusive, unsympathetic and incompatible form of development which adversely disrupts the established grain of the area and would consequently fail to preserve or enhance the site, surrounding streetscape and wider Conservation Area. As such, the proposed development is considered contrary to policies D3 (Optimising Sity Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach), D4 (Delivering Good Design) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth), policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) and LP3 (Non Designated Heritage Assets) of the Local Plan 2033.&lt;/p&gt;",
