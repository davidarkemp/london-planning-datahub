As such the proposal is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach)&amp;nbsp; D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021, policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020 and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009 and the Clapton Square Conservation Area Appraisal 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

    "The proposal, by reason of the additional bulk of the building, would result in it having an overbearing appearance and give rise to perceptions of an increased sense of enclosure and appearance of bulk when viewed from neighbouring properties and also give rise to loss of light to neighbouring buildings, to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring residential occupiers. As such the proposal is contrary to policy D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020."
