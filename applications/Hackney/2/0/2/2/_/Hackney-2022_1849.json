As such, the proposals would be contrary to policies D1 (Londonâ€™s form, character and capacity for growth), D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained with the Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
