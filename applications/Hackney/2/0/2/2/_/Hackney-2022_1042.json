  "description": "We are hoping to install an awning on our shop front to cover our guests in time for spring and summer trading outside. Our shop front is 5.25m long, and the awning would cover the length of our shop front trading licence space - about 2.1-2.4m into the pavement. We are very happy to go with the council&#x27;s preference of awning colour, in keeping with the property and the rest of the street. The awning would only be used on rainy days and folded away every night. ",
