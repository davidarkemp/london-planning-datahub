    "&lt;div&gt;The proposal, by reason of the additional height of the building, would result in it having an overbearing appearance and give rise to perceptions of an increased sense of enclosure and appearance of bulk when viewed from the rear of the building at Nos. 5-7 Heathland Road, and, due to windows in the second floor flank elevation, would give rise to perceived overlooking of neighbouring gardens, to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring residential occupiers. As such the proposal is contrary to policy D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;div&gt;The proposed extensions, by reason of their bulk, scale and height, represent disproportionate additions to the host building that would overwhelm the host building, and the additional height would fail to respect the pattern of development in the area and the hierarchy of building heights, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the area. As such the proposal is contrary to policy D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021, policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020 and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
