    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-154517ec-7fff-7f0f-23af-7b69735b8e70&quot;&gt;The proposed addition of the roof terrace to the southern elevation, by reason of its size, design and position, would result in loss of privacy and increased noise and disturbance to neighbouring windows and their amenity space, resulting in an adverse impact on the living conditions of&amp;nbsp; neighbouring occupiers. As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP2 (Development and amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained within&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementation Planning Document (2009)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development would result in an incongruous extension, by reason of the height, loss of uniform roof form, large amounts of glazing and detailed design, that would disrupt the uniform roofline of this group of apartment buildings and would detract from the character of the host building. The proposal, therefore, fails to comply with policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP17 (Housing Design) of the Hackney Local Plan (LP33) (2020), Policies D3(Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), and D4 (Delivering Good Design) of the London Plan (2021), and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009, and the National Planning Policy Framework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
