    "<p>Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification and a drainage layout of at least one suitable sustainable drainage systems (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving, etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.</p><p>The approved sustainable urban drainage system shall be installed prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved and thereafter retained and maintained.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>REASON: To reduce surface water run-off from the site.</p><p><br></p><div><br></div>",
    "<p>No demolition or development shall take place until a written scheme of investigation (WSI) has been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed WSI, which shall include the statement of significance and research objectives, and</p><p>A. The programme and methodology of site investigation and recording and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works</p><p>B. Where appropriate, details of a programme for delivering related positive public benefits</p><p>C. The programme for post-investigation assessment and subsequent analysis, publication &amp; dissemination and deposition of resulting material.</p><p>This part of the condition shall not be discharged until these elements have been fulfilled in accordance with the programme set out in the WSI</p><p><br></p><p>REASON: Groundworks will expose deposits similar to the archaeologically significant palaeolithic deposits previously exposed nearby and harm to them should be managed according to NPPF and Local Plan policy by means of archaeological investigation.</p><div><br></div>",
    "&lt;p&gt;The green roofs shown on the approved drawings shall be installed using a full depth substrate system of at least 80mm prior to the first occupation of the developmentg hereby permitted and thereafter retained and maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure a suitable green roof is provided.&lt;/p&gt;",

On to this weldmesh panels should be securely fixed with wire or scaffold clamps.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p><p>\nREASON: In order to protect the existing trees during building operation and site works.</p><p><br></p><p>\n</p>",
