In the case of non-compliance the legal Owner shall upon written notice from the Local Planning Authority immediately take all steps reasonably required to remedy noncompliance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. Within four weeks of planning permission being issued by the Local Planning Authority, the Owner is required to submit to the GLA accurate and verified estimates of the ‘be seen’ energy performance indicators, as outlined in Chapter 3 ‘Planning stage’ of the GLA ‘Be seen’ energy monitoring guidance document, for the consented development. This should be submitted to the GLA&#x27;s monitoring portal in accordance with the ‘Be seen’ energy monitoring guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Once the as-built design has been completed (upon commencement of RIBA Stage 6) and prior to the building(s) being occupied (or handed over to a new legal owner, if applicable), the legal Owner is required to provide updated accurate and verified estimates of the ‘be seen’ energy performance indicators for each reportable unit of the development, as per the methodology outlined in Chapter 4 ‘As-built stage’ of the GLA ‘Be seen’ energy monitoring guidance. All data and supporting evidence should be uploaded to the GLA’s monitoring portal. The owner should also confirm that suitable monitoring devices have been installed and maintained for the monitoring of the in-use energy performance indicators, as outlined in Chapter 5 ‘In-use stage’ of the GLA ‘Be seen’ energy monitoring guidance document.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c.
