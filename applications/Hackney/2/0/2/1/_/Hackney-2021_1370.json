    "Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification and a drainage layout of at least one suitable sustainable drainage systems (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving, etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.REASON: To address adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change; provide sustainable urban drainage and manage surface water run-off in a critical drainage area as close to source as possible; enhance biodiversity values; and improve the appearance and resilience of the development.",
    "A scheme for the provision and implementation of flood resilient and resistant construction details and measures for the site against surface water flood risk shall be submitted to and agreed, in writing with the LPA in consultation with the LLFA prior to the construction of the measures. The scheme shall be carried out in its entirety before the extension is occupied and; constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with current best practices.REASON: In the interests of prevention of harm to human health and property as a result of flood."
