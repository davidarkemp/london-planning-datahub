As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP2 (Development and amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed rear roof extension, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk, design and siting would result in obtrusive and incompatible forms of development which would fail to respect the character and appearance of the subject property and surrounding area. As such, the proposals would be contrary to policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth) and D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP1 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained with the Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
