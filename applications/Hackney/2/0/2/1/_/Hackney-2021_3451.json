This harm is considered to be less than substantial in terms of Paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework, and there are no public benefits to outweigh this harm.&nbsp; The development is deemed contrary to London Plan Policy HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth), Hackney Local Plan (LP33) Policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets).<br></p>"
