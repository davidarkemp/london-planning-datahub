All soft landscaping in accordance with the scheme, when approved, shall be carried out within a period of twelve months from the date on which the development of the site commences or shall be carried out in the first planting (and seeding) season following completion of the development, and shall be maintained in perpetuity, such maintenance to include the replacement of any plants that die, or are severely damaged, seriously diseased, or removed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To enhance the character, appearance and ecology of the development and contribution to green infrastructure and ensure the protection of habitats of biodiversity value.&lt;/p&gt;",
