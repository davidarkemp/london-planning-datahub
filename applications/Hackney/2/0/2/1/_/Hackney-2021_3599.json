    "&lt;p&gt;No&amp;nbsp;development shall commence, other than works of demolition until full detailed specification of the sustainable drainage system (above ground green SuDS) supported by appropriate calculations, construction details, drainage layout and a site-specific management and maintenance plan has been provided. Details shall include but not limited to the proposed green roof (with a substrate depth of at least 80mm not including vegetative mats), rainwater harvesting system and permeable pavements, which shall be submitted and approved by the LPA in consultation with the LLFA. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume close to greenfield runoff where feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system.
