    "&lt;p&gt;No development shall take place until a detailed Demolition and Construction Management Plan covering the matters set out below has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

This should include monitoring of particulate matter at the application site boundary in the direction of sensitive receptors following the SPG Mayor of London Control of Dust and Emissions Guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To avoid hazard and obstruction being caused to users of the public highway and in the interest of public safety and amenity.

Measures and details should include but are not limited to floodproof doors, groundwater pumps and slot drains to intercept overland flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interest of flood risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;",
