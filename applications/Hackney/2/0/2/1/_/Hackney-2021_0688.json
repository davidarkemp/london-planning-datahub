    "All new external finishes in respect of all the works hereby approved (and any other incidental works to be carried out in this connection) shall match the existing building in respect of materials used, detailed execution and finished appearance, unless otherwise stated on the drawings hereby approved.REASON: To ensure that the external appearance of the building is satisfactory and does not detract from the character and visual amenity of the area.",
    "No development shall commence, other than works of demolition, until a report (including intrusive investigation/trial pit and monitoring where necessary) demonstrating that the extension development will not increase the potential for groundwater flooding to itself or to the surrounding area has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. Details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or resistance measures against surface water and groundwater (if identified) shall be submitted to the LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the extension is occupied.REASON: In the interests of prevention of harm to human health and property as a result of flood.",
    "Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification and a drainage layout of at least one suitable sustainable drainage systems (i.e. water butt, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving, etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.REASON: To address adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change; provide sustainable urban drainage and manage surface water run-off in a critical drainage area as close to source as possible; enhance biodiversity values; and improve the appearance and resilience of the development."
