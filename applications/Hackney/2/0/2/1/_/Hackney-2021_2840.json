    "Tree protection for all retained trees at the site and on adjacent land shall be undertaken in accordance with BS5837:2012 (Trees in relation to construction - Recommendations) and will protect the root protection area calculated as described in Table 2 of that British Standard for the duration of all site works (including demolition) undertaken in connection with the development hereby approved.The protective fencing will be 2.4m high and conform to Figure 2 of BS5837:2012 i.e. a scaffold framework comprising a vertical and horizontal framework, well braced to resist impacts, with vertical tubes spaced at a maximum interval of 3m.&nbsp; On to this weldmesh panels should be securely fixed with wire or scaffold clamps.REASON: In order to protect the existing trees during building operation and site works.",
    "No development shall take place until an Arboricultural Method Statement has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The statement shall detail mitigation methods such as replanting and landscaping to be employed in order to protect existing trees from excavation and construction impacts. The development shall only be implemented in accordance with the details and measures approved as part of the Arboricultural Method Statement.REASON: In order to protect the existing trees during building operation and site works.",
    "Prior to occupation of the development hereby approved, a policy compliant cycle parking plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. This shall include details of layout, foundation, stand type and spacing. Thereafter, cycle parking shall be maintained and managed in accordance with the approved plan.REASON: In order to ensure the adequate and timely provision of cycle parking, which is kept in good working condition in perpetuity.",
    "Prior to occupation of the development hereby approved, a Parking Design and Management Plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The Parking Design and Management Plan shall indicate how the car parking will be designed and managed, with reference to Transport for London guidance on parking management and parking design. Disabled person’s parking bays should be shown on the Parking Design and Management Plan and should be located less than 50 metres from the site entrances. Thereafter, parking shall be managed in accordance with the approved plan.&nbsp;REASON: In order to ensure that parking is managed in a safe and efficient manner and to safeguard the needs of all road users.",
    "No development shall take place until a detailed Construction Logistics Plan Statement (CLP) has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. This should be in line with TfL CLP guidance: http://content.tfl.gov.uk/construction-logistics-plan-guidance.pdfThe development shall only be implemented in accordance with the details and measures approved as part of the Construction Logistics Plan Statement, which shall be maintained throughout the entire construction period.&nbsp;&nbsp;REASON: To avoid hazard and obstruction being caused to users of the public highway and in the interest of public safety and amenity and to mitigate the negative impact on the surrounding highway network.&nbsp;",
    "All new external finishes in respect of all the works hereby approved (and any other incidental works to be carried out in this connection) shall match the existing building in respect of materials used, detailed execution and finished appearance, unless otherwise stated on the drawings hereby approved.REASON: To ensure that the external appearance of the building is satisfactory and does not detract from the character and visual amenity of the area.",

    "Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification and a drainage layout of at least one suitable sustainable drainage systems (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving, etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.REASON: To address adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change; provide sustainable urban drainage and manage surface water run-off as close to source as possible; enhance biodiversity values; and improve the appearance and resilience of the development.",
    "Prior to occupation of the development hereby approved, a Delivery and Servicing Management Plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. Thereafter, deliveries and servicing shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plan.REASON: In order to ensure that delivery and servicing does not impact the amenity of neighbouring occupiers and the safe and efficient operation of the highway.",
