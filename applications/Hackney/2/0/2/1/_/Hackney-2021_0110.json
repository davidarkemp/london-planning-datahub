    "All new external finishes in respect of all the works hereby approved (and any other incidental works to be carried out in this connection) shall match the existing building in respect of materials used, detailed execution and finished appearance, unless otherwise stated on the drawings hereby approved.REASON: To ensure that the external appearance of the building is satisfactory and does not detract from the character and visual amenity of the area.",
    "A scheme for the provision and implementation of flood resilient and resistant construction details and measures for the extension against surface water and groundwater flood risk shall be submitted to and agreed, in writing with the LPA in consultation with the LLFA prior to the construction of the measures. The scheme shall be carried out in its entirety before the extension is occupied and; constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2009 code of practice for &#34;protection of below ground structures against water from the ground&#34; and BS 8582:2013 code of practice for &#34;surface water management for development sites&#34; where applicable.REASON: In the interests of prevention of harm to human health and property as a result of flood.",
    "Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification and a drainage layout of at least one suitable sustainable drainage systems (i.e. water butt, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume for all return periods up to the 1 in 100 year storm events plus an allowance for climate change.REASON: To address adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change; provide sustainable urban drainage and manage surface water run-off in a critical drainage area as close to source as possible; enhance biodiversity values; and improve the appearance and resilience of the development.",
