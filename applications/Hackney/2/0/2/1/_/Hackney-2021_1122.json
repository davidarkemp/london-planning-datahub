    "The design of the proposal, by reason of the\r\nbulk, scale, mass and height of the extension, would interrupt the transition\r\nbetween the terraces to the north and to the south, and would fail to be a\r\nsubordinate addition to the host building, to the detriment of the visual\r\namenity of the development and would result in less than substantial harm to\r\nthe Victoria Park Conservation Area which is not outweighed by a sufficient\r\npublic benefit. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D4 (Delivering\r\ngood design) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021,\r\npolicies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage\r\nAssets) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020 and the guidance in the adopted Supplementary\r\nPlanning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the bulk, scale, mass\r\nand height of the extension, would result in loss of light to the property to\r\nthe north and would have an increased perception of bulk and increased sense of\r\nenclosure, to the detriment of the residential amenity of the neighbouring\r\noccupiers. As such the proposal is contrary to policy D4 (Delivering good\r\ndesign) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local\r\nCharacter) and LP2 (Development and Amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020."
