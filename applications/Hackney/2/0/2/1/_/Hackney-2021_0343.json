Tree protection shall be designed and undertaken in accordance with British Standard 5837:2012 - Trees in Relation to Design, Demolition and Construction - Recommendations, to safeguard root protection areas. The tree protection measures shall conform to the recommendations in the Arboricultural Impact Assessment, by Tamla Trees, April 2021.REASON: To provide adequate tree protection and reasonable environmental standards in the interests of the appearance of the site and area.",

    "Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification and a drainage layout of at least one suitable sustainable drainage systems (i.e. water butt, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume for all return periods up to the 1 in 100 year storm events plus an allowance for climate change.REASON: To address adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change; provide sustainable urban drainage and manage surface water run-off in a critical drainage area as close to source as possible; enhance biodiversity values; and improve the appearance and resilience of the development."
