    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification, a drainage layout and a management &amp;amp; maintenance plan (where applicable) of at least one suitable sustainable drainage system (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure that the proposal does not contribute to local flood risk.&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The roof of the rear extension hereby approved shall not be used as a terrace, balcony or similar amenity area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interests of neighbours amenity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Full details, with samples, of the brick to be used on the external surfaces of the extension, shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority in writing before the relevant work on the site is commenced. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure that the external appearance of the building is satisfactory and does not detract from the character and visual amenity of the site.&lt;/p&gt;",
