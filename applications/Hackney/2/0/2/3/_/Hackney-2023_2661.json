  "description": "T3 Pittosporum\r\n1A John Campbell Road\r\nThe pittosporum was planted as an ornamental shrub in 2005 and is now approximately 8m tall with a canopy spread of approximately 4m; it\r\nflowers in spring but doesnâ€™t produce berries. It is evergreen and so limits the light received to adjacent planting including the mature native\r\nelder and conference pear tree, as well as a wildlife pond. It is considered that the benefits to biodiversity of its removal will outweigh the\r\nbenefits of its own support of wildlife. It is proposed to fell this tree to the ground but to retain all timber on site for biodiversity benefit. It is not\r\nproposed to replace this tree as the garden is already overcrowded.\r\nT4 Elder\r\n1A John Campbell Road\r\nThe healthy self-seeded elder is approximately 30 years old and leaning away from the boundary walls against which it grows; it is important\r\nto maintain a small canopy to ensure its survival given its precarious position. It is proposed to reduce its canopy diameter to about 30% of its\r\ncurrent size.\r\nT5 Ash\r\n7 John Campbell Road\r\nThe tree is located in a small back garden and has a very large canopy which is severely reducing sunlight and daylight received by no.s 1, 3,\r\n5, 7 and 9 John Campbell Road. Despite minor evidence of ash dieback it is proposed to retain the tree, and pollard it back to 50% of its\r\ncanopy diameter and to continue regular pruning to manage its size. Leaf litter is to be collected to help reduce the spread of the fungus. The\r\nlarger of the timber sections will be retained on site to support biodiversity.&nbsp;",
