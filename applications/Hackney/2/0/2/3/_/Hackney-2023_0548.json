If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.REASON: To ensure that the future occupants/users of the site will be protected from the identified flood risks.",
    "Prior to the commencement of works for each section of the development or stage in the development - as may be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority (LPA) - a scheme including the following components to address the risk associated with site contamination shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the LPA.&nbsp;A preliminary risk assessment which has identified all previous uses, potential contaminants associated with those uses (including asbestos, landfill gas, ground water contaminants); a conceptual model of the site indicating sources, pathways and receptors; and potentially unacceptable risks arising from contamination at the site.A site investigation scheme based on (a) to provide information for a detailed assessment of the risk to all receptors that may be affected, including those off site;The results of the investigation and detailed risk assessment referred &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to in (b) and, based on these, in the event that remediation measures are identified necessary, a remediation strategy giving full details of the remediation measures required and how they are to be undertaken;A verification plan providing details of the data that will be collected in order to demonstrate that the works set out in the remediation strategy in (c) are complete and identifying and requirements for the longer monitoring of pollution linkages, maintenance and arrangements for contingency action.Any investigation and risk assessment must be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the Environment Agencyâs Land Contamination Risk Management (LCRM ). If additional significant contamination is found at any time when carrying out the approved development, it must be reported in writing immediately to the LPA.&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, this condition can be discharged on a section by section basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;REASON: To ensure the risks from land contamination to the future users of the land and neighbouring land are minimised, together with those to controlled waters, property and ecological systems, and to ensure that the development can be carried out safely without unacceptable risks to workers, neighbours and other offsite receptors.",
