Where groundwater is identified as a potential risk, details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or resistance measures shall be submitted to the LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the basement is occupied. The basement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2022 Protection of below ground structures against water ingress - code of practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure that the proposal does not contribute to groundwater flooding in the local area.&lt;/p&gt;",

If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved and shall be maintained as such thereafter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure that the proposal does not contribute to surface water flooding in the local area.&lt;/p&gt;",
