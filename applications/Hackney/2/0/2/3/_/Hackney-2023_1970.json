As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D8 &#39;Public Realm&#39; of the London Plan (2021) as well as policy PP1 &#39;Public Realm&#39;, LP7 &#39;Advertisements&#39; and LP42 &#39;Walking and Cycling&#39; of the Hackney Local Plan.",
    "The proposed advertisement would represent an incongruous visual intrusion to the street scene and contribute to an unsightly proliferation and clutter of signage and street furniture in the local area that would detract from the visual amenity of the street scene and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D4 (Delivering Good Design) and D8 (Public realm) of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP1 (Design quality and local character) and LP7 (Advertisements) of Hackney&#39;s Local Development Plan (2020)."
