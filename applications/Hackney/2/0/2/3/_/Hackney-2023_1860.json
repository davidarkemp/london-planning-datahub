    "&lt;p&gt;No development shall commence, other than works of demolition, until a report (including intrusive investigation/trial pit and monitoring where necessary) demonstrating that the basement development will not increase the potential for groundwater flooding to itself or to the surrounding area during and post-construction has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. Where groundwater is identified as a potential risk, details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or resistance measures shall be submitted to the LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the basement is occupied. The basement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2022 Protection of below ground structures against water ingress - code of practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In order to reduce the risk of flooding in accordance with LP53 of the Local Plan and SI12 of the London Plan 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification, a drainage layout and a management &amp;amp; maintenance plan (where applicable)&amp;nbsp; of at least one suitable sustainable drainage system (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In order to reduce the risk of surface water run off and therefore accord with LP53 of the Local Plan and SI12 of the London Plan 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
