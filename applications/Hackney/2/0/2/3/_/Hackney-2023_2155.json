    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed advertisement, by reason of its scale, appearance, location and method of illumination would result in an obstructive and intrusive form of development that would obstruct the pavement, reduce the amount of space available for use by pedestrians, block lines of sight creating blind spots and create distractions for highway users reducing the safety of the highway. As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D8 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27; of the London Plan (2021) as well as policy PP1 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27;, LP7 &#x27;Advertisements&#x27;, LP41 &#x27;Liveable Neighbourhoods&#x27; and LP42 &#x27;Walking and Cycling&#x27; of the Hackney Local Plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach), D4 (Delivering Good Design), D8 (Public Realm) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan (2021) and policies PP1 (Public Realm), PP2 (Dalston) LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) and LP7 (Advertisements) of Hackney&#x27;s Local Plan 2033 (2020) and the Hackney Public Realm SPD (2012).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
