    "No development shall commence, other than works of demolition, site clearance and utilities diversions works until full detailed specification of the sustainable drainage system supported by appropriate calculations, construction details, a drainage layout and a site-specific management and maintenance plan of the drainage system including the rainwater harvesting system, biodiverse blue/green/brown roof (with substrate depth of at least 80mm not including vegetative mats), rain garden, permeable paving, underground attenuation system and the flow control system have been submitted and approved by the LPA in consultation with the LLFA. The sustainable drainage system shall achieve the greenfield runoff rates and must not exceed three times the greenfield runoff rates as prescribed in the London Plan for all corresponding return periods up to the 1 in 100 year storm events plus an allowance for climate change. Prior to occupation of the development hereby approved, a strategy which demonstrates how any SuDS and/or attenuation features will be suitably maintained for the lifetime of the development will be submitted and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details."
