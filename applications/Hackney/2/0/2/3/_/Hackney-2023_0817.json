    "The proposed&nbsp;excavation to create a front basement lightwell would, by reason of design, scale and location, appear&nbsp;as an unsympathetic and discordant addition to both the host building and wider terrace of which it forms part, resulting in an adverse impact to the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding streetscape. As such the proposed development is contrary D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), and D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033 (2020), and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009)."
