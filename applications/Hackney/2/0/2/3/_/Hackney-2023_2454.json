  "description": "The tree is a magnolia situated within a garden plot that it has now outgrown. It requires regular, extremely expensive pruning to keep it under\r\ncontrol. Over the years, pruning has caused the tree&#x27;s foliage to become increasingly dense, to the point that the canopy has now become\r\nimpenetrable and is severely restricting the light entering the front of the property. Any pruning required to reduce the tree would need to be\r\ndrastic and would, frankly, destroy the shape and integrity of the tree. To a certain extent, this has already happened. Further pruning will only\r\nexacerbate the situation. \r\nWe would like Lancaster Gardening, a reputable arborist company, to carry out a complete removal of the tree to enable us to plant species\r\nmore appropriate for the size of the garden plot, and increase the light into the property. Lancaster Gardening support our application to\r\nremove the tree",
