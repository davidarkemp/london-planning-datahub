If applicable it should also detail the flu location and termination point, monthly demand profiles, expected reductions in carbon emissions and&lt;br&gt;details on how the system will be managed. If a different technology is to be adopted in the energy centre, or a connection to District Heat Network is available, expected reductions in carbon emissions should be calculated with current SAP10 (or a justified alternative) carbon emission factors. Any shortfall in the carbon emission reductions proposed in the application should be agreed with a cash in lieu payment to the Carbon Offset fund or provided off-site. B) Prior to the occupation of the development hereby approved, full details of the installed&lt;br&gt;and commissioned CHP system (or any system that may replace it) and Energy Centre are in agreement to specifications previously approved, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;REASON: To ensure the development meets the sustainability requirements of the London Plan&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment: The submitted details satisfy the requirements of condition 20 of 2019/2116.&amp;nbsp;The development shall thereafter be implemented and maintained in complete\r\naccordance with the approved details. The approved details in relation to this condition are\r\nconsidered to be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combined Service Energy Centre, Kennaway Estate Stage 4A Dwg No. KEN-RAM-BX-00-DR-05018 Rev T01 Dated 14/06/2023 by Ramboll&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Services Heating Sys General Arrangement Sixth Floor Dwg No. KEN-RAM-BX-06-DR-M-05607 Rev T01 Dated 05/06/2023 by Ramboll&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kennaway Estate - Schedule of Boiler Flues Mechanical Equipment Schedule Rev T01 June 2023 by Ramboll&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Services Heating Sys Schematic Dwg No. KEN-RAM-BX-XX-DR-M-05602 Rev T01 Dated 13/06/2023 by Ramboll&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical Services Heating Sys Boiler Room Schematic Dwg No. KEN-RAM-BX-XX-DR-M-05601 Rev T01 Dated 13/06/2023 by Ramboll&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kennaway Estate Schedule of CHPS - Mechanical Equipment Schedule Rev T01 Date June 2023 by Ramboll&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
