As such the proposed development is contrary to policy D8 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27; of the London Plan (2021) as well as policy PP1 &#x27;Public Realm&#x27;, LP7 &#x27;Advertisements&#x27; and LP42 &#x27;Walking and Cycling&#x27; of the Hackney Local Plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D4 (Delivering Good Design) and D8 (Public Realm) of the London Plan (2021) and policies PP1 (Public Realm) and LP7 (Advertisements) of Hackney&#x27;s Local Development Plan (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
