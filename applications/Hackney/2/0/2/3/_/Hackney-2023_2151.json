As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D4 (Delivering Good Design), D8 (Public Realm) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan (2021) and policies PP1 (Public Realm), LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) and LP7 (Advertisements) of Hackney&#x27;s Local Development Plan (2020).&lt;/p&gt;",
