The\r\nscheme shall be carried out in its entirety before the basement is occupied and; constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with\r\nBS 8102:2009 code of practice for &quot;protection of below ground structures against water from the ground&quot; and current best practice where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To mitigate against the impacts of surface water flooding.&lt;/p&gt;",
