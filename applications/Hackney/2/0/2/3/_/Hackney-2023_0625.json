The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 at the nearest and/or most affected noise sensitive premises, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity. A post installation noise assessment shall be carried out to confirm compliance with the required sound criteria and additional steps to mitigate noise shall be taken as necessary. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently maintained. The plant shall be serviced regularly in accordance with manufacturerâ€™s instructions and as necessary to ensure that the requirements of the condition are maintained. If at any time the plant is determined by the Local Planning Authority to be failing to comply with this condition, it shall be switched off and not used again until it is able to comply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from machinery and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;",
