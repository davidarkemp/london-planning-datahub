As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) and D4 (Delivering Good Design) of the London Plan 2021, policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of the Local Plan 2033 and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009."
