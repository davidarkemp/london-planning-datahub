As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D4 (Delivering Good Design),&amp;nbsp; D8 (Public Realm) and HC1 (Heritage Growth and Conservation)&amp;nbsp;of the London Plan (2021) and policies PP1 (Public Realm), LP1 (High Quality Design), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets)&amp;nbsp;and LP7 (Advertisements) of Hackney&#x27;s Local Development Plan (2020).&lt;/p&gt;",
