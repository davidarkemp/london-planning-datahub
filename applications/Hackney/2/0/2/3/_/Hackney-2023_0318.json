As such the proposed development is contrary to policies&nbsp; D1 (Londonâ€™s form, character, and capacity for growth), D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), and D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP1 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained in the Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2009)."
