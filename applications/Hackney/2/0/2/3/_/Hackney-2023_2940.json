    "&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a suitable undertaking to secure that the occupiers of the new residential units would not be able to apply for on street parking permit, the proposals would have an adverse impact on street parking conditions, highway safety and sustainable modes of transport, contrary to Policies T1 and T4 of the London Plan (2021) and Hackney Local Plan LP33 (2021) Policies LP43 and LP45.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of lack of provision of affordable housing, would fail to adequately contribute towards the provision of mixed and balanced communities and housing need in the local area. As such, the development would not be consistent with Policies H4 and H5 of the London Plan (2021), Hackney Local Plan Policies LP33 (2020) LP12, LP13 and NPPF (2023) paragraph 63 and the Hackney S106 Planning Contributions Supplementary Planning Document (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

As such, the proposal would neither preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Mare Conservation Area and would therefore conflict with Policies D1, D3, D4 &amp;amp; HC1 of The London Plan (2021), Policy LP1 &amp;amp; LP3 of the Hackney Local Plan LP33 (2020) and the Councilâ€™s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
