    "&lt;p&gt;The proposal, by reason of the introduction of a mezzanine floor, would disrupt the historic plan form, features, and fabric of the host building and would, therefore, fail to conserve and enhance significance to the detriment of the special architectural and historic interest of the building and which would not be outweighed by any sufficient public benefit. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), D4 (Delivering good design), and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
