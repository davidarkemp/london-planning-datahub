    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to contribute towards the Carbon Offset Fund, would fail to meet the London Objective of being a zero-carbon city by 2050, contrary to policies SI 2 (Minimising greenhouse gas emissions) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP55 (Mitigating Climate Change) of Hackneyâs Local Plan 2033 (2020) and Hackney&#x27;s S106 Planning Contributions SPD (2020).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
