    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to contribute towards the Carbon Offset Fund, would fail to meet the London Objective of being a zero-carbon city by 2050, contrary to policies SI 2 (Minimising greenhouse gas emissions) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP55 (Mitigating Climate Change) of Hackney’s Local Plan 2033 (2020) and Hackney&#x27;s S106 Planning Contributions SPD (2020).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure car-free housing, would be likely to promote the use of non-sustainable modes of transport and contribute to air pollution and congestion in the surrounding area, contrary to policies T6 (Car Parking) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP45 (Parking and Car Free Development) of Hackney’s Local Plan 2033 (2020) and Hackney&#x27;s S106 Planning Contributions SPD (2020).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, in the absence of a legal agreement to secure a contribution towards affordable housing fails to deliver the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing and is therefore contrary to Policy H4 (Delivering affordable housing) of the London Plan (2021) and Policy LP13 (Affordable housing) of Hackney’s Local Plan 2033 (2020) and Hackney&#x27;s S106 Planning Contributions SPD (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of poor layout and inadequate space would result in the provision of inadequate and unsuitable cycle parking. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies T1 (Strategic Approach to Transport), T4 (Assessing and Mitigating Transport Impacts) and T5 (Cycling) of the London Plan 2021, policies LP42 (Walking and Cycling) and LP43 (Transport and Development) of the Local Plan 2033 and the guidance contained within Hackney Transport Strategy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

As such, the proposed change of use fails to comply with Policy D13 of the London Plan (2021).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
