    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed advertisement, by reason of its scale, siting, appearance and method of illumination would result in an obtrusive and visually incongruous feature that contributes to an unsightly proliferation and clutter of signage and street furniture in the local area that would detract from the visual amenity of the street scene, adversely impacting the setting of the adjoining locally listed building (92-100 Stoke Newington Road) and failing to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Dalston Conservation Area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D4 (Delivering Good Design), D8 (Public Realm) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan (2021) and policies PP1 (Public Realm), LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets), LP4 (Non Designated Heritage Assets) and&amp;nbsp;LP7 (Advertisements) of Hackney&#x27;s Local Development Plan (2020).&lt;/p&gt;",
