    "&lt;p&gt;A scheme for the provision and implementation of flood resilient and resistant construction details and measures for the site against surface water flood risk shall be submitted to and agreed, in writing with the LPA in consultation with the LLFA prior to the construction of the measures. The scheme shall be carried out in its entirety before the extension is occupied and; constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with current best practices.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\r\nREASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system. The condition is required to be discharged prior to the commencement of development to ensure that sustainable drainage is incorporated into the design of the development.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification, a drainage layout and a management &amp;amp; maintenance plan (where applicable) of at least one other suitable sustainable drainage system (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\r\nREASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system.
