    "&lt;p&gt;Prior to the commencement of the relevant part of the work, the applicant shall submit, and have approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, a detailed layout, cross sections (scale 1:20), full specifications and a detailed management and maintenance plan of the biodiverse roof with a minimum substrate depth of 80mm, not including the vegetative mat. The development shall not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the details thus approved and shall be fully implemented before the premises are first occupied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure that the development will provide a sustainable drainage system. The condition is required to be discharged prior to the commencement of development to ensure that sustainable drainage is incorporated into the design of the development&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification, a drainage layout and a management &amp; maintenance plan (where applicable) of at least one suitable sustainable drainage system (i.e. water butt with overflow, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.REASON: To ensure the provision of suitable SUDS onsite to aid in reducing surface water."
