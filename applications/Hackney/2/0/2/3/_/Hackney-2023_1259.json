The rest of the tree can be as is no need to reduce etc.\r\nSafely reducing the height of the main stem in question by structurally pollarding down it down by approx 8m. reduce the ivy another 2m lower\r\nto allow the pollarded main stem to open up back into growth. It will just mean all the spready weight has been taken off it making it lighter and\r\nvery little if any wind movement or resistence to expand the life of the stem with safety as the main focus and priority. \r\nPlease note. to inspect the base of the tree and follow the line going upwards. Its a weak point and when time comes the entire stem will split\r\nof the main tree",
