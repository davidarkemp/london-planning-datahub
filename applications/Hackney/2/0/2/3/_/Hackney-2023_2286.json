    "The proposed rear roof dormer extension and outrigger roof extension, by reason of their excessive scale, bulk, design and siting would result in an obtrusive and incompatible form of development which would fail to respect the character and appearance of the subject property and the Northwold and Cazenove Conservation Area. As such, the proposals would be contrary to policies D1 (Londonâ€™s form, character and capacity for growth), D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020)."
