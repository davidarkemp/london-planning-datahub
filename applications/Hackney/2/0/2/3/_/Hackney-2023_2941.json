    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its unjustified loss of historic fabric and subsequent bulk, massing, scale, detailed design, position and location, would result in an incongruous and incompatible form of development that would have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the grade II listed building. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1, policies LP1, LP3 of the Local Plan 2033 and the NPPF (2023).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
