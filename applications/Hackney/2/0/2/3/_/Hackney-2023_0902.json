    "The proposed outrigger roof extension, by reason of it&#39;s design, scale and siting, would result in an overly&nbsp; dominant and incongruous addition that would not appear subservient to the host dwelling and adversely impact upon the character and appearance of the site and wider adjoining terrace. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies&nbsp; D1 (Londonâ€™s form, character, and capacity for growth), D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), and D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP1 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained in the Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document (2009)."
