As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan 2021, LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP4 (Non Designated Heritage Assets) and LP17 (Housing Design) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033, and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D4 (Delivering Good Design) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan 2021, LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP4 (Non Designated Heritage Assets) and LP17 (Housing Design) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033, and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
