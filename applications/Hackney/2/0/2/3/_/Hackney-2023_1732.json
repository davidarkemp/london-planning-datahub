  "description": "Felling of two plane trees (T1 and T2) at the front of the property due to: root structural damage of property, wall and pavement impact, long term impact which could include road damage, desire to improve presentation of property, desire to create green space for community and visitors. The trees border the pavement alongside homerton high street.Our proposal is that we remove the two trees and then repair the wall and paving slabs within the property boundary. This would make the front of the property accessible and safe as well as improve the the appearance at the front of the property. Currently the damage from the roots is pushing through the bricks of the wall and could at some point affect the pavement. although pollarding has been completed to prevent this, because of the scale of the tree the roots will continue to grow causing further damage. we would like to replace these trees with 2 smaller pollinator trees with a good level of blossom as part of a property project to improve the outdoor space for our community and visitors, as well as encourage wildlife like pollinators in the area as well as improve on the presentation standards. we aim to have a place which is welcoming to the community and is a safe and beautiful place to take part in.&nbsp;",
