Details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or resistance measures against surface water (overland flow) and groundwater (if identified) shall be submitted to the LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the basement is occupied. The basement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2022 Protection of below ground structures against water ingress - code of practice.REASON: To mitigate against the impacts of surface water flooding.",

If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.REASON: To mitigate against the impacts of surface water flooding.",
