The scheme shall be carried out in its entirety before the basement is occupied and; constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2009 code of practice for &quot;protection of below ground structures against water from the ground&quot; and current best practice where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In the interest of flood risk mitigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration.
