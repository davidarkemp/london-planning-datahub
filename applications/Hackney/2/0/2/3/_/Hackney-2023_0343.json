    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed extension, by reason of its height and depth along the common boundary, would result in an unneighbourly form of development on the occupiers of 68 Kenworthy Road. The extension would have an overbearing impact on its neighbour that would result in a loss of outlook,&amp;nbsp; and an increased sense of enclosure and tunnelling effect on this property. The proposal is therefore contrary to LP2 (development and amenity) of Hackney&#x27;s Local Plan LP33 (2020) and the Residential and Extensions SPD 2009. Prior approval is therefore required and refused.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
