As such, the proposed development is contrary to policies D1 (Londonâ€™s form, character and capacity for growth), D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and&nbsp; HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020)."
