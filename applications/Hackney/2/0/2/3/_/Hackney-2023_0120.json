    "The proposed dormer by reason of its design, siting and scale within the group of locally listed buildings would result in an incompatible and obtrusive form of development which would adversely affect the character and appearance of the building and wider locally listed group of terraced dwellings it forms part of and the conservation area.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As a result the proposal would neither preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Albion Square conservation area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan, policy D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan, and the Hackney, &#x27;Residential Extensions and Alterations&#x27; SPD 2009 and the NPPF paragraph 202.",
