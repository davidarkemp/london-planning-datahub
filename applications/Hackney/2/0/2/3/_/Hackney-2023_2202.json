    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed rear extension by virtue of its depth, height and siting would have a detrimental impact on the amenity enjoyed by the neighbouring occupiers at No.39 Penhurst Road in respect of loss of outlook, an increased sense of enclosure and loss of light. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth) and D6 (Housing quality and standards) of the London Plan (2021) and policy LP2 (Development and amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development in respect of the replacement rear window and rear dormer, by reason of their size, design and location, would result in an incompatible form of development, which would adversely affect the character and appearance of the host building, the wider terrace within which it is located and the historic and architectural interest of the adjoining Locally Listed Buildings. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to the policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth), D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), D4 (Delivering good design) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and growth) of the London Plan (2021) and Policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP4 (Non Designated Heritage Assets) of Hackney’s Local Plan 2033 (2020) and the relevant sections Hackney’s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
