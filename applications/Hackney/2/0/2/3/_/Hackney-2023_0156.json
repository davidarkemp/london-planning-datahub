    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its excessive height, scale, massing and siting would result in a dominant and incompatible form of development which harms the character of the host building and competes with the hierarchy of the adjacent historic buildings. As such the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Clapton Square Conservation Area. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D3 (Optimising Site Capacity through the Design-led Approach) and HC1 (Heritage Conservation and Growth) of the London Plan 2021, LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) and LP17 (Housing Design) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033, and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;/p&gt;"
