    "Prior to superstructure works, detailed specification, a drainage layout, and a management &amp; maintenance plan (where applicable) of at least one suitable sustainable drainage system (i.e. water butt with overflow, rain garden, bio-retention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving, etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.REASON: In the interests of preventing surface water flooding.",
