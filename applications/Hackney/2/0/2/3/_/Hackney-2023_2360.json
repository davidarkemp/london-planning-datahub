  "description": "We would like to remove a leylandii tree in the front garden of our property. It is the only tree located in the small (3.5meters deep x 8meters\r\nwide) front garden. This tree is all that&#x27;s left of a leylandii front hedge as the other shrubs died. It has now overgrown its site and its base is\r\nonly 3meters from the foundations of both 144 and 146. The tree is now some 12 meters high (higher than the house itself) and we fear its\r\nclose proximity to the houses could cause the foundations of these 1860&#x27;s houses to crumble. Total removal is requested. We would\r\nshred/chip the foilage and branches to use as mulch to the front and rear gardens and use the cut logs as boarder definition in the rear garden\r\nso that there would be no waste or need to remove material from site. There is a mature council Birch tree in the footpath area in front of 144\r\nand so there is no loss of tree coverage to the immediate area.",
