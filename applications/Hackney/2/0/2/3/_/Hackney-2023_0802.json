    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size, scale, and contrived appearance, would result in a disproportionate and incongruous extension that would be out of character with rear extensions in the surrounding area and would fail to complement the host building. The proposal, therefore, fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 and LP2 of the Local Plan (LP33), and the stipulations of the Council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;In the absence of sufficient evidence to demonstrate the contrary,&amp;nbsp; the development could have a harmful impact on the long-term health of the mature tree located along the rear boundary of the site and the overall biodiversity of the site. This tree contributes to the biodiversity and visual of the surrounding area. The proposed development, therefore, fails to comply with policies G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and policies LP47 and LP51 of the Hackney Local Plan (LP33) (2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;Due to the excessive scale of the proposed rear extension, particularly in regard to height and depth, the proposed development would result in a signifant and detrimental imapct on the amenities enjoyed by both nos 73 and 77 Kynaston Road, particularly in regard to loss of outlook, increased sense of enclosure and loss of daylight/sunlight. The proposed development is therefore considered unacceptable in regard to amenity impact and fails to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan (LP33) and the stipulations of the Council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed basement would result in an unacceptable standard of living accommodation for the occupiers through poor layout and unacceptable floor-to-ceiling height giving rise to low levels of daylight/sunlight and outlook serving the proposed room. Further, the proposal would result in an unacceptable loss of garden space to the detriment of the occupier&#x27;s living conditions. The proposal fails to comply with policies D3, D4, and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1, LP2, and LP17 of the Hackney Local Plan (LP33), and the stipulations of the council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009). &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
