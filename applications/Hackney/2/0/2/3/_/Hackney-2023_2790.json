    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension to the two storey rear addition, by virtue of its siting, scale, form and mass, would constitute an incongruous form of development that is not subordinate to the host building, would be uncharacteristic of the surrounding area and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D4 (Delivering good design) and of the London Plan 2021, policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and of the Hackney Local Plan 2020 and the recommendations of the Supplementary Planning Document: Residential Extensions and Alterations 2009."
