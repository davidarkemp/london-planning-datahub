The proposed development is therefore, considered unacceptable and fails to comply with policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 and LP3 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020), and the stipulations of the council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"
