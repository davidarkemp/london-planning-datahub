    "&lt;p&gt;By reason of its excessive height and depth, the proposed ground-floor extension would have a harmful impact on the amenities enjoyed by both neighbouring properties of nos 16 and 20 Walford Road in regard to loss of outlook, sense of enclosure, and loss of daylight/sunlight. In addition, the overall bulk of the proposed upward extension would mean that this element of the proposal would fail to comply with the 45-degree rule when measured from the nearest neighbouring habitable window along the rear elevation of no. 16 Walford Road, resulting in a further impact in relation to a sense of enclosure and loss of daylight/sunlight at upper floor levels. The proposed development is therefore unacceptable in regard to amenity impact and fails to comply with policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan LP33 (2020), and the stipulations of the Council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009). &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed upward extension above the existing outrigger feature would disrupt the sense of symmetry between the application site and the neighbouring property of no. 16 Walford Road when viewed from the rear, and would appear as an overly prominent feature when viewed from neighbouring sites. The extension would appear as an incongruous feature within the terrace of which the application site forms a part and would appear as a disproportionate addition to the host property. The upward extension is therefore unacceptable and fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan LP33 (2020), and the stipulations of the council&#x27;s Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;By reason of its inappropriate design, particularly in regard to depth and height, the proposed ground-floor extension would appear as an incongruous and overbearing addition to the host property that would fail to complement the original design of the host property or the character of the surrounding area. The proposed ground-floor extension is considered unacceptable and fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies LP1 and LP2 of the Hackney Local Plan LP33 (2020), and the stipulations of the council&#x27;s&amp;nbsp; Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD (2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
