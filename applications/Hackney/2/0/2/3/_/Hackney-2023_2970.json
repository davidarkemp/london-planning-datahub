    "The proposed step free access ramp, new side gate, security cameras, lighting, electrical wiring, by reason of their scale, massing, detailed design, position and location are considered to result in an obtrusive and incongruous addition that would result in unacceptable harm to the special historic interest of the listed building and the character and appearance of the host building and the Graham Road and Mapledene Conservation Area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies HC1 (Heritage, Conservation, and Growth) and D3 (Optimising Site Capacity through the Design-led Approach) of the London Plan 2021 and policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character), and LP3 (Designated Heritage Assets) of the Hackney Local Plan 2033."
