    "Non CHP boilersAny non-CHP space and hot water fossil fuel (or equivalent hydrocarbon based fuel) boilers must achieve dry NOx emission levels equivalent to or less than 30 mg/kWh.REASON: To protect air quality and people&#39;s health by ensuring that the production of air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, are kept to a minimum during the course of building works and during the lifetime of the development. To contribute towards the maintenance or to prevent further exceedances of National Air Quality Objectives.",
    "Flood Resilience and ResistanceWithin three months of the date of this planning permission, a report (including intrusive investigation/trial pit and monitoring where necessary) demonstrating that the basement development will not increase the potential for groundwater flooding to itself or to the surrounding area during and post construction shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. Where groundwater is identified as a potential risk, details of appropriate controls including flood resilience and/or resistance measures shall be submitted to the LPA for approval and the approved measures incorporated before the basement is occupied. The basement shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans in line with BS 8102:2009 code of practice for &#34;protection of below ground structures against water from the ground&#34;.REASON: To protect future users against the risks of groundwater flooding in this critical drainage area with a high risk of surface water flooding.",
    "Sustainable Urban DrainageWithin three months of the date of this planning permission, a detailed specification and a drainage layout of at least one suitable sustainable drainage systems (i.e. water butt, raingarden, bioretention planter box, living roof (substrate depth of 80-150mm excluding the vegetative mat), permeable paving, etc.) shall be submitted to, and approved by the LPA, in consultation with the LLFA. If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume.REASON: In the interests of prevention of exacerbation of surface water flood risk to adjoining land.",
    "Demolition and Construction Management PlanNo development shall take place until a Construction Logistics and Traffic Management Plan (CLTMP) has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in conjunction with Transport for London and the Council&#39;s Traffic and Transport Team. The CLTMP shall include a full construction traffic impact assessment, details of the construction traffic route and a construction traffic management plan to include details of the following:(a) loading and unloading of plant and materials;(b) storage of plant and materials;(c) programme of works (including measures for traffic management); and(d) provision of boundary hoarding behind any visibility zones.The construction should thereafter take place in accordance with the measures identified within the approved documents.REASON: In order to ensure that the development does not prejudice highway safety and to ensure the proper management of construction traffic in the interests of highways safety and the amenity of the area.",
