    "The proposed development by reason of its design, materiality, scale and positioning, would result in an incompatible and obtrusive development which would harm the special character and appearance of the conservation area, the host building and wider streetscape in this prominent location. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) and LP3 (Designated heritage assets) of Hackney Local Plan 2033 (2020), policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design led approach) and HC1 (Heritage conservation and growth) of The London Plan (2021) and the Mare St Conservation Area Appraisal. ",
    "The proposal, which would provide only two one-bedroom one-person dwellings, would result in an inappropriate mix of dwellings which would fail to provide accommodation suitable for the needs of families and would not meet housing need in the borough. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy H10 (Housing size mix) of the London Plan (2021), and policy LP14 (Dwelling size mix) of the London Plan (2021). ",
    "The proposed accommodation would result in a cramped form of over development of the site that would provide substandard living conditions for future occupiers by virtue of inadequate and badly arranged internal living space, contrary to policy LP17 (Housing design) of Local Plan 2033 (2020); policies D6 (Housing quality and standards) and D7 (Inclusive housing) of the London Plan (2021); the GLA&#x27;s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016); and to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).
