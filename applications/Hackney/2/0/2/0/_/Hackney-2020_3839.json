Due consideration should be taken in particular to the\r\nmeans of escape, safe evacuation for disabled persons and access for the fire\r\nbrigade appliances. This is to ensure that appropriate fire safety measures are in\r\nplace for people in and around the building and access for the fire brigade. Should\r\nany subsequent changes be required to the approved fire strategy to ensure\r\ncompliance, a revised fire strategy would need to be submitted and approved by\r\nthe Local Planning Authority.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: To ensure the development adequately addresses fire safety&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Within four weeks of planning permission being issued by the Local Planning\r\nAuthority, the Owner is required to submit to the GLA accurate and verified\r\nestimates of the ‘be seen’ energy performance indicators, as outlined in Chapter 3\r\n‘Planning stage’ of the GLA ‘Be seen’ energy monitoring guidance document, for\r\nthe consented development. This should be submitted to the GLA&#x27;s monitoring\r\nportal in accordance with the ‘Be seen’ energy monitoring guidance.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Once the as-built design has been completed (upon commencement of RIBA\r\nStage 6) and prior to the building(s) being occupied (or handed over to a new legal\r\nowner, if applicable), the legal Owner is required to provide updated accurate and\r\nverified estimates of the ‘be seen’ energy performance indicators for each\r\nreportable unit of the development, as per the methodology outlined in Chapter 4\r\n‘As-built stage’ of the GLA ‘Be seen’ energy monitoring guidance. All data and\r\nsupporting evidence should be uploaded to the GLA’s monitoring portal. The owner\r\nshould also confirm that suitable monitoring devices have been installed and\r\nmaintained for the monitoring of the in-use energy performance indicators, as\r\noutlined in Chapter 5 ‘In-use stage’ of the GLA ‘Be seen’ energy monitoring\r\nguidance document.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. Upon completion of the first year of occupation following the end of the defects\r\nliability period (DLP) and for the following four years, the legal Owner is required to\r\nprovide accurate and verified annual in-use energy performance data for all\r\nrelevant indicators under each reportable unit of the development as per the\r\nmethodology outlined in Chapter 5 ‘In-use stage’ of the GLA ‘Be seen’ energy&amp;nbsp; monitoring guidance document. All data and supporting evidence should be\r\nuploaded to the GLA’s monitoring portal. This condition will be satisfied after the\r\nlegal Owner has reported on all relevant indicators included in Chapter 5 ‘In-use\r\nstage’ of the GLA ‘Be Seen’ energy monitoring guidance document for at least five\r\nyears.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event that the in-use evidence submitted shows that the as-built\r\nperformance estimates have not been or are not being met, the legal Owner\r\nshould use reasonable endeavours to investigate and identify the causes of\r\nunderperformance and the potential mitigation measures and set these out in the\r\nrelevant comment box of the ‘be seen’ spreadsheet. Where measures are\r\nidentified, which it would be reasonably practicable to implement, an action plan\r\ncomprising such measures should be prepared and agreed with the Local Planning\r\nAuthority and be implemented by the legal Owner as soon as reasonably\r\npracticable.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REASON: In order to ensure that actual operational energy performance is\r\nminimised and demonstrate compliance with the ‘be seen’ post-construction\r\nmonitoring requirement of Policy SI 2 of the London Plan&lt;/p&gt;",
