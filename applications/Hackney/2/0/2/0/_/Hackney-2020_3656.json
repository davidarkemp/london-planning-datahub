As such, it would be contrary to policies 7.4 (Local Character) and 7.6 (Architecture) of the London Plan (2016), policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth) and D4 (Delivering good design) of the emerging Draft New London Plan (Intend to Publish) (2019), policy LP1 of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained with the Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary Planning Document.&lt;/p&gt;",
