As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth) and D6 (Housing quality and standards) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP2 (Development and amenity) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
    "&lt;p&gt;The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its height, depth, massing, detailed design and siting is considered to result in an incongruous addition that would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the subject property, the terrace it is located within and the surrounding area. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies D1 (London’s form, character and capacity for growth) and D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) of the London Plan (2021), policy LP1 (Design Quality and Local Character) of the Hackney Local Plan (2020) and the guidance contained within Hackney Residential Extensions and Alterations SPD 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
