If soakaways i.e. plastic modules and soakaway rings are used, an infiltration test must be carried out to ensure that the capacity of the soil is suitable for infiltration. It must be demonstrated that there will be no increase in surface water flow being discharged offsite and an overall reduction in peak flow rate and volume for all return periods up to the 1 in 100 year storm events plus an allowance for climate change.REASON: To address adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change; provide sustainable urban drainage and manage surface water run-off in a critical drainage area as close to source as possible; enhance biodiversity values; and improve the appearance and resilience of the development."
