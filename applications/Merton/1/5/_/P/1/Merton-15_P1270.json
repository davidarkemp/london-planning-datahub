    "Reason : 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by: Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome. As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application. In this instance: The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan  It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions. The applicant is encouraged to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The dwelling by reason of its design, massing, orientation and proximity to site boundaries would result in an incongruous addition to the terrace failing to relate positively to the rythm and massing of surrounding buildfings and urban layout, failing to respect the form of the existing building or complement the character of the area, and resulting in a loss of privacy to the detriment of the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.The proposals would be contrary to policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM.D2 and DM.D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
