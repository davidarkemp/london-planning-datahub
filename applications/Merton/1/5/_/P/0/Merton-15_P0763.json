    "Reason : 1 - The proposed building, by reason of design, massing and position would be unduly prominent and visually dominant, and would represent an unsympathetic feature that would be harmful to the appearance of adjoining buildings and the street scene generally contrary to policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan [2014], policy CS 14 of the adopted Core Strategy [2011] and policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would fail to provide an adequate standard of residential accommodation due to the inadequate provision of external amenity space that is below adopted minimum standards and as a result the proposal would be contrary to policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan [2014] and the Mayor of London SPG on Housing.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - NOTE TO APPLICANT: The applicant is advised that in accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the National Planning Policy Framework, The London Borough of Merton takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. The London Borough of Merton works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service; where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome and as appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.
