    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions and alterations would by reason of size, position and design, be an unsympathetic addition to the existing building being unduly dominant, detracting from the appearance of the host building, and would be out of character with and harmful to the character and appearance of the locality and contrary to policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan and policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed flats, by reason of design would result in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation for one bedroom/two person-bedspace units arising from a failure to meet minimum floorspace standards coupled with significant parts of the living spaces having restricted headroom failing to meet adopted standards. The proposal would contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2015), policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF (2011), policy DMD3 of the Sites and Policy Plan (2014) and The Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2012).",
    "Reason : 3 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by: Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service.  Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome. As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application. In this instance: The applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\nThe application was considered to be contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF. It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions. The applicant is encouraged to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
