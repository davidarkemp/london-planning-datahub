    "Reason : 2 - The proposed houses by reason of their excessive height, bulk, and massing, would not relate positively and appropriately to the siting, rhythm, scale, density, proportions, height, materials and massing of surrounding buildings, and would have a detrirmental impact on the Ridgway Place street scene, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
