    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its size, siting, height and design is considered an unneighbourly form of development which would be overly large, visually intrusive, and harmful to the amenity of neighbours in terms of overlooking and overshadowing, appearing unduly dominant and out of context and character with the existing Borough Road/Lewis Road/Western Road urban landscape and would be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policies CS13 & CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Standard 3.1.1 of the London Housing SPG 2012.",
    "Reason : 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any readily apparent solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwelling would fail to provide an acceptable standard of vehicular and pedestrian access to the detriment of the safety of future occupiers contrary to Policy DM D2 and DM T2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and CS 20 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would fail to contribute to meeting affordable housing targets and in the absence of a legal undertaking securing a financial contribution towards the delivery of affordable housing off-site would be contrary to policy CS8 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011)."
