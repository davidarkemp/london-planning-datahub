    "Reason : 1 - \r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any apparent solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor extension by reason of its size, height, design, and massing represents an overly large, unduly dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would be harmful to the visual amenities of neighbours and result in unacceptable loss of light to adjoining occupiers, contrary to policies 7.4 of the London Plan 2011, LBM Core Strategy Policy CS14 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (2014).
