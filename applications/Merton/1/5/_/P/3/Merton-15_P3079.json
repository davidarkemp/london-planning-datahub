    "Reason : 1 - The proposed additional third and fourth floor by virtue of its bulk, form, scale,\r\nheight and design would constitute an obtrusive and incongruous form of\r\ndevelopment that would detract from the appearance of the original building\r\nand be out of keeping with, and detrimental to, the visual amenity and\r\ncharacter of the London Road streetscene, and would be harmful to the\r\namenity of neighbours in terms of loss of daylight and sunlight and visual\r\nintrusion. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan policies\r\n7.4 and 7.6, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy policy CS14 and Merton\r\nSPP policies DMD2 and DMD3",
    "Reason : 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by: Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome. As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application. In this instance: The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. The applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application. The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
