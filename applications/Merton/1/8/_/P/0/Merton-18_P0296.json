  "description": "ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - \n\nNote to Applicant\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\nIn this instance:\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its height, depth, scale and siting, would be an overly dominant and un-neighbourly form of development resulting in undue sense of enclosure and exacerbate the outlook to the detriment of the amenities of the neighbouring property, contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
