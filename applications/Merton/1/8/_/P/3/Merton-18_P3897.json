    "Reason : 1 - The proposed end of terrace building, by reason of its bulk, massing and design, would constitute an unduly dominant and incongruous addition to the existing terrace, harmful to the visual amenities of the Grove Road streetscene and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the London Plan (2016) policies 7.4 and 7.6, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) policy CS 14 and Merton's Site and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its size would result in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal would be contrary to the London Plan (2016) policy 3.5,  Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) policy CS 14 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards (nationally described space standards) (2015).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development fails to demonstrate that adequate secure cycle storage facilities, and separate and conveniently accessible commercial and domestic refuse facilities can be provided on site, thereby failing to promote more sustainable modes of transport and deliver suitable refuse arrangements. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policy 6.9, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) CS18 and CS20 and Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM T1.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so at to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan 2016 Policy 5.2 and 5.15 and Policy CS 15 of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions, other than to submit a new application, to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
