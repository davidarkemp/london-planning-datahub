    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its height, length, scale and siting, would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development to the detriment of neighbouring amenity in terms of loss of light, overshadowing, loss of outlook, visual intrusion and an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
