    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding by reason of its design, size, use and siting is considered an unneighbourly form of development which would be visually intrusive, overly dominant and harmful to the amenity of neighbours and is unsympathetic to the design, materials, scale, bulk and proportions of the surrounding buildings to the detriment of the character of the Camborne Road streetscene, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies CS 13 & CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
