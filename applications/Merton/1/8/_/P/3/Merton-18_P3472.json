  "description": "CONSTRUCTION OF PART SINGLE STOREY, PART TWO STOREY REAR AND SIDE EXTENSION",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, bulk and design would be unduly prominent and intrusive exacerbating the prominence of an incongruous addition which would be detrimental to the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers and the character of the host dwelling when seen from Belgrave Walk to the rear. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 Policies 7.4 & 7.6, Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - Note to Applicant\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\nIn this instance:\n\"\tThe application was considered to be contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be solutions to resolve this conflict. \n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice before making any resubmission.\n"
