    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling, by reason of its siting, would be an incongruous form of development failing to respond positively and appropriately to surrounding buildings or the existing pattern of development locally. The proposals would be contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning strategy (2011) and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the design and layout of the accommodation including proximity of bedroom windows to basement walls will fail to provide an adequate standard of living accommodation with poor levels of outlook and natural light provided for future occupants contrary to policies DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan and CS14 of the Core Strategy. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposals, by reason of the size, split level design, and proximity of outdoor amenity space to neighbouring first floor windows, would suffer from overlooking and a lack of privacy, and not be configured into a single usable space, thereby failing to provide a satisfactory external environment to meet the needs of prospective occupants, contrary to policy DMD2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that they would adopt appropriate resilient design techniques and appropriate flood mitigation measures in relation to the residential basement. The proposal therefore fails to meet the objectives of policies DM F1 and DM F2 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy 5.13 of the London Plan (2015).",
    "Reason : 5 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance: \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
