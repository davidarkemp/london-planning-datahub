    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its siting, scale and design, would result in an unneighbourly and overly dominant extension to the detriment of neighbouring amenity resulting in of loss of outlook and visual intrusion and would further compound poor levels of existing sunlight and daylight contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011, and Policy DMD2 of Sites & Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its design & layout would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal floorspace standards and external private amenity space standards to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its siting and design would suffer from a poor and restricted outlook and access to natural light as in order to maintain privacy to neighbouring properties, thereby giving rise to a poor and unsatisfactory environment for future occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS.14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed refuse storage as shown on the plans would provide an inadequate space to accommodate the required refuse standards and would therefore fail to meet policy 5.17 of the London Plan 2016 and policy CS 17 of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.
