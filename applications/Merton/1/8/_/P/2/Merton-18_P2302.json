  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of residential accommodation due to the single bedroom of the proposed house not being a functional shape or fit for purpose, whilst the proposed amenity space would not be a single usable regular shape contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and policy 3.5 of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would result in one additional residential unit with no off-street parking and the loss of two off-street parking spaces for the existing house. The site is located in a controlled parking zone and there is no legal agreement in place for both the existing and proposed units to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS.20 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (July 2011), and policy DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
