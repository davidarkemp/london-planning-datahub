  "description": "ERECTION OF A TWO STOREY DETATCHED DWELLINGHOUSE",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling, by reason of its design, size and siting would be incongruous and visually intrusive, failing to respond positively and appropriately to surrounding buildings or the existing pattern of development locally, where spaces to the rear of dwellings at junctions and street corners contribute to the suburban character of the area. The proposals would be contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning strategy (2011) and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its size, siting and proximity to boundaries, and boundary treatments would result in an overly dominant, visually intrusive and un-neighbourly form of development that would harm the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, and would result in a garden that would suffer from overlooking and be awkwardly configured detracting from its effective utility for future occupants. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites & Policy Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposals fail to demonstrate that they would achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and water usage so as to deliver policy complaint sustainable construction. The proposals therefore fail to meet the objectives of policy CS15 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies 5.2 and 5.15 of the London Plan (2015).\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of adequate pedestrian visibility splays to the off-street parking, the proposal would consolidate the risk of pedestrian and vehicular collisions when entering and exiting the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS20 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and DM T5 of the Merton Site and Policies Plan (2014).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and planning officers could not readily identify amendments that would address these conflicts. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
