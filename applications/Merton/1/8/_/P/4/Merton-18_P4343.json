LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner. In this instance the application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\n",
    "Condition : 19 - With regard to surface water drainage, Thames Water would advise that if the developer follows the sequential approach to the disposal of surface water we would have no objection. Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required. Should you require further information please refer to our website.  https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__developers.thameswater.co.uk_Developing-2Da-2Dlarge-2Dsite_Apply-2Dand-2Dpay-2Dfor-2Dservices_Wastewater-2Dservices&d=DwIFAw&c=HmJinpA0me9MkKQ19xEDwK7irBsCvGfF6AWwfMZqono&r=HVy2BaAHoy75Et42R7vHQVgBJr4jmCMnquJWjP-jOUE&m=5v6Bw-VkXe6eFQRbg9cGRWhfjWIFHrRu8rJikrRZ0Yw&s=UsGv1q7WokyCuRTp94IEu-Gy0Rd-dpqE2VgaiHc6Pso&e",
    "Condition : 20 - The Applicant should incorporate within their proposal, protection to the property by installing a positive pumped device (or equivalent reflecting technological advances) to avoid the risk of backflow at a later date, on the assumption that the sewerage network may surcharge to ground level during storm conditions.  Fitting only a non-return valve could result in flooding to the property should there be prolonged surcharge in the public sewer.  If as part of the basement development there is a proposal to discharge ground water to the public network, this would require a Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water. Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. We would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures he will undertake to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 02035779483 or by emailing wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk. Application forms should be completed on line via www.thameswater.co.uk/wastewaterquality",
    "Condition : 21 - Thames Water will aim to provide customers with a minimum pressure of 10m head (approx 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where it leaves Thames Waters pipes. The developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of the proposed development."
