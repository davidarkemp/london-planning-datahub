    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the number of bedrooms and associated occupancy, would be likely to give rise to an intensification of the use of the site, which in the absence of details pertaining to the day to day management of the property would have the potential to be harmful to the residential character and amenities of neighbouring occupiers by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the proposed use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies DMD2 and DMH5 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the proposed location of the refuse storage and proposed collection arrangements and loss of on-site trees, would result in material harm to the character of the area and neighbouring amenity, as a result of overspill rubbish and the potential for blocking of the  existing vehicular access to Nos.10a-10c Cedars Avenue. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016, Policies CS14 and CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DMD2, DMD3 and DM H5 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to Policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016, Policies CS18 and CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM T1 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n"
