    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.\n\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: 00_0000, 00_1200, 02_2200, 04_2200.",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 5 - The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until the cycle parking shown on the plans hereby approved has been provided and made available for use. These facilities shall be retained for the occupants of and visitors to the development at all times.",
    "Condition : 6 - Prior to the commencement of the development hereby permitted, a Construction Logistics Plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The approved measures shall be implemented prior to the first occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be so maintained for the duration of the use, unless the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority is first obtained to any variation.",
    "Condition : 7 - The mitigation measures set out in the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal by RPS, dated January 2019 shall be implemented prior to the commencement of works and maintained throughout works.\n\nReason: To ensure the protection of the integrity of the natural environment around the site and to comply with Sites and Policies Policy DMO1 and DMO2 and Core Strategy Policy 13.",
    "Condition : 8 - The finished ground floor level must be set no lower than 9.42 metres above Ordnance Datum (mAOD).\n\nReason: To reduce the risk of surface and foul water flooding to the proposed development and future users, and ensure surface water and foul flood risk does not increase offsite in accordance with Merton's policies CS16, DMF2 and the London Plan policy 5.13.",
    "Condition : 9 - No development approved by this permission shall be commenced until a detailed scheme for the provision of surface and foul water drainage has been implemented in accordance with details that have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority and in consultation with Thames Water. The drainage scheme will dispose of surface water by means of a sustainable drainage system (SuDS) at the restricted rate of no more than 1l/s in accordance with drainage hierarchy contained within the London Plan Policy (5.12, 5.13 and SPG) and the advice contained within the National SuDS Standards. \n\nReason: To reduce the risk of surface and foul water flooding to the proposed development and future users, and ensure surface water and foul flood risk does not increase offsite in accordance with Merton's policies CS16, DMF2 and the London Plan policy 5.13.\n",
    "Condition : 10 - Prior to the commencement of development, the detailed design and specification for the permeable paving and surface water attenuation shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The design shall be carried out as approved, retained and maintained in perpetuity thereafter.\n\nReason: To reduce the risk of surface and foul water flooding to the proposed development and future users, and ensure surface water and foul flood risk does not increase offsite in accordance with Merton's policies CS16, DMF2 and the London Plan policy 5.13.\n",
    "Condition : 11 - No surface water runoff should discharge onto the public highway including the public footway or highway. When it is proposed to connect to a public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.   Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).",
    "Condition : 12 - No waste material, including concrete, mortar, grout, plaster, fats, oils and chemicals shall be washed down on the highway or disposed of into the highway drainage system.",
    "Condition : 13 - If the drain on the subject site becomes blocked, it is the responsibility of the applicant to unblock it promptly.",
    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE\nDemolition of buildings should avoid the bird nesting and bat roosting season. This avoids disturbing birds and bats during a critical period and will assist in preventing possible contravention of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which seeks to protect nesting birds/bats and their nests/roosts. Buildings should also be inspected for bird nests and bat roosts prior to demolition. All species of bat in Britain and their roosts are afforded special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside act 1981.  If bats are found, Natural England should be contacted for advice (tel: 020 7831 6922).\n"
