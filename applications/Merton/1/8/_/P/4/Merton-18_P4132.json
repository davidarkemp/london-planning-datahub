The approved facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use prior to the first occupation of the development and thereafter retained for use at all times.",
    "Condition : 10 - No part of the development hereby approved shall be occupied until evidence has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority confirming that the development has achieved CO2 reductions of not less than a 19% improvement on Part L regulations 2013, and internal water consumption rates of no greater than 105 litres per person per day. \r\n\r\nReason:\r\nTo ensure that the development achieves a high standard of sustainability and makes efficient use of resources and to comply with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policy 5.2 of the London Plan 2015 and Policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.\r\n",
    "Condition : 11 - No development approved by this permission shall be commenced until a detailed scheme for the provision of surface and foul water drainage has been implemented in accordance with details that have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The drainage scheme will dispose of surface water by means of a sustainable drainage system (SuDS) at the agreed runoff rate (no more than 2l/s), in accordance with drainage hierarchy contained within the London Plan Policy (5.12, 5.13 and SPG) and the advice contained within the National SuDS Standards. \r\n\r\nReason: To reduce the risk of surface and foul water flooding to the proposed development and future users, and ensure surface water and foul flood risk does not increase offsite in accordance with Merton's policies CS16, DMF2 and the London Plan policy 5.13.\r\n",
    "Condition : 12 - Prior to the commencement of development, the applicant shall submit a detailed construction method statement (CMS) produced by the respective contractor/s responsible for building the approved works, to the approval of the Local Planning Authority. The construction method statement shall also detail how drainage and any groundwater will be managed during and post construction, based on site specific ground investigation and groundwater monitoring results via a standpipe.\r\n\r\nReason: To reduce the risk of surface and foul water flooding to the proposed development and future users, and ensure surface water and foul flood risk does not increase offsite in accordance with Merton's policies CS16, DMF2 and the London Plan policy 5.13.\r\n",
    "Condition : 13 - No development approved by this permission shall be commenced until a final scheme to reduce the potential impact of groundwater ingress both to and from the proposed development, has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall address the risks both during and post construction. Should dewatering be required during construction, the detailed Construction Method Statement will need to address the measures to minimise silt dispersal and pollutants detail where waters will be discharged to. This shall be informed by site specific ground investigation including groundwater monitoring results.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the risk of groundwater ingress to and from the development is managed appropriately and to reduce the risk of flooding in compliance with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy 5.13 of the London Plan 2011, policy CS16 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies, DM D2 and DM F2 of Merton's Sites and Polices Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Condition : 14 - Prior to the commencement of development, the detailed design and specification for the permeable paving and green roofs shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The design shall be carried out as approved, retained and maintained in perpetuity thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: To reduce the risk of surface and foul water flooding to the proposed development and future users, and ensure surface water and foul flood risk does not increase offsite in accordance with Merton's policies CS16, DMF2 and the London Plan policy 5.13.\r\n",
    "Condition : 15 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building. Further information is available at the following link: \r\nhttp://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/buildingpolicyandlegislation/current legislation/partywallact\r\n",
    "Condition : 16 - INFORMATIVE: No surface water runoff should discharge onto the public highway including the public footway or highway. When it is proposed to connect to a public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.   Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer or divert or build over a sewer, the prior written approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).\r\n\r\nNo waste material, including concrete, mortar, grout, plaster, fats, oils and chemicals shall be washed down on the highway or disposed of into the highway drainage system.\r\n",

    "Condition : 18 - INFORMATIVE:  Thames Water will aim to provide customers with a minimum pressure of 10m head (approx 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where it leaves Thames Waters pipes. The developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of the proposed development.",
    "Condition : 19 - INFORMATIVE:  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required. Should you require further information please refer to their website  https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__developers.thameswater.co.uk_Developing-2Da-2Dlarge-2Dsite_Apply-2Dand-2Dpay-2Dfor-2Dservices_Wastewater-2Dservices&d=DwIFAw&c=HmJinpA0me9MkKQ19xEDwK7irBsCvGfF6AWwfMZqono&r=HVy2BaAHoy75Et42R7vHQVgBJr4jmCMnquJWjP-jOUE&m=z5ruUnEuYGIMo-r6qDhPLAc-1ufnPDjl6Q8yGbLofBA&s=2naDqgHu9QnPbgNRAOTE3NMcsB5z3tSrrCOhAffJR40&e",
    "Condition : 20 - INFORMATIVE: Thames Water requests that the Applicant should incorporate within their proposal, protection to the property by installing a positive pumped device (or equivalent reflecting technological advances) to avoid the risk of backflow at a later date, on the assumption that the sewerage network may surcharge to ground level during storm conditions.  Fitting only a non-return valve could result in flooding to the property should there be prolonged surcharge in the public sewer.  If as part of the basement development there is a proposal to discharge ground water to the public network, this would require a Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water. Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. We would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures he will undertake to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 02035779483 or by emailing wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk. Application forms should be completed on line via www.thameswater.co.uk/wastewaterquality "
