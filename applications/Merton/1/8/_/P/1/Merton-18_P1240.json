    "Reason : 1 - The proposed erection of a two storey dwelling in conjunction with the retention and enlargement of the existing side extension would result in the loss of a significant visual break within the streetscene that would be to the detriment of visual amenity and the open suburban nature of the Monkleigh Road streetscene, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, DM D2 & DM D3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two-storey house by reason of its design and siting would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal floorspace standards to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
