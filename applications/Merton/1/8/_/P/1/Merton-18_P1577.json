The proposals would be contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2015), policy CS.14 (b)(vi) of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM.D2 (v) of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)\"",
    "Reason : 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\nOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\nWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\nAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\nThe application was considered at the Planning Applications Committee at which the applicant had the opportunity to promote the application..\r\nThe Planning Applications Committee considered the application did not comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted. \r\nThe applicant is encouraged to contact the planning case officer (tony.smith@merton.gov.uk) in advance of making a further application.
