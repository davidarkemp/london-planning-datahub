    "Reason : 2 - The proposal involving the construction of an end-of-terrace house and conversion of the existing property to flats would fail to provide a suitable standard of accommodation for future occupiers arising from the absence of external amenity space for the upper flat and inadequate garden space for the new house, contrary to policy HS.1 of the Unitary Development Plan (October 2003) and the Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance on Residential Extensions, Alterations and Conversions (November 2001)."
