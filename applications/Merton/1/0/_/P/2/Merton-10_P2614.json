    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its design, siting, height, bulk and massing, would result in an unduly prominent and unneighbourly form of development, which would:\r\na) fail to respond to, or reinforce the locally distinctive pattern of development \r\nb) result in the loss of garden land with implications for biodiversity, trees and wildlife habitats\r\nc) result in a loss of amenity for nearby properties and their rear gardens in terms of loss of privacy and visual intrusion, including light pollution;\r\ncontrary to policies BE.15, BE.16, BE.22, NE.10, NE.12 and P.3 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (2003) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance Notes: New Residential Development (1999).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on educational facilities, and on local public open space and children's play spaces. In the absence of a planning undertaking to provide a financial contribution toward education provision, the upgrade of local public open space and children's play space and the costs of monitoring the S106 obligations the proposal would fail to mitigate the impacts of the proposals and would be contrary to policies C.13, L.8 & L.9 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (October 2003) and the Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance: Planning Obligations (2006)."
