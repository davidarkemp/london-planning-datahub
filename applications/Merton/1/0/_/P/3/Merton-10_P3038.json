    "Reason : 1 - The applicant's submitted elevations fail to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council that the proposed elevation fronting Nursery Road would respond to and reinforce the design and appearance or respect the proportions of the adjoining building, 20 Nursery Road, with the potential to give rise to a discordant and unattractive overall elevation to the terrace, of which the new dwelling would form a part, to the detriment of visual amenity and would be contrary to policies BE.16 and BE.22 of the Merton Unitary Development Plan (2003).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on education facilities in the area and children's playspace. In the absence of a legal undertaking securing a financial contribution to mitigate for the impact of the proposals in these respects the proposal would be contrary to policies C13 and L.9 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (2003) and Supplementary Planning Guidance: Planning Obligations (2006)..\r\n"
