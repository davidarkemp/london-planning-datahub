    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of a cramped internal layout, poor outlook and lack of external amenity space, would result in an unsatisfactory environment and fail to provide an adequate standard of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policy HS.1 & BE.15 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan 2003 and the Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance \"Residential Extensions, Alterations and Conversions.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would result in the loss of employment floorspace for which the applicant has failed to demonstrate a lack of demand through evidence of full and proper marketing contrary and would undermine the Council's objectives to safeguard employment land and floorspace for jobs, contrary to policies E.6 (Loss of Employment Land Outside the Designated Industrial Areas) and ST.14 (Employment Land) of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan 2003.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on education facilities in the area and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a financial contribution towards education facilities locally, the proposal would be contrary to policies C.13 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (2003) and Supplementary Planning Guidance: Planning Obligations (2006)."
