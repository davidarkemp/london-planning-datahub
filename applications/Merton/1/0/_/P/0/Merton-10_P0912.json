    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on educational facilities in the area. In the absence of a legal agreement securing a financial contribution toward education provision locally the proposals would fail to offset their impact within the area, and would be contrary to policies ST.36 and C.13 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (October 2003) and Supplementary Planning Guidance: Planning Obligations (2006)."
