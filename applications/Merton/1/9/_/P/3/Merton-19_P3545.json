    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and width and number of units would result in an overdevelopment of the site contrary to Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Polices Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would provide an inadequate level of off -street parking which would likely result in an unnacceptable level of oversplill parking on surrounding residential streets. The development would also not facilitate safe pedestrian access from Elm Grove whilst there is a poor access arrangement provided within the site contrary to policies 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, CS.18 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and DM T2, DM T3 & DM T5 of the Sites and Polices Plan 2014."
