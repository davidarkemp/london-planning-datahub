    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hip to gable and rear roof dormer extension, by reason of its siting, size, bulk and massing would represent an overbearing and harmful form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and unbalance the appearance of the terrace row of properties; it would also fail to preserve or enhance the Commonside West streetscene or Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016(, Policies DMD2, DMD3 and DMD4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy CS14 of the Merton's Core Strategy (2011). ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
