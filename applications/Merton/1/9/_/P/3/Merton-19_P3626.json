    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, design and materials, the two-storey extension is considered to cause material harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, terrace, and surrounding area, and harm the living conditions of neighbouring occupants by way of sense of enclosure and overbearing form. The zinc canopy to the front elevation is also considered visually harmful due to the use of materials that are uncharacteristic on a dwelling within the subject terrace and wider street scene.  The proposals are therefore contrary to the principles of the London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy Policy CS14, and Sites and Policies Plan DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
