    "Reason : 1 - The proposed signage, by reason of its size, siting and illumination would be would be harmful to the visual amenities of the street scene and would harm the amenities of the surrounding residential properties. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Policy DM D5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan",
    "Reason : 2 - Informative:\r\nThe applicant is advised that express consent under the Advertisement Regulations was refused for the erection of a non-illuminated advertising hoarding (reference 01/P0740) and the appeal was subsequently dismissed. The existing advertisement hoarding is therefore unauthorised and should be removed.\r\nThe breach of planning control has been referred to the Council's  Planning enforcement action for any action it deems appropriate.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
