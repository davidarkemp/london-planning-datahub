  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Notwithstanding metropolitan planning objective of optimising housing potential, as set out in policy 3.4 of the London Plan, the proposals by reason of their massing and bulk, would result in an overdevelopment of the site that would appear cramped, and would fail to relate positively and appropriately to the Rural Way streetscene to the detriment of the visual amenities of the area.  The proposals would be contrary to policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015), policy CS.14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011), and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered by the Council's Planning Applications Committee not to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
