    "Condition : 1 - The operations would consist of the enlargement of a dwelling house within the meaning of Class B of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class B. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 2 - The operations would consist of any other alteration to the roof of the dwelling house within the meaning of Class C of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class C. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Reason : 1 - The edge of the proposed roof extension closest to the eaves of the original roof is not less than 0.2 metres from the eaves, measured along the roof slope from the outside edge of the eaves; thereby breaching the threshold of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2(b) (i)(bb). Planning permission is therefore required.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant is advised that any future submission should include drawings that are consistent with each other in relation to the dimensions of the proposed roof extension."
