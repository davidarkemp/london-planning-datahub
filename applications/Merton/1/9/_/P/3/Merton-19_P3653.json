    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and submitted revised details \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of the number of bedrooms, and associated potential occupancy, would result in an unneighbourly overdevelopment and over intensification of the site, resulting in a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers by reason of substandard floor space for room 1 and poor light and outlook in room 2, and would likely be harmful to the residential character and amenities of the surrounding area by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM H5 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016 and Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy 2011."
