    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension at 6m in depth and 3.4m in height would result in a significant sense of enclosure, loss of daylight and sunlight to ground floor rooms and immediate rear garden space and would be considered overbearing for the occupiers at 6 and 10 Kenley Road. On this basis the proposal is considered not to be acceptable in terms of neighbouring amenity and would fail to comply with the criteria as stated in Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r\n\r\nThe proposal is therefore non-compliant with the criteria set out under Class A in the GDPO 2015 (as amended).
