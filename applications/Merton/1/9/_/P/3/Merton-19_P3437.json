    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear roof extension  would, by virtue of it's design and appearance would fail to complement the character of the host dwelling contrary to policy CS14 (Design) of the Adopted Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 (Design Considerations in all Developments) and DM D3 (Alterations and Extension to Existing Buildings) of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The submitted plans fail to demonstrate how the proposed accommodation within the roofspace would be accessed and the application contains a conflicting site location plan. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with the requirements of policy DM D2 (Design Considerations in all Developments) of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
