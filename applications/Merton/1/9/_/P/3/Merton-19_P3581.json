    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension by reason of design, massing, siting and height would fail to achieve high quality design, respect space between buildings, relate positively and appropriately to the Ryfold Road street scene, by creating a bulky and overly dominant addition to the building/site, harming the spaciousness in the streetscape, contrary to policies DM D2 Design Considerations in all developments and DM D3 Alterations and extensions to existing buildings of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), and CS14 - Design of Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of poor building design/layout and inappropriate access arrangement would fail to achieve high quality design, safe, secure and to take account of crime prevention, contrary to policies DM D2 Design Considerations in all developments and DM D3 Alterations and extensions to existing buildings of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), and CS14 - Design of Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed female access and external staircase by reason of design, height and siting would be an un-neighbourly form of development, result in noise and light disturbance which would be detrimental to the residential amenities of 24 Ryfold Road, contrary to policies DM D2 (Design Considerations in all developments) and DM EP2 (Reducing and mitigating noise) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS14 - Design of Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not create inconvenience and obstruction to all road users (including emergency services) and not harm road safety, contrary to policies DM D2 (Design Considerations in all developments), DM T2 Transport impacts of development, DM T3 Car parking and servicing standards and DM T5 Access to the Road Network of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS14 (Design), CS18 -(Active Transport) and CS20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011)."
