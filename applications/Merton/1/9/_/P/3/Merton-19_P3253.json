  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: 0001-180MHS; 0002-180MHS; 0006-180MHS.Rev2; 0007-180MHS.Rev2; 0008-180MHS.Rev2; 0010-180MHS.Rev2; 0011-180MHS.Rev2; 0009-180MHS.Rev2. ",
    "Condition : 3 - The development approved under this application along with the development approved at 182 Merton High Street (Council Ref:19/P3201), shall be implemented at the same time and shall be fully completed as one operation. At no time shall the new residential flat built under this permission be occupied for residential use until the approved external works at 182 Merton High Street (Council Ref:19/P3201), are complete.\r\n\r\nReason - To ensure that the development proposed results in a co-ordinated built form, and therefore to comply with policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014. The works would not be acceptable without this condition in place given that development to one property only would leave the rear of the terrace appearing incomplete.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - No part of the development hereby approved shall be occupied until evidence has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority confirming that the development has achieved CO2 reductions of not less than a 19% improvement on Part L regulations 2013, and internal water consumption rates of no greater than 105 litres per person per day.",
    "Condition : 5 - The facing materials used in the development hereby permitted shall match those of the existing building in materials, style, colour, texture and, in the case of brickwork, bonding, coursing and pointing. In addition, the front face of the mansard roof extension shall be finished in grey tiles.",
    "Condition : 6 - Carbon emissions evidence requirements for Post Construction stage assessments must provide:\r\n\"\tDetailed documentary evidence confirming the Target Emission Rate (TER), Dwelling Emission Rate (DER) and compliance with the 19% improvement of DER over TER based on 'As Built' SAP outputs (i.e. dated outputs with accredited energy assessor name; registration number, assessment status, plot number and development address); OR, where applicable:\r\n\"\tA copy of revised/final calculations as detailed in the assessment methodology based on 'As Built' SAP outputs; AND\r\n\"\tConfirmation of Fabric Energy Efficiency (FEE) performance where SAP section 16 allowances (i.e. CO2 emissions associated with appliances and cooking, and site-wide electricity generation technologies) have been included in the calculation\r\n\r\nWater efficiency evidence requirements for post construction stage assessments must provide:\r\n\"\tDocumentary evidence representing the dwellings 'As Built'; detailing:\r\no\tthe type of appliances/ fittings that use water in the dwelling (including any specific water reduction equipment with the capacity / flow rate of equipment);\r\no\tthe size and details of any rainwater and grey-water collection systems provided for use in the dwelling; AND:\r\n\"\tWater Efficiency Calculator for New Dwellings; OR\r\n\"\tWhere different from design stage, provide revised Water Efficiency Calculator for New Dwellings and detailed documentary evidence (as listed above) representing the dwellings 'As Built'\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - The applicant should be aware that the site may provide a useful habitat for swifts. Swifts are currently in decline in the UK and in order to encourage and improve the conservation of swifts the applicant is advised to consider the installation of a swift nesting box/bricks on the site.",
    "Condition : 8 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable with amendments.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n"
