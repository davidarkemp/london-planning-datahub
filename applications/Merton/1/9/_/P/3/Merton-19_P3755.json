    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would provide a poor standard of accommodation for both residential units by reason of a poor outlook and poor access to natural light to both bedrooms. As such the proposal fails to comply with DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS14 of Merton's Core Strategy (2011) and Policy 3.5 of The London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 2 - The site lies within a designated Neighbourhood Parade. The proposal would result in the loss of a commercial unit which makes a positive contribution to the vitality of the Neighbourhood Parade. The proposed change of use and visual alterations to facilitate residential use has not been justified and is considered to be visually harmful to the locality and detrimental to its vitality, in conflict with Policies DM R1 b), DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011 and Policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
