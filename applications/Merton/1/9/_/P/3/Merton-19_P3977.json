  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The demolition of the existing building and the design of the proposed replacement building is considered to result in a loss of an undesignated heritage asset which would cause substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Section 16 of the NPPF (National Planning Policy Framework 2019), Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D4 of the Merton Council's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
