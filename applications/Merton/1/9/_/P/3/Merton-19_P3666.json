    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the number of bedrooms, and associated potential occupancy, would result in an unneighbourly intensification of the use of the site, which would have the potential to be harmful to the residential character and amenities of neighbouring occupiers and by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use and number of individuals. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM H5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
