  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the internal layout and staircore arrangement, would result in a high proportion of single aspect and units that are not fully dual aspect, and, with a reliance on winter gardens for primarily single aspect units facing east towards a busy main road would result in a poor living environment for future occupants. The proposals would be contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), the objectives of Standard 29 of the London Plan Housing SPG 2016, policy CS.14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011), and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the metropolitan planning objective of optimising housing potential, as set out in policy 3.4 of the London Plan, the proposals by reason of their architectural form and facing materials, would result in a development that fails to relate positively and appropriately to local character to the detriment of the visual amenities of the area and failing to deliver a housing development of the highest quality in relation to its context. The proposals would be contrary to policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), the objectives of Standard 1 of the London Plan Housing SPG 2016, policy CS.14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011), and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of the location of the site on a busy main road where traffic conditions result in queuing and congestion giving rise to a hostile living environment, juxtaposed with the provision of residential units at ground floor level with front doors entering directly into the main living space, and the limited degree of setback from the public highway, insufficient defensible space, insufficient soft landscaping and screening, coupled with the limited private amenity space to the rear, accessible only through bedrooms, would result in a poor quality residential environment for future occupants and a substandard living environment. The proposals would be contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS.14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011), and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n"
