    "Reason : 1 - The application description states the proposed rear extension would have the following dimensions from natural ground: an eaves height of 2.636m and a maximum height of 3m; however, the described dimensions conflict with the submitted plans which are shown from the top of slab. The applicant has failed to provide a clear and accurate description of the proposed development. In particular, the maximum height of the extension as described on the submitted application form conflict with the submitted plans. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (1)(2)(a) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. "
