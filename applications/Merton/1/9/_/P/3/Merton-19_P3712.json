    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in a multiplicity of accesses onto the public highway, which would increase the risks of hazards and inconvenience to all users of the road, detract from the general free flow of traffic and be detrimental to the conditions of vehicle and pedestrian safety, including a substandard crossing width, contrary to policies London Plan Policy 6.3, Core Strategy Policy CS20 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan DM T2 and DM T5.",
    "Reason : 2 - The scale, size, materials and positioning of the fence and gate are considered to have an undue detrimental effect on the appearance of the surrounding area and streetscene, and policies of the Wimbledon West Conservation Area, and historic Wimbledon Village. Therefore, the proposal does not comply with the principles of polices DM D2, DM D3 & DM D4 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the increased area of hardstanding within the front garden will not unduly impact the health of a significant mature tree, important to the character of the area and the streetscene, and heritage assets of the Wimbledon West Conservation Area and historic Wimbledon Village. Therefore, the proposal does not comply with the principles of polices DM D2, DM D3, DM D4 & DM O2 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
