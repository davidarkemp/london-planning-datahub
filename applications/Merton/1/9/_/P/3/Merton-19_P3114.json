    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: TSL/ARF/01; TSL/ARF/02; TSL/ARF/03; TSL/ARF/04",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied at any time other than for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling known as 1 Eldertree Way, Mitcham CR4 1AJ.\r\n\r\nReason:  To safeguard the amenities of neighbouring residents, to prevent the unauthorised introduction of an independent use and to ensure compliance with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Condition : 5 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: The applicant is advised that in order for the use of the building to remain lawful and within the scope of condition 4 of planning permission reference 19/P3114 its use must be for purposes strictly incidental to the enjoyment of the house known as Eldertree Way. For the avoidance of doubt it may be used for purposes such as a gym or hobbies room. It must not be occupied or otherwise used in a manner that would be considered anciallry to the use of the host dwelling such as use as a granny annexe or for occupation by others. Use for such purpose would be unlawful and could be the subject of enforcement action under the Planning Acts.  ",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its height, depth, scale and siting, would be an overly dominant and un-neighbourly form of development resulting in undue sense of enclosure and exacerbate the outlook to the detriment of the amenities of the neighbouring property, contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
