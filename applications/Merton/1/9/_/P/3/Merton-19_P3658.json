    "Reason : 1 - The proposed infill extension by reason of its height, depth and proximity to the boundary would result in a significant sense of enclosure, and the loss of daylight and outlook to the neighbouring occupier at 214 Grand Drive. On this basis the proposal is considered not to be acceptable in terms of its impact on neighbouring amenity contrary to Policy DMD2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant has failed to provide drawings that accurately show the existing proportions of the property. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
