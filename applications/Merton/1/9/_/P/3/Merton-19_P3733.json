    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would increase the demand for on-street parking in the area including short term drop off and pick up parking. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the additional vehicles likely to be generated by the development, including those associated with short term pick up and drop of parking, on a road used by a bus route, where traffic flows have necessitated their management by the introduction of a traffic controlled junction, and where the vehicle/pedestrian access is located immediately adjacent to a bus stop, can be accommodated on the road network without compromising highway safety and efficiency. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 6.3 of the London Plan (2016), Policy CS.20 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policy DM T2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
