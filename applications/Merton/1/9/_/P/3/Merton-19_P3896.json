    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The size, siting, materials and design of the rear roof extensions represent an unneighbourly form of development that is visually intrusive, resulting in a loss of light & outlook, unduly dominant and which fails to respect the appearance, materials, scale, bulk, proportions and character of the original building and its wider setting including views from the Lambton Road Conservation Area and is therefore be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 & 7.8 in the London Plan 2016, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2, DM D3 & DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
