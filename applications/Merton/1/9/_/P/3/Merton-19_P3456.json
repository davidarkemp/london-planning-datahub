    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its depth, height, design and mass, would result in a harmful impact on the character of the host building and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011 and Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\n\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n   ii) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its depth, height and mass would result in an overbearing and overlooking impact along with harmful loss of outlook to the neighbouring amenities at 6 Queensland Avenue.  The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policy DM D2 of the sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011 and Policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016. "
