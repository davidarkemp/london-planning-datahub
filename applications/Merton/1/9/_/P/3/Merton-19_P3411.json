    "Reason : 1 - The submitted plans and elevations are inconsistent with the dimensions stated on the application form and as a consequence the consultation letters provided to neighbours. The drawing 'side elevation as proposed 03' shows the roof extending beyond the single storey outrigger to be 3.4m adjoining the northern neighbour No.30. This elevation is inconsistent with the roof detail of drawing 'rear elevation as proposed 01'. Further the projecting skylights are not shown on drawing 'side elevation as proposed 03'. Additionally the scale bar provided on the plan does not scale to the described dimensions of the drawing 'side elevation as proposed 03'. The application cannot, therefore, be assessed on the basis of the submitted information as stated in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.4 (2)(a)(ii) & (3)(b) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to provide a plan accurately indicating the proposed development, with no northern elevation provided. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (2)(b) & (3)(b) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 3 - With the retention of the original single storey outrigger to the rear, the extension would extend beyond an original side elevation of the dwellinghouse (fascia/wall) and would therefore be classed as a side extension. The extension would therefore have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, thereby breaching the threshold of  Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (J) (iii) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
