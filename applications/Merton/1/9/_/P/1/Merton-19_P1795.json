    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its height, depth, scale and siting, would be an overly dominant and un-neighbourly form of development resulting in an undue sense of enclosure, visual intrusion and loss of daylight and sunlight to the detriment of the amenities of the neighbouring properties (No.45 and 49 Edgehill Road, Mitcham) contrary to policies 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
