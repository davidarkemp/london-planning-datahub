    "Reason : 1 - The outbuilding by reason of its design, size and siting is considered an unneighbourly form of development which would be overly dominant and harmful to the amenity of neighbours  through loss of privacy, outlook and visual intrusion and is unsympathetic to the design, scale, bulk and proportions of the surrounding buildings and character of the local area contrary to the principles of Policies 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011\r\n \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
