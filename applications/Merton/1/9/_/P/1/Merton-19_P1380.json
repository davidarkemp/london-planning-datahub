  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling, by virtue of its bulk, scale, width, height and design would result in a visually unbalancing effect to the row of terraced dwellings and would adversely affect the spacious character of the wider estate, contrary to Policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Sites and Polices Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed developemnt, by reason of its height and proximity to the boundary, would result in material harm to the occupiers of Nos.2 and 3 Mountcombe House by way of overbearing form, loss of outlook, unreasonable sense of enclosure and loss of daylight and sunlight, contrary to Policy DMD2 of rthe Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in accommodation that fails to meet the minimum space standards for residential accommodation as set out in the Mayors Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance and the Nationally Descriobed Housing Standards and is therefore contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016 and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of the lack of car parking to serve the proposed dwelling in a low PTAL area, would result in an increased demand for off-site car parking, leading to an increase in indiscriminate parking occurring in the surrounding area, which would have an adverse impact on highway safety, contrary to Policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM T2 and DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal introduces a more vulnerable use (residential dwelling) into an area within Flood Zone 2, the application is not accompanied by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment to demonstrate that the development would be safe for its lifetime taking account of the vulnerability of its users, without increasing flood risk elsewhere and, where possible, to reduce flood risk overall, contrary to Policy 5.12 of the London PLan 2016, Policy CS16 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policie DM F1 and DM F2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
