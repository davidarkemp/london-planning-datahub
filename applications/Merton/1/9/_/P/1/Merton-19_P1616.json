    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, in conjunction with an existing extension, would result in a ground floor rear extension of 5.4 metres and by reason of its length design and siting, exacerbated by other buildings on site would have a detrimental impact on the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining property at 15 Homefield Gardens in terms of loss of outlook, daylight and sunlight. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The single storey rear extension by reason of its design and materials, fails to respect the appearance and character of the original building and its surroundings, contrary to the principles of policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
