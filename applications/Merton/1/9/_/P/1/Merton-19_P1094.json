    "Reason : 1 - The following plans were considered with this application: A380:P:101, A380:P:102, A380:P:103, A380:P:104, A380:P:105, A380:P:106, A380:P:107, A380:P:110, A380:P:111, A380:P:112, A380:P:113, A380:P:114, A380:P:115, A380:P:116, A380:P:117 and A380:P:118",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The scale, form, design and elevated position of the extension is considered to have an undue detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the area, the host building and on neighbouring amenity. Therefore, the proposal does not comply with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016. "
