    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its eaves height, length, scale and siting, would result in an overbearing and un-neighbourly form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the streetscene and on neighbouring amenity in terms of loss of light, loss of outlook, an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to London Plan policies D3 and D4, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2 & DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming.
