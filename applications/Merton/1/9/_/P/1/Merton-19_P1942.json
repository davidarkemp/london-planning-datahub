    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling, by reason of its height, depth, scale, siting and design, would be an unduly dominant, incongruous and unneighbourly form of development, which would fail to relate positively and appropriately to surrounding residence. It would be detrimental to the amenities of 63B and 65 Hartfield Road by way of visual intrusion, cause overlooking and resulting in an unacceptable increased sense of enclosure. The proposal would be contrary to Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n   ii) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed layout would result in an unsatisfactory environment for future occupiers, arising from a failure to meet the Council's minimum garden space standard as a single regular shaped amenity space. The proposals would be contrary to policies 3.5 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy and DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011). \r\n"
