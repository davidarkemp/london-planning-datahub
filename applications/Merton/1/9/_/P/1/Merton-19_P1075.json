    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n   ii) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The scale, form and positioning of the proposal is considered to have undue detrimental effect on neighbouring amenity, specifically the property 53 Garfield Road. Therefore, the proposal does not comply with the principle policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016."
