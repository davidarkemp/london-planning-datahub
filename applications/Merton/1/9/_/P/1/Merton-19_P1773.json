    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension and conversion of the existing basement would by reason of its design and layout result in a poor outlook and natural light, to the detriment of the environment for future occupiers and an inconvenient and fragmented arrangement of amenity space, with a small below ground level terrace oversailed by steps providing access to the flat but contributing to a sense of enclosure and a ground level patio garden that is not directly accessed from habitable space that  comprises the basement flat, also to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to policy DM D2 of the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016 and Policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n"
