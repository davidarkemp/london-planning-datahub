    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the number of bedrooms, and associated potential occupancy, would result in an unneighbourly overdevelopment and over intensification of the site, resulting in a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers by reason of poor ceiling heights and outlook in rooms 9 and 10, and would likely be harmful to the residential character and amenities of the surrounding area by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM H5 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy 2011.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome.\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe plans which this decision relates are: 19007-A-03-01, 19007-A-05-01, 19007-A-3-01 Rev 1.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011)."
