In particular, the depth of the extension as described on the submitted application form conflict with the submitted plans. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (1)(2)(a) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
