    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions, by reason of their design, siting, scale, bulk and appearance, would result in an incongruous, overly bulky, and dominating form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its design & layout would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal floorspace standards, external private amenity space standards and sufficient outlook to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers, contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict.
