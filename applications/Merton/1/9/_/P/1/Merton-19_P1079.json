    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey extension, by reason of its height, depth, scale, siting and design, would be an unduly dominant, incongruous and unneighbourly form of development, which would fail to relate positively and appropriately to local character. It would be detrimental to the amenities of 135, 137 and 139 Revelstoke Road by way of visual intrusion, and to the visual amenities of the area, contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
