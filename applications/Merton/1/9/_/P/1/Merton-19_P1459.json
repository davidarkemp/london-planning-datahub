    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: D4362.0.PL02. ",
    "Condition : 3 - The materials to be used for the installation of the ventilation duct hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - The use hereby permitted shall not be open to customers except between the hours of 11am and Midnight Monday to Saturday and 11am and 11pm Sundays and Public Holidays and no staff shall be present at the premises one hour after the closing time. ",
    "Condition : 5 - Noise levels from the new plant/machinery/extraction system associated with the new ductwork installation shall be enclosed and soundproofed so as not to increase the background noise level by more than 2dB (A) (L90 5 minute measurement period), and there shall be no increase in one third octave band dB between 50Hz and 160Hz when measured at the boundary of the nearest noise-sensitive property. \r\n\r\nReason: To protect the amenities of future occupiers and those in the local vicinity and ensure compliance with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policy 7.15 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies DM D2, DM D3, DM EP2 and DM EP4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Condition : 6 - The use hereby permitted shall not commence until detailed plans and specifications of the kitchen ventilation system, including details of sound attenuation and odour control measures have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme submitted shall have regard to the technical requirements of the document 'Control of Odour and Noise from Commercial Kitchen Extract Systems' as produced by EMAQ dated 2018 (or updated document). Should the type of cooking change, a further assessment shall be submitted in accordance with the above. Odour from the new extraction and odour control unit shall be designed and installed so that cooking odour is not harmful to other premises. The kitchen ventilation extract system shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications before the use commences and shall be permanently retained as such thereafter. ",
    "Condition : 7 - For avoidance of doubt, this application grants only the change of use and alterations to the shop front. The advertising and signage required for the new takeaway business would need to seek a separate application for advertisement consent. ",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVES:\r\nThe applicant is advised to ensure that:\r\n- No obstruction or cowl is to be fitted above the extract opening; \r\n- Flexible couplings and mountings are used between the ductwork and the walls so there is no transmission of vibration.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay."
