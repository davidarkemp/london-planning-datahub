    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front roof extension and balcony by reason of its design, siting, bulk and massing represents a visually intrusive, overly dominant feature and fails to respect the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 & 7.6, Policies CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
