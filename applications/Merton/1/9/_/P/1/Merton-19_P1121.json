    "Reason : 1 - The loss of the existing garages would remove the parking facility for the existing dwelling, No.118 Streatham Road, thereby resulting in displacement parking on the road network which would result in additional congestion and adverse impacts on highway safety, contrary to Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would introduce a potentially noisy activity with increased traffic movements. The application, by reason of the lack of supporting information and mitigation, has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would be acceptable in terms of noise emissions, air quality and traffic movements, contrary to Policies DM D2, DM T2, DM EP2 and DM EP4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would result in an increase in traffic movements and servicing requirements. The application, by reason of the lack of supporting information, has failed to demonstrate that the impact on traffic congestion in the area would be acceptable in terms of highway safety, contrary to Policies 5.17, 6.3 and 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, Policies CS17, CS18 and CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM T2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n"
