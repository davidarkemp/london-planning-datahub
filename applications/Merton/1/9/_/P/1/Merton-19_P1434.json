    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side extension by reason of its siting, scale, bulk & design would present an incongruous and overbearing form of development resulting in the loss of an important visual gap between terraces, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the street scene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy policy CS14, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions."
