    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer extension, by virtue of its bulk, scale, form, design and positioning would result in an obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would detract from the appearance of the host building and be out of keeping with, and detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area.  It is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy CS14 of the Council's adopted Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed rear roof terrace, by virtue of its location and lack of screening, is considered to cause harm to the amenity of neighbouring properties.  It is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy DMD3 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
