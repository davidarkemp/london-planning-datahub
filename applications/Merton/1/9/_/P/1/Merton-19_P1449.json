    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part demolition and external alterations of the Coach house would fail to sympathetically enhance or preserve the non-designated heritage asset resulting in material harm to its appearance and significance toward the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation area. The converted coach house would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of external amenity due its irregular shape and closeness to the new detached dwellinghouse and windows on the first floor (southern) elevation would immediately overlook into the garden of 57 Langdale Avenue. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 3.5, 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DMD1, DMD2, DMD3 and DMD4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed detached dwellinghouse, by reason of its design, proportions, siting and layout, would be considered an unneighbourly form of development sitting uncomfortably and awkwardly with the Coach house and 57 Langdale Avenue. It would fail to introduce a dwelling of high quality design which would complement or positively contribute to the Langdale Avenue streetscene or views from Commonside West, and would overall present a cramped layout on the plot. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 3.5, 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DMD1, DMD2 and DMD4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would likely generate additional need for parking along Langdale Avenue. In the absence of relevant or sufficient evidence to demonstrate that there would be adequate parking in the vicinity, and parking demand would not be inappropriately exacerbated, it is considered the proposal would be contrary to Policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DMT3 of Merton's Site and Policies Plan 2014.  ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application however the application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
