    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of design, position, bulk and massing, represents an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive, detracting from the appearance, scale and proportions of the host dwelling, failing to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale grain and spacing of surrounding buildings, existing street patterns and the character and quality of the public realm and as such would be harmful to the visual amenities of the Liberty Grove streetscene and neighbouring occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of design, layout and position would a) fail to provide a high standard of quality residential accommodation and amenity and as such would be harmful to the amenity of future occupiers through poor quality outdoor amenity space and b) result in a loss of light, outlook and privacy to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
