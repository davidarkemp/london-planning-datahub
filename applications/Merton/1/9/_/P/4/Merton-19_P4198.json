  "description": "APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF USE FROM SINGLE DWELLINGHOUSE (CLASS C3) TO A HOUSE IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION (HMO) FOR UP TO 12 PEOPLE (USE CLASS SUI GENERIS) COMPRISING 6X DOUBLE BEDROOMS WITH 2X COMMUNAL KITCHEN/LIVING ROOMS. INVOLVING CONVERSION OF FRONT GARAGE DOOR TO A WINDOW. ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of the number of bedrooms and associated occupancy, would give rise to an intensification of the use of the site, which in the absence of details pertaining to the property's day to day management or safety and security measures for future residents, would have the potential to be harmful to the residential character and amenities of neighbouring occupiers and by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM H5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that there is sufficient off-street parking availability along Hillcross Avenue and surrounding streets so as to ensure there would not be an increase in parking pressure and the potential for the displacement of parking to the detriment of local residents and the general conditions of highway and pedestrian safety. The proposals would be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan Policy DM T2 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS20. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would have a harmful impact on pedestrian and highway safety in the absence of measures to prevent vehicles driving across the footway or pelican crossing. The proposal would be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan Policy DM T5 and Merton Core Strategy Policies CS20. ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
