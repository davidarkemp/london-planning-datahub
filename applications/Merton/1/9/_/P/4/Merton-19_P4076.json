    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would by reason of its design, size, bulk and siting, be an unduly dominant and inappropriate form of development, unsympathetic to the appearance of the existing and neighbouring properties and would thereby fail to respect the prevailing positive characteristics of the area or to conserve and enhance the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area and would be contrary to London Plan (2016) policies 7.6 and 7.8, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
