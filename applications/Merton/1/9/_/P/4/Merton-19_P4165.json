    "Reason : 1 - The proposal due to the conversion of the front garden to forecourt parking alongside the loss of a large section of holly hedge would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the conservation area. It would therefore be contrary London Plan 2016 policy 7.4, 7.6, 7.8, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2, DMD3 and DMD4.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a legal agreement preventing vehicles that would overhang the public highway (footpath, footway or carriageway) from being parking on the created forecourt, the proposal would be contrary to Core Strategy CS 20 and SPP Policies DMT2 and DMT3.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
