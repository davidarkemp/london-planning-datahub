  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, siting, and form would constitute a cramped and incongruous development that would be harmful to the character of the area. The layout of the building on the site which provides no front setback would appear out of context within the suburban streetscene, whilst the enclosed passageway would undermine the principle of having an active frontage and creates additional appearance issues. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.6, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy policies CS5, CS13 and CS14 and Merton SPP policies DM D1 and DM D2.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to provide a high standard of living conditions for the future occupants of the dwelling, due to poor outlook, narrow floor area, inadequate daylight and inadequate external amenity space. In addition, blocking-up the kitchen window of the existing upper residential unit at No 12 Goat Road, would fail to safeguard the residential amenity of adjacent neighbours. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policy 3.5 and 7.6 and Merton SPP policies DM D2.",
    "Reason : 3 - The development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to Policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016, Policies CS18 and CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM T1 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposals fail to provide an adequate level of external amenity space to meet the likely needs of future occupiers and would be further compromised by potential shared use for cycle storage, to the detriment of the quality of environment for future occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - The submission fails to demonstrate how the proposal would minimise water use and reduce Carbon Dioxide emissions so as to achieve a high standard of sustainability, make efficient use of resources and mitigate against climate change. The proposal is contrary to Policies 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the London Plan 2016 and Policy CS15 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
