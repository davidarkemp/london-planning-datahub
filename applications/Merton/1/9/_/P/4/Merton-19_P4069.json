    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension, by reason of its bulk, form, scale and design, fails to respect the proportions of the host dwelling, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling, terrace, and by extension, the wider area, contrary to policies 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, CS14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011 and DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension, by reason of its form, scale, bulk and siting, is considered to be an un-neighbourly development. The proposal would result in a loss of outlook, have an overbearing form, and result in the loss of daylight and sunlight on the occupants at No. 14 Bayham Road. To the occupants at No. 18 Bayham Road, the proposal would result in a loss of outlook, have an overbearing form, and result in the loss of daylight. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
