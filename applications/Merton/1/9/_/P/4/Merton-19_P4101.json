Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in ptosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. We would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures will be undertaken to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 020 3577 9483 or \r\ne-mailining wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk Application forms shoule be completed on line via www.thameswater.co.uk.
