    "Reason : 1 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would maximise affordable housing provision or secure the delivery of an acceptable quantum and tenure mix of affordable housing and would fail to meet the objectives of maximising the delivering of affordable housing and creating mixed and balanced communities, contrary to policies 3.8, 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 of the London Plan 2016, The Mayor's Affordable Housing and Viability SPG (2017), Policies H4 and H5 of the Intend to Publish Draft London Plan, Policy CS8 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and the aims and objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding metropolitan planning objective of optimising housing potential, as set out in policy 3.4 of the London Plan, the proposals by reason of their massing and bulk, would appear excessively prominent and visually dominant when viewed from London Road and surrounding vantage points, including from the nearby Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area, failing to deliver a housing development of the highest quality in relation to its context and to the detriment of the wider visual amenities of the area. The proposal would result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The proposals would be contrary to policies 3.5, 7.4, 7.5. 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policy CS.14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011), and policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposals, by reason of housing mix, specifically the lack of 3 bedroomed units, would fail to further the objectives of the Council's adopted indicative housing mix for new developments, which seeks to provide an appropriate mix of smaller and larger units to meet a mix of different households as part of a wider set of housing objectives that encourage socially mixed and sustainable communities with a greater choice and better mix in the size type and location of housing.  The applicant has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Council that the site is unsuitable to apply the borough level indicative mix. The proposals would be contrary to policy DM.H2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, massing, orientation and fenestration, would result in material harm to the amenity of adjoining occupiers in Justin Plaza by way of loss of early morning sunlight, daylight, loss of outlook and both actual and perceived sense of overlooking and loss of privacy, contrary to Policies 7.14 and 7.15 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DMD2 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposals fail to provide an adequate level of external children's play space to meet the likely needs of future occupiers, to the detriment of the quality of environment for future occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to Policy 3.6 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 6 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Council, that the proposals would achieve energy efficiency improvements such that they would make the fullest contribution towards minimising carbon dioxide emissions, to the detriment of mitigating against the potential impact on climate change. The proposals would therefore fail to comply with the objectives of London plan policies 5.2 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016), policy S12 of the draft New London plan 2019 and the GLA's guidance on preparing energy assessments (2018).",
    "Reason : 7 - None of the proposed units would be suitable for wheelchair users and could not be adapted to be suitable for wheelchair users in the future, due to the lack of a lift proposed for this 6 storey building. The proposed development would conflict with Policy 3.8 of the London Plan, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
