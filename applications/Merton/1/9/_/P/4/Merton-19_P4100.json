    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling, by virtue of its bulk, scale and height would result in a development that would be out of scale for this location and would not reinforce the character of this area's built form. The proposal would not create a coherent or comfortable townscape. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its height and close proximity to neighbouring residential buildings along Queen Elizabeth Gardens, Cedars Road and Chenab Court is such that the proposal would result in an unacceptable reduction in the outlook enjoyed by these properties, forming an overbearing, oppressive development. In addition, the proposal would result in harmful loss of light to ground floor windows of 15-17 Elizabeth Gardens and ground floor windows of Homefield residential block, alongside losses of sunlight to the amenity spaces of the existing flats within the subject building. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DM2 of the Sites and Polies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
