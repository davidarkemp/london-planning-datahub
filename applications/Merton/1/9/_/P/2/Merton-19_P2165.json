    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, height, massing, detailing and siting would be an overly bulky and dominant form of development resulting in an overdevelopment of the site, which fails to respect the character and appearance of the Princes Road and Trinity Road street scenes, general pattern of development within the area and would fail to preserve or enhance the setting of the adjacent South Park Gardens Conservation Area, contrary to Policies DM D2 (Design Considerations in all developments) and DM D4 (Managing heritage assets) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), CS14 (Design) of Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policy 7.4 (Local Character) of the London Plan (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, located in an area with a PTAL score of 6a (very good), would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a signed legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement, the proposal would be contrary to contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of its design and layout would fail to achieve a high standard of residential accommodation as a result on communitive shortfalls in cycle parking, bin storage, lack of private amenity space, lack of natural bathroom ventilation and overlooking/loss of privacy to the bathroom of flat 1. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policies DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments) and DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel) of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan CS 14 (Design) and CS 18 (active Transport) of Merton's Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that there is no viable demand for any other community uses on the site. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy DM C1 Community facilities of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS 11 Infrastructure of Merton's Core Planning Strategy (July 2011)."
