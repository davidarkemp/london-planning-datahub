  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, scale, bulk, massing and positioning would represent an unneighbourly overdevelopment that would result in visual intrusion, overshadowing of gardens and a loss of outlook and privacy to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring residents contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2020), policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to secure the delivery of affordable housing, and plans identifying how different social tenure units will be provided in a manner that would enable their effective delivery, or an offsite contribution towards affordable housing would fail to meet the requirements of policies H4 and H5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS 8 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposals by reason of design and siting would result in the loss and inadequate replacement of mature trees that provide important amenity and environmental value to the location and fail to secure adequate replacements to mitigate for their loss contrary to policies G7 of the London plan 2021, CS13 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Policy DM O2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the design of the dwellings would mitigate against the impact of noise and poor air quality on future occupiers given the surrounding environment being located at a busy main road junction and would thereby fail to meet the objectives of London Plan 2021 policies D14 & SI1 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan policies DM EP2 & DM EP4.",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the propsals would not exacerbate pressure on kerbside parking locally to the detriment of the amenities of existing residents. The proposals would therefore be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy T6.1 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM T2 & DM T3 and Core Strategy 2011 Policy CS20.",
    "Reason : 6 - The applicant has failed to submit information to demonstrate that due to the location and confined nature of the site, traffic and construction activity associated with the development and accessing can be managed in such a way as not to adversely impact or cause inconvenience in the day to day lives of those living and working nearby or to cause congestion on strategically important routes contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM D2 & DM T2.",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposals by reason of the absence of parking facilities on site for those with disabilities, would fail to provide for an inclusive environment for all occupants regardless of their mobility contrary to London Plan 2021 policies T6.1 & D7 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DM T3.   ",
    "Reason : 8 - The proposals by reason of design and layout with habitable rooms in close proximity to walkways would fail to provide adequate levels of privacy to protect the amenity of future occupiers contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2020 and DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was engaged in various issues arising during consideration of the application but these matters were not resolved. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
