    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no window, door or other opening other than those expressly authorised by this permission shall be constructed in the side elevations without planning permission first being obtained from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 5 - The screening or enclosure to the balcony as shown on the approved plans shall be implemented before the development is first occupied and retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Condition : 6 - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 7 - The development shall not commence until details of the provision to accommodate all site workers', visitors' and construction vehicles and loading /unloading arrangements during the construction process have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The approved details must be implemented and complied with for the duration of the construction process.",
    "Condition : 8 - No demolition or development shall take place until a written scheme of investigation (WSI) has been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed WSI, which shall include the statement of significance and research objectives, and\r\n\r\nA.\tThe programme and methodology of site investigation and recording and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organization to undertake the agreed works.\r\n\r\nB.\tThe programme for post-investigation assessment and subsequent analysis, publication & dissemination and deposition of resulting material. This part of the condition shall not be discharged until these elements have been fulfilled in accordance with the programme set out in the WSI.\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - No development approved by this permission shall be commenced until a detailed scheme for the provision of surface and foul water drainage has been implemented in accordance with details that have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The drainage scheme will dispose of surface water by means of a sustainable drainage system (SuDS) at the agreed runoff rate (no more than 2l/s), in accordance with drainage hierarchy contained within the London Plan Policy (5.12, 5.13 and SPG) and the advice contained within the National SuDS Standards. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - Prior to the commencement of development, the applicant shall submit a detailed proposal on how drainage and groundwater  will be managed and mitigated during and post construction (permanent phase), for example through the implementation of passive drainage measures around the basement structure.\r\n",
    "Condition : 11 - Vegetation within the project area has been identified as being suitable for use by breeding birds. Given their protection, development must be sympathetic to the value of this habitat and potential impacts on breeding birds, their eggs, nests and young. The breeding bird season is generally accepted as being between March and September.\r\n\r\nIf vegetative features such as introduced shrubs are to be removed by the works then reasonable avoidance measures should be put in place such as:\r\n\r\na) Undertake vegetation removal between October and February where possible;\r\nb) If vegetation removal is to be undertaken between the months of March and September,\r\n\r\na pre works check should be carried out, 24hrs prior to commencing any activities, by a competent ecologist to ensure that no nesting birds are present. If birds are found to be nesting, works will need to be delayed in those areas until it is confirmed that nesting has been completed. \r\n\r\nWork should be conducted outside of the breeding bird season between March and September inclusive.",
    "Condition : 12 - To increase the ecological functionality of the site for nesting birds, two Schwegler 1N General Purpose Nest Boxes, or similarly approved boxes must be installed onto the walls or suitable surrounding trees to the development, prior to completion of the development, positioned at least two metres above the ground facing between north or eastwards.\r\n\r\nReason\r\nIn the interests of preserving biodiversity across the site, in accordacne with Policy DM O2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. \r\n",
    "Condition : 13 - INFORMATIVE\r\nAreas of woodland considered suitable for foraging and commuting bats are present along adjacent to the northern boundary along North View Road.\r\nAlthough the wider area is considered to have high suitability to support foraging and commuting bats the suitability within the red-line boundary is considered low. That said, the physical characteristics and current\r\nmanagement of the boundary features should be maintained to prevent disturbance to potential commuting lines. The extent of disturbance should be reduced where possible employing a sensitive lighting scheme during\r\nconstruction works, and artificial security lighting should not be installed post construction directed at the habitats mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIf lighting is required, a scheme should be devised and positioned to have minimal disturbance following the guidance of an ecologist.\r",
    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE\r\nBats are highly mobile and can change roost sites throughout the year and from season to season. If bats are found on site after works have commenced all works must cease and the advice of a suitably qualified ecologist be sought.",
    "Condition : 15 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIf the development of the site does not begin within twelve months of this initial survey it will be necessary to conduct an additional survey to determine if bats are roosting within the buildings on site. ",
    "Condition : 16 - INFORMATIVE\r\nDuring and post construction, a sensitive lighting scheme should be implemented to prevent disturbance to commuting and foraging bats in the local area. Lighting should be directed away from vegetative features to the northern elevation, and light overspill of over 1lux should be avoided within these vegetated areas.\r",
    "Condition : 17 - INFORMATIVE\r\nAn integrated bat box such as a Schwegler 1F Bat tube, or similar approved shall be installed within the fabric of the building during construction. This feature should be positioned on a southern elevation, over a height of 5 metres, ideally close to the eaves of the new build. The flight line to the box should be unobstructed by vegetation of other structures.",
    "Condition : 18 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe written scheme of investigation will need to be prepared and implemented  by a suitably qualified professionally accredited archaeological practice in accordance with Historic England's Guidelines for Archaeological Projects in Greater London. This condition is exempt from deemed discharge under schedule 6 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Condition : 19 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNo surface water runoff should discharge onto the public highway including the public footway or highway. When it is proposed to connect to a public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.   Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).",
    "Condition : 20 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNo waste material, including concrete, mortar, grout, plaster, fats, oils and chemicals shall be washed down on the highway or disposed of into the highway drainage system.",
    "Condition : 21 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
