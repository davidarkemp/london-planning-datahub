    "Reason : 1 - The proposed porch extension would have a ground floor area exceeding 3sqm when measured externally, and its maximum height (measured from the ground level) would exceed 3m. This would exceed the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class D (b) and (c) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. Planning permission would therefore be required.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed side extension would adjoin to the porch extension thereby resulting in a wraparound addition. The overall enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. This would be contrary to the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A(j)(iii) of the GPDO (2015) (as amended). Planning permission would therefore be required."
