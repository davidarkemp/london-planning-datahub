    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: P-18.046-B B-01 Rev F, P-18.046-B A-01 Rev F, P-18.046-B A-02 Rev F, P-18.046-B A-03 Rev F, P-18.046-B A-04 Rev F, P-18.046-B A-05 Rev F, P-18.046-B A-06 Rev F, P-18.046-B A-07 Rev F, P-18.046-B A-08 Rev F & P-18.046-B A-09 Rev F",
    "Condition : 3 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied, the first floor bathroom window in the proposed north side elevation shall be glazed with obscure glass and fixed shut below 1.7m above the floor of the room and shall permanently maintained as such thereafter.",
    "Condition : 4 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 5 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The applicant/agent was provided with pre-application advice.\r\n   ii) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   iii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n   iv) The application was considered by the Planning Committee where the applicant/agent had the opportunity to speak to the committee and promote the application.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side extension by reason of its bulk, scale and design, would be un-neighbourly, coupled with the prominent location of the dwelling within the immediate streetscene, would constitute an obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would fail to reflect the design or complement the bulk and proportions of the original building to the detriment of the appearance of the host dwelling, and would result in the loss of openness between buildings along Carlingford Road, to the detriment of the streetscene and neighbouring amenity. \r\n\r\nThe proposal would be contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n"
