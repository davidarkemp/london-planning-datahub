    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to provide a clear and accurate description of the proposed development. In particular, the plans of the existing rear elevation do not reflect existing conditions of the site and the proposed and existing plans are incorrectly labelled with the wrong site address. The application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (1)(2)(a) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey extension, by reason of its size, siting and design would be visually intrusive and overly dominant, resulting in a loss of outlook, daylight/sunlight and would be harmful to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers 24 and 28 Charminster Avenue. The proposal would be therefore contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016."
