    "Reason : 1 - The outbuilding, by reason of its bulk, height and massing would be out of character with its surroundings, resulting in an unduly dominant form which would be visually intrusive to neighbouring occupiers, contrary to policy 7.6 of the London plan (2016) policy CS 14 of the London Borough of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding exceeds what may be reasonably considered as incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse. The floorspace of the outbuilding would be larger than the ground floor of the main dwelling and its extension. Although the activities designated on the plans of the outbuilding fall into categories that, individually, may be acceptable as incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse, taken together they occupy an unreasonable amount of space and, as a matter of fact and degree, it is considered that the outbuilding cannot be considered incidental and would have an impact toward neighbouring amenity, contrary to policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any formal pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
