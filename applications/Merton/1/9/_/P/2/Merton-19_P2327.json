The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",

The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Reason : 1 - The edge of the proposed roof extension closest to the eaves of the original roof is not less than 0.2 metres from the eaves, measured along the roof slope from the outside edge of the eaves; thereby breaching the threshold of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, B.2(b) (i)(bb). Planning permission is therefore required."
