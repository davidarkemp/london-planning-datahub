    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n   ii) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension, which comprises of an increased roof height, roof pitch and rear dormer window, is considered be out of keeping with the character of the terrace, and results in an adverse impact on the visual amenity and streetscape of the immediate area, contrary to policy DM D2 Design Considerations in all developments in the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and CS14 - Design of Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011)."
