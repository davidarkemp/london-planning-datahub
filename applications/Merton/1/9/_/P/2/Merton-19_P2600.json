    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of the size, design and layout of the top floor flat and the lack of private outdoor amenity space for the three upper floor flats would result in the provision of an unsatisfactory and cramped standard of accommodation for future occupiers failing to meet minimum floorspace and external amenity standards, detrimental to the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016),Sites and Policies Plan 2104 policy DM D2, the DCLG Technical Housing Standards (nationally described space standards) (2015) and London Plan Housing SPG Standard 26  .  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of the location of the communal garden and the entrance to flat 2, both accessible via an unlit service road off New Close, would fail to provide a layout that is of the highest quality externally, or achieves the highest standard of accessible and inclusive design, or is safe and secure and takes account of crime prevention, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would fail to meet the objectives of policy 3.5, 7.2 and 7.3 of the London Plan (2016), and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
