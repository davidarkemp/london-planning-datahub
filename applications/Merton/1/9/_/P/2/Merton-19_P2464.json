    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its design and siting would result in a poor outlook and lack of natural light to internal and external amenities and would entail access via an unmade access way to the detriment of the safety and security of future occupiers and the ambulant disabled, resulting overall in a poor quality environment for future occupiers. The proposal would be contrary to policies 7.2 and 7.3 of the London Plan (2015), and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n"
