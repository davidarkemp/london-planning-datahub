    "Condition : 1 - This written notice indicates that the proposed development would comply with condition A.4 of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (as amended by SI 2008 No. 2362 and SI 2013 No. 1101).  It is important to note that this written notice doesn't indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations or conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.  If you want confirmation that the proposed development would be lawful (e.g. on the basis that it would comply with all of the limitations and conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A), then you should submit an (optional) application to the local planning authority for a Lawful Development Certificate (LDC).",
    "Condition : 2 - It is a requirement of the above condition A.4 that the development shall be carried out in accordance with the details approved by the local planning authority, unless the local planning authority and the developer agree otherwise in writing.\r\nIt is a requirement of the above condition A.4 that the development shall be completed on or before 30th May 2016.\r\nIt is a requirement of the above condition A.4 that the developer shall notify the local planning authority of the completion of the development as soon as reasonably practicable after completion, and that this notification shall be in writing and shall include (a) the name of the developer, (b) the address or location of the development, and (c) the date of completion.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - Reasons 1\r\nThe applicant has failed to provide a clear and accurate description of the proposed development. In particular, the maximum height and eaves height of the extension as described on the submitted application form conflict with the submitted plans. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (1)(2)(a) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - Reasons 2\r\nThe proposed extension would extend from/beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, thereby breaching the threshold of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (J) (iii) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015; therefore, planning permission is required."
