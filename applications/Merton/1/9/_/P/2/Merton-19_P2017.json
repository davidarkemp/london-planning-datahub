    "Reason : 1 - The development proposal would lead to a conflict between members of the public waiting to board a bus, and restricting the passage of people trying to bypass the bus shelter due to a severely inadequate footway width. The proposal would restrict access for the mobility and visually impaired people. The proposal would be obtrusive adjoining the highway to the detriment of pedestrian safety. The proposal is contrary to London Plan Policy 6.3, Core Strategy Policy CS20 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan DM T2 and DM T5. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tSuggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
