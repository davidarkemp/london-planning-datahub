    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n   ii) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed replacement UPVC windows are considered to be an unsympathetic alteration, which would fail to respect the design and detailing of the original locally listed building and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Merton (Wimbledon North) Conservation Area, contrary to policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014)."
