    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension would extend from/beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, thereby breaching the threshold of  Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (J) (iii) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015; therefore, planning permission is required. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension would be within 2 metres of the boundary and would have an eaves height exceeding 3 metres, thereby breaching the threshold of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (i) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015; therefore, planning permission is required. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed extension would have a height greater than 4m, thereby breaching the threshold of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (g)(ii) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015; therefore, planning permission is required. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to provide a clear and accurate description of the proposed development. In particular, the maximum height, eaves height and depth of the extension as described on the submitted application form conflict with the submitted plans. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (1)(2)(a) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. "
