    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed part single part two storey rear extension, by reason of their design, materials, position, bulk and massing, represent an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive, detracting from the appearance, scale and proportions of the host dwelling, failing to enhance and relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale, proportions, height and massing of surrounding buildings and wider public realm. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
