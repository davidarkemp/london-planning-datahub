    "Reason : 1 - The proposed building would, by virtue of its size and siting result in an unneighbourly form of development that would result in the loss of light and outlook to the existing windows at ground and first floor level within the office building at 12 Ravensbury Terrace. The proposed building would also result in overlooking and loss of privacy and outlook to windows within the rear elevation of the approved flats (under planning permission Ref.19/P0069) at the rear of the site fronting the River Wandle. The design of the proposed building is therefore considered to be contrary to the aims of policy CS14 (Design) of the Adopted Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 (Design Considerations in all Developments) of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).\r\n\r\n"
