    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n   ii) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that it would be acceptable in terms of its impact upon drainage, groundwater conditions, structural/land stability or noise, and trees, and is contrary to policy 5.3, 5.13 of the London Plan and policies DM D2, DM EP2 and DM F2 of the adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
