  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its proximity to the highway, height, width, form and boundary treatment, would result in a cramped appearance which would be materially harmful to the character of the area and the appearance of the streetscene, contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, the London Character and Context SPG 2014, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its height and the proximity of the proposed building to the existing rear facing bedroom window of the existing first floor flat on site (No.219A Manor Road, Mitcham), would result in an overly dominant and materially harmful overbearing impact, which would result in a materially harmful loss of outlook to the existing occupiers, contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
