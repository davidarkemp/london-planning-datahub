    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front extension, by reason of its scale, form, design, positioning and bulk, would result in an incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area. Therefore, it is considered that the proposal conflicts with policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, policy CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n"
