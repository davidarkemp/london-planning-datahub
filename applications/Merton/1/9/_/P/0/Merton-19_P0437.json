    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey house by reason of its design, layout and siting fails to meet adopted minimum private amenity space standards to the detriment of the amenities of future and existing occupiers contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposed development would meet the Council's sustainability policy objectives or comply with adopted emissions reductions targets, contrary to policy 5.3 of the London Plan (2016) and policy CS 15 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application that could reduce the reasons for refusal, i.e. cycle and refuse storage and  sufficient information was forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - CIL INFORMATIVE \r\nThe applicant is reminded that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Merton Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Merton CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012.
