    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its design, size and siting is considered an unneighbourly form of development which would be visually intrusive, overly dominant and harmful to the amenity of neighbours and would fail to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, density, context, urban layout and landscape features of the surrounding area the detriment of the character of the Camborne Road streetscene, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies CS 13 & CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - \r\nThe proposed one bedroom dwelling by reason of its design, size and layout would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal floorspace standards and external amenity space standards to the detriment of the amenities of future contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing sufficient safe, secure and accessible cycle storage and refuse and recycling facilities contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS17 and CS 18 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Polices Plan 2014.

    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposed development would meet the Council's sustainability policy objectives or comply with adopted emissions reductions targets, contrary to policy 5.3 of the London Plan (2016) and policy CS 15 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of officer concerns regarding the application but chose to have the application determined in order to take it to appeal.  \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
