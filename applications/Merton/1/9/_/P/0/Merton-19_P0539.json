    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion would fail to offer a satisfactory outlook for the rear living area of Flat 2, and adequate usable external amenity area for the occupiers of Flat 1, to the detriment of the environment of future occupiers. This would be contrary to the London Plan (2016) Policy 3.5 and Merton Site's and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM D2.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would raise overlooking concerns to the occupiers of Flat 1 as the access route to Flat 2 would offer direct overlooking into the bedroom and living areas of Flat 1. This would be contrary to Merton Site's and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so as to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 Policy 5.2 and 5.15 and Policy CS 15 of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions, other than to submit a new application, to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
