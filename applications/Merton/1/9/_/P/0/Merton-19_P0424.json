    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the inadequate gross internal floor area, would fail to provide suitable living conditions for prospective occupants. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Merton Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 2011) policy CS14 d(a), London Plan policy 3.5 and Table 3.3 of the London Plan Housing Standards (amended March 2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe following plans were considered with this application: 15500 (PL) 0001, 15500 (PL) 0021, 15500 (PL) 0022, 15500 (PL) 0023, 15500 (PL) 0024 (As Existing and Proposed Maisonette Flat Plans), 15500 (PL) 0024 (As Existing and Proposed Front and Rear Elevations), 15500 (PL) 0016 and15500 (PL) 0026",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of its height, depth, scale and siting, would be an overly dominant and un-neighbourly form of development resulting in visual intrusion and loss of daylight and sunlight to the detriment of the amenities of neighbouring properties, contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
