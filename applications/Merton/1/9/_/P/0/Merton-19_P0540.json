  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting within Morden District Town Centre, proximity to the Morden Regeneration Zone, failure to form part of a larger site, scale and design, is considered an inappropriate form of development that would frustrate Council objectives to regenerate Morden Town Centre and optimise housing output. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2016) policies 3.3 and 3.4, Merton Core Planning Strategy policies CS3 and CS7, and Draft Local Plan (2020) policies H4.2, N3.3 & Tc7.6, which consolidate the objectives of the Mayor of London's housing Zone, which included the designation of Morden in 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - Notwithstanding the preceding reason for refusal, the proposed development, by reason of its siting, design, scale and bulk would appear overly prominent, overbearing and incongruous to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting and design, would result in an unneighbourly form of development to the detriment of neighbouring amenity resulting in of loss of privacy to the first floor residential units at no.12, 14 & 16 Crown Lane, contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policy DMD2.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, design & layout would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation which lacks privacy and fails to meet external private amenity space standards to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, by reason of its design and siting, would require access via an unmade access way to the detriment of the safety and security of future occupiers and the ambulant disabled resulting overall in a poor quality environment for future occupiers. The proposal would be contrary to policies 7.2 and 7.3 of the London Plan (2016), and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development would introduce a noise-sensitive development in close proximity to a noise-generating use without sufficient noise assessments or mitigating measures to safeguard future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy 7.15 of the London Plan (2016) and DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict.
