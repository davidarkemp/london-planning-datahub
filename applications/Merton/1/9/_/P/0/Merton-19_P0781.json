    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed second storey rear extension, by virtue of its bulk, scale, form, design and positioning would result in an obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would detract from the appearance of the host building and be out of keeping with, and detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area.  It is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy CS14 of the Council's adopted Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
