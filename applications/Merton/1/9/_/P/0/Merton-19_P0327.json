    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of design and layout fails to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space arising from a lack of private amenity space, poor outlook, poor levels of natural light, and loss of privacy in the ground floor flats to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers of the flats. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies CS 9 and CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2015 policy 3.5, policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and the London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance 2016.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
