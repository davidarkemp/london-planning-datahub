    "Condition : 1 - Prior to the commencement of the development hereby permitted, a Construction Logistics Plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The approved measures shall be implemented prior to the first occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be so maintained for the duration of the use, unless the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority is first obtained to any variation.",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, height, massing and siting would be an overly bulky and dominant form of development,  resulting in an overdevelopment of the site, failing to respect the Hamilton Road street scene and general pattern of development within the area, contrary to Policies DM D2 (Design Considerations in all developments) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), CS14 (Design) of Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policy 7.4 (Local Character) of the London Plan (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a signed legal agreement, the applicant has failed to secure the agreed affordable housing contribution of �40,000 and details relating to  early and late stage viability reviews contrary to policies DM H3 (support for affordable housing) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), CS8 (Housing Choice) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011), 3.12 (Negotiating Affordable Housing on Individual Private Residential and Mixed Use Schemes) of the London Plan (March 2016), Merton's Development Viability SPD 2018 and the Mayor of London Affordable Housing and Viability SPG 2017.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, located in an area with a PTAL score of 5 (very good), would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a signed legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement (restriction on parking permits only relate to the 1 and 2 bedroom flats), the proposal would be contrary to contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a signed legal agreement, the applicant has failed to secure the free Car Club membership (3 years) for future occupiers of the development, contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T2 (Transport impacts of development), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) and DM T5 (Access to the Road Network) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a signed legal agreement, the applicant has failed to secure the agreed carbon off-set payment of �20,128, contrary to policies CS15 (Climate Change) of Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy 5.2 (Minimising Carbon Dioxide emissions) of the London Plan (2016).",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a signed legal agreement, the applicant has failed to secure the removal the existing crossovers and provision of 2 on-street car parking bays (including that the developer to meets the costs of implementation and requirement for separate S278 highway agreement), contrary to policies DM T2 (Transport impacts of development) and DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 7 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
