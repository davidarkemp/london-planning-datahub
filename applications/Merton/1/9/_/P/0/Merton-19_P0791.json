It is important to note that this written notice doesn't indicate whether or not the proposed development would comply with any of the other limitations or conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A.  If you want confirmation that the proposed development would be lawful (e.g. on the basis that it would comply with all of the limitations and conditions of Schedule 2 Part 1 Class A), then you should submit an (optional) application to the local planning authority for a Lawful Development Certificate (LDC).",
    "Condition : 2 - It is a requirement of the above condition A.4 that the development shall be carried out in accordance with the details approved by the local planning authority, unless the local planning authority and the developer agree otherwise in writing.\r\nIt is a requirement of the above condition A.4 that the development shall be completed on or before 30th May 2016.\r\nIt is a requirement of the above condition A.4 that the developer shall notify the local planning authority of the completion of the development as soon as reasonably practicable after completion, and that this notification shall be in writing and shall include (a) the name of the developer, (b) the address or location of the development, and (c) the date of completion.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to comply with the relevant criteria under Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended) due to the extension exceeding more than half the width of the original house.\r\n"
