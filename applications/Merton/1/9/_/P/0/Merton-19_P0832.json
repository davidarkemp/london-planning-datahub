    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in the loss of a family-sized residential dwelling for which insufficient justification has been given and a need for the proposed health facility has not been demonstrated.  As such, the proposed change of use is considered contrary to Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS14.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed upper level flat would fail to provide access to an area of private external amenity area and refuse facilities which would result in an unsatisfactory standard of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. This would be contrary to the London Plan (2016) Policy 3.5 and 5.17, Merton Site's and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM D2, and Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS17.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so at to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan 2016 Policy 5.2 and 5.15 and Policy CS 15 of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
