    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two bedroom outbuilding by reason of its design and layout would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal floorspace standards to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers and would fail to meet adopted minimum external amenity space standards for the occupiers of both the application and host buildings whilst the proximity of the two buildings would result in unacceptable levels of overlooking and loss of privacy to the detriment of occupier amenity contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing sufficient safe, secure and accessible cycle storage and refuse and recycling facilities contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS17 and CS 18 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Polices Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposed development would meet the Council's sustainability policy objectives or comply with adopted emissions reductions targets, contrary to policy 5.3 of the London Plan (2016) and policy CS 15 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - CIL INFORMATIVE \r\nThe applicant is reminded that Under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended), should an application for appeal be allowed, the proposed development would be deemed as 'chargeable development' and therefore liable to pay the London Borough of Merton Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This would be calculated in accordance with the London Borough of Merton CIL Charging Schedule 2014 and the Mayor of London's CIL Charging Schedule 2012. For more information on CIL matters please visit the web page at: https://www.merton.gov.uk/planning-and-buildings/planning/community-infrastructure-levy",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n \r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
