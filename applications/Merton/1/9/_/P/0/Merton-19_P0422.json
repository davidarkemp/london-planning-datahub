    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor and roof extensions, by reason of its scale, bulk and design would be unduly prominent and intrusive resulting in an incongruous addition to the host dwelling and be detrimental to the visual amenity of neighbouring properties, and character of the host dwelling and surrounding streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 Policies 7.4 & 7.6, Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed conversion would fail to offer adequate provision and access to outdoor amenity areas for the proposed units to the detriment of the environment for future occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to the London Housing SPG, Policy DM D2 of the Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 3 - Provision of refuse and cycle storage facilities positioned on the first floor rear roof terrace are considered inadequate for collection, inconvenient for access and would fail to meet cycle parking standards, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers and failing to promote more sustainable forms of travel. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 Policies 5.17 and 6.9, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM T3 and Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policies CS17, CS18 and CS20.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so at to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan 2016 Policy 5.2 and 5.15 and Policy CS 15 of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
