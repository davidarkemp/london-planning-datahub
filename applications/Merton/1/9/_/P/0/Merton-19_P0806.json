    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, form and appearance, would result in an overly dominant and incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its form, scale, bulk and siting, is considered to be an overly dominant and un-neighbourly form of development resulting in visual intrusion to the detriment of the amenities of the neighbouring property at 21 Biggin Avenue, contrary to policies 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n"
