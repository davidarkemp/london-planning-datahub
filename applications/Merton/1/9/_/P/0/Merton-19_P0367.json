    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension due to its design, height, siting, massing and bulk would result in an overly dominant, visually intrusive, incongruous and inappropriate form of development, unsympathetic to and harmful to the appearance of the existing building and general pattern of development in the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DM D2 Design considerations in all developments of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan, DM D3 Alterations to existing buildings and  CS 14 (Design) of Merton's Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would result in one additional residential unit, the site is located in a controlled parking zone, has reasonable access to public transport and there is no legal agreement in place for the unit to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS.20 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011, and policy DM T2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
