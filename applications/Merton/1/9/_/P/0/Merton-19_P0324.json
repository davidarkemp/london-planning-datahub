    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, by virtue of its form, bulk and massing would result in material harm to the character of the host building and surrounding area, contrary to Policy CS14 of the Council's adopted Core Planning Strategy 2011, and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed extension, by virtue of its rear projection and proximity to the boundary, would result in an unreasonable sense of enclosure and overbearing form causing material harm to the occupiers No.14 Haydon Park Road, contrary to Policy CS14 of the Council's adopted Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Council's adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
