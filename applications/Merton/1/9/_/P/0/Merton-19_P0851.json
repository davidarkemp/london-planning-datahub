  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of the size, design and layout would result in the provision of an unsatisfactory and cramped standard of accommodation for future occupiers failing to meet minimum floorspace standards and detrimental to the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), the DCLG Technical Housing Standards (nationally described space standards) (2015) and the London Housing SPG 2016.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of the location of the garden to flat B, accessible via an unlit service road off Kingsmead Avenue, would fail to provide a layout that is of the highest quality externally, or achieves the highest standard of accessible and inclusive design, or is safe and secure and takes account of crime prevention to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would fail to meet the objectives of policy 3.5, 7.2 and 7.3 of the London Plan (2016), and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposed development would meet the Council's sustainability policy objectives or comply with adopted emissions reductions targets, contrary to policy 5.3 of the London Plan (2016) and policy CS 15 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
