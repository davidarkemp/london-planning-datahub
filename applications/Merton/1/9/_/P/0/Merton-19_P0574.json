    "Reason : 1 - The proposed three storey rear extension by virtue of its bulk, scale and massing is an incongruous addition which would result in material harm to the character and pattern of development in the surrounding area including the streetscene of Hamilton Road Mews and Hamilton Road.  It is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy CS14 of the Council's adopted Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension, due to its scale, form, depth and design, would cause material harm to the amenity of the occupiers of the first floor flats either side of the site by reason of dominance, loss of light and outlook.  This is contrary to Policy CS14 of the Council's adopted Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Council's adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed extension and residential units created, by virtue of their design, with poor outlook, will not form quality residential development.  This is contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
