    "Condition : 1 - The operations comprising the erection of a two storey rear extension would consist of the enlargement of a dwelling house within the meaning of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class A. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 2 - The operations comprising the erection of a hip to gable and rear roof dormer extension would consist of the enlargement of a dwelling house within the meaning of Class B of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class B. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 3 - The operations comprising the installation of three roof lights in the front roof slope would consist of any other alteration to the roof of the dwelling house within the meaning of Class C of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class C. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 4 - Reliance on permitted development rights is dependent on the sequence of construction of extensions if parts of one extension, deemed to be permitted, are common to parts of other extensions that on their own may also be deemed to be permitted. By constructing the two storey rear extension subject of this application, or one of similar size and design, it would not be possible to rely on development rights to erect the single storey rear extension granted under prior approval (19/P0545) (or any single storey extension with a depth of more than 3m).
