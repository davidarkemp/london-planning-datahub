    "Reason : 1 - The single storey extension by reason of its size and siting is considered an unneighbourly form of development which is visually intrusive, overly dominant and harmful to the amenity of neighbours due to overshadowing and the loss of sunlight and daylight contrary to the principles of policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The single storey extension by reason of its design, bulk and siting fails to respect the appearance, scale, bulk, proportions and character of the original building and its surroundings, contrary to the principles of policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
