    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the loss of a family sized dwelling and would not incorporate re-provision of a family sized unit, adversely affecting the existing stock of 3 bedroom units in the borough, contrary to Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the lack of car parking to serve the proposed dwellings in a low PTAL area, would result in an increased demand for off-site car parking, leading to an increase in indiscriminate parking occurring in the surrounding area, which would have an adverse impact on highway safety, contrary to Policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM T2 and DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposed development would meet the Council's sustainability policy objectives or comply with adopted emissions reductions targets, contrary to policy 5.3 of the London Plan (2016) and policy CS 15 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
