    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application but wished to allow the application to be determined in order to take it to appeal. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent again did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, size and massing, coupled with its location on a prominent corner site,  would result in an incongruous, overly-dominant and unneighbourly form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and would detract from the visual amenities of the Cannon Hill Lane/Camborne Road streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.6, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS14 and Merton SPP policies DMD2 and DMD3."
