    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Site location plan and drawings 10165/02/19, 10165/03/19 and 735F/01 Rev A,",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied at any time other than for purposes ancillary to the residential use of the dwelling known as 4 Preshaw Crescent",
    "Condition : 5 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\ni) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\nii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - For the avoidance of doubt a purpose incidental to a house would not cover normal residential uses, such as separate self-contained accommodation nor the use of an outbuilding for primary living accommodation such as a bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen. In other words, if the use of a space is fundamental to the ordinary day-to-day functioning of the dwelling it would not be incidental but part of the primary accommodation. The letting or full time residential use of the building hereby approved as a self-contained unit on either a permanent, semi-permanent or rental basis would constitute a change of use that may be subject to a requirement for planning permission.
