    "Reason : 1 - 1. The height of the proposal would exceed 3m in eaves height and is located within 2m of the boundary. In addition, it would have a raised rear terrace that exceeds 300mm in height. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is therefore not compliant with the criteria set out under Class A in the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\n2. The proposal, by reason of its height, depth and siting on both adjoining boundaries would cause material harm to the amenities of neighbouring properties 317 and 321 Durnsford Road.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is therefore not compliant with the criteria set out under Class A in the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
