    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to provide a plan accurately indicating the site and proposed development. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (2)(b) & (3)(b) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
