    "Reason : 1 - The proposed one bedroom dwellings, by reason of their design, size, siting and layout would result in a cramped internal layout with outdoor amenity space that would fail to meet minimum space standards or be likely to achieve adequate privacy for future occupiers and would result in an unsatisfactory environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2011), CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy HS.1 of the Merton Unitary Development Plan (2003).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of its design, bulk, size and siting, would be an incongruous and cramped form of development that would fail to achieve a high standard of design that would respond to, complement or reinforce the character and local distinctiveness of the adjoining townscape to the detriment of the visual amenities of the Runnymede streetscene and would give rise to overlooking of neighbouring dwellings to the rear in Liberty Avenue. The proposals would be contrary to policies CS.14 of the Council's Adopted Core Strategy (2011) and BE.16 and BE.22 of the Merton Unitary Development Plan (2003).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed one bedroom dwellings fail to contribute to meeting affordable housing targets in the borough and, in the absence of a legal undertaking securing a financial contribution towards the delivery of affordable housing off-site, would be contrary to policy CS.8 of the Adopted Merton Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by: Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome. As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application. In this instance: The application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF. It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions. The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
