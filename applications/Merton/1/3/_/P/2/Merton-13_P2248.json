    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey house by reason of its size, design and siting would be unduly dominant and visually intrusive and be out of keeping with the design and character of the local area, detracting from the existing suburban character and sense of openness at the junction of Glastonbury Road and Goldcliff Close and would be harmful to the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers and the streetscene; contrary to policies BE.16 and BE.23 of the Merton UDP (2003) and CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would fail to contribute to meeting affordable housing targets in the borough and, in the absence of a legal undertaking securing a financial contribution towards the delivery of affordable housing off-site, would be contrary to policy CS.8 of the Adopted Merton Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - \r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
