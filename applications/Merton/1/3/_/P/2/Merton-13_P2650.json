    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in the addition of a three storey side extension to 3 Thornton Hill, which would appear as an excessively large and overbearing addition, and the loss of original features of the existing property, a dwelling noted as making a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the Wimbledon West Conservation Area, through the proposed conversion/modernisation works.  As such, the proposed development would be contrary to policies BE.1, BE.15, and BE.23 of the London Borough of Merton UDP - 2003, and policy CS14 of the London Borough of Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new dwelling, by virtue of its scale, massing, and proximity to the boundary with 1 Thornton Hill would comprise an excessively cramped and overbearing form of development detriment of the outlook of 1 Thornton Hill and out of character with the pattern of development within the Wimbledon West Conservation Area.    As such, the proposed development is contrary to policies HS.1, BE.1, BE.15, and BE.22 of the London Borough of Merton UDP - 2003, policy CS 14 of the London Borough of Merton Core Strategy - 2011, and the Council's New Residential Extensions SPG.",
    "Reason : 3 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
