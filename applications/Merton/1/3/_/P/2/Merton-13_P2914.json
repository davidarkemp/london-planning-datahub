    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its sitting, layout and design would represent a form of development that would a) fail to relate positively to the urban layout of the surrounding area and b) fail to provide a safe and secure layout with good levels of natural surveillance contrary to policies, 7.3 and 7.4 of the London Plan 2015, DM D1 and DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies CS 9 and CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its sitting, layout and design would represent a form of development that would fail to provide sufficient private outdoor amenity space and would result in a loss of privacy and low levels of natural light and outlook such that the proposals would have a harmful impact on the amenity of future occupiers of the development, contrary to policies, 3.5 of the London Plan 2015, DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies CS 9 and CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed siting, design and method of construction of Block C would not have a negative impact on the integrity of the River Graveney culvert or that the new development on top of that culvert would not preclude access for any future renewal/upgrade over the life time of the development which would put new residents at risk of flooding if the culvert should collapse, contrary to policies CS 16 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM F1 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\n\n",
    "Reason : 4 - \n\nNote to Applicant\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\nIn this instance:\n\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\n"
