  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions by reason of design, materials, size, bulk and massing, are considered to be an incongruous and overly dominant form of development that fails to respect and complement the original building and its surroundings or to be sympathetic to the form, scale, bulk and proportions of the original building and the wider setting of Wolsey Crescent. The proposals are considered to be visually intrusive and would lead to an unacceptable loss of privacy harmful to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The propsoals would be contrary to policies BE.15, BE.16, BE 23 and BE.24 of the Merton UDP 2003 and CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 2 - Note to Applicant: In accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\nOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome. As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application. In this instance: The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.  It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions. The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\n"
