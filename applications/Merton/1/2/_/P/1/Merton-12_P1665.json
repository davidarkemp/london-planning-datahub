    "Reason : 1 - The proposed larger outbuilding, by reason of being within 2m of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and exceeding 2.5m height, would exceed the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No 2) (England) Order 2008. Planning permission would therefore be required.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed new buildings exceed what may be reasonably considered as incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse.The floorspace of the two buildings would be much larger than the house itself, even including the upper floor. Although the activities designated on the plans of the new buildings fall into categories that, individually, may be acceptable as incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house, taken together they occupy an unreasonable amount of space and as a matter of fact and degree it is considered that the proposals do not come within the terms of Class E of Part 1 of GPDO."
