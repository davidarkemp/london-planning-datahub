    "Reason : 1 - The proposed new buildings exceed what may be reasonably considered as incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse. The floorspace of the two buildings would be much larger than the house itself, even including the upper floor. Although the activities designated on the plans of the new buildings fall into categories that, individually, may be acceptable as incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse, taken together they occupy an unreasonable amount of space and, as a matter of fact and degree, it is considered that the proposals do not fall within the terms of Class E, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the GPDO (as amended)."
