    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey house by reason of its size, design and siting would: a)\tresult in the provision of cramped accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal floorspace standards resulting in an unsatisfactory environment for future occupiers; b) be unduly dominant and visually intrusive and be out of keeping with the design and character of the local area, detracting from the existing suburban character and sense of openness at the junction of Glastonbury Road and Goldcliff Close and would be harmful to the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers and the streetscene; contrary to policies 3.5 of the London Plan (2011), BE.15 BE.16 and BE.23 of the Merton UDP (2003) and CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would fail to contribute to meeting affordable housing targets in the borough and, in the absence of a legal undertaking securing a financial contribution towards the delivery of affordable housing off-site, would be contrary to policy CS.8 of the Adopted Merton Core Strategy (2011)."
