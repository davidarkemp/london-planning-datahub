    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of residential accommodation in terms of the absence of any external amenity space for the occupiers of the family accommodation on the upper floors contrary to policy HS1 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan 2003and policy CS 14 of the LDF Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of it's design, siting, height, bulk and massing, would result in an unduly prominent and unneighbourly form of development, which would fail to respond to, or reinforce, the locally distinctive pattern of development and by removing this important visual break with a building extending past the front elevation of 1 Eveline Road it would represent an incongruous form of development which would be visually intrusive to neighbouring occupiers contrary to UDP policies BE 15 and BE 22.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development fails to contribute towards affordable housing for which there is a defined need and in the absence of a legal undertaking securing a financial contribution towards the delivery of affordable provision off-site, the proposal is contrary to policy CS.8 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).\r\n"
