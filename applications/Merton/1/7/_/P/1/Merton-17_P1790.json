    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its design, appearance, siting, bulk and massing would constitute incongruous development that would be wholly out of keeping with the prevalent development and urban grain of the area, which is considered to be detrimental to the character and appearance of the area as a whole. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy 2011 policy CS14 and of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - \n\nNote to Applicant\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\nIn this instance:\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its sitting, height, bulk and massing, would be an overly dominant and un-neighbourly form of development resulting in visual intrusion to the detriment of the amenities of neighbouring properties, contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of its lack of outlook, would fail to provide adequate living conditions for prospective occupants, contrary to policy DMD2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and the London Housing SPG 2016."
