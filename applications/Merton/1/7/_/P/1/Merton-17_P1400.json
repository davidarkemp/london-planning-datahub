    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of the poor lighting, landscaping, existing commercial activity, and the narrow nature, design and distances of the accesses from Wellington Works and Dawlish Avenue, the proposal would fail to provide a safe and secure environment for pedestrians, cyclists and emergency vehicles contrary to policies of DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments), DM T2 (Transport impacts of development), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, car club membership and a travel plan, the proposal would be contrary to policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development could generate a surplus in profit in the future, in the absence of a legal agreement securing a viability review, the proposal would be contrary to policies DM H3 (support for affordable housing) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), CS8 (Housing Choice) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and 3.12 (Negotiating Affordable Housing on Individual Private Residential and Mixed Use Schemes) of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would fail to adequately secure improvements to permeability in the area including the Wandle Trail, Durnsford Road Recreational Ground and safeguarding links with Rufus Business Park, and in the absence of a legal agreement, the development would be contrary to policies of DM D1 (Urban design and the public realm), DM O1 (Open space), DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments) and DM T2 (Transport impacts of development) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS13 (Open space, nature conservation, leisure and culture) and CS14 (Design) of Merton's the Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 5 - Note to Applicant\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\nIn this instance:\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \n"
