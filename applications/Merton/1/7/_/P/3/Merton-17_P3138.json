    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would replace an open area of garden space, with an enlarged plant hire yard in proximity to the boundaries of the rear gardens of neighbouring houses and would be likely to be visually intrusive and detrimental to the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would be contrary to policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the enlargement of the operation of the plant hire yard, and its increased proximity to the boundaries of the rear gardens of neighbouring houses, has the potential to be a source of noise and disturbance to the detriment of the amenities of neighbouring residential occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2016) policies 7.15 and Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM.D2 and DM.EP2..",
    "Reason : 3 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
