    "Condition : 22 - Piling or any other foundation designs using penetrative methods shall not be permitted other than with the express written consent of the Local Planning Authority, which may be given for those parts of the site where it has been demonstrated that there is no resultant unacceptable risk to groundwater. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details. \r\n\r\nReason: In order to protect controlled waters and the health of future occupiers of the site and adjoining areas in accordance with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy 5.21 of the London Plan 2015 and policy DM EP4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Condition : 23 - The details and measures recommended/proposed in the 'Preliminary Ecological Appraisal' dated October 2017, 'Bat Survey' dated October 2017 and 'Reptile Survey' dated October 2017 shall be implemented in accordance with, and follow the sequence of events in, the documents, with all details and measures to be implemented prior to the first occupation of the development. \r\n\r\nReason: To mitigate and offset the impact of the development and to ensure a net gain in biodiversity and improvements to the amenity in the area, in accordance with NPPF section 11, London Plan policies 7.5, 7.19 and 7.21 CS policy CS13 and SPP policies DM D2, DM O1 and DM O2.\r\n",
    "Condition : 24 - a) INFORMATIVE: In accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the National Planning Policy Framework, The London Borough of Merton takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. The London Borough of Merton works with applicants or agents in a positive and proactive manner by suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome; and updating applicants or agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application. In this instance the Planning Committee considered the application where the applicant or agent had the opportunity to speak to the committee and promote the application.",
    "Condition : 25 - b) INFORMATIVE: The applicant is advised that the demolition and tree felling works should avoid the bird nesting and bat roosting season. This avoids disturbing birds and bats during a critical period and will assist in preventing possible contravention of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which seeks to protect nesting birds/bats and their nests/roosts. Buildings should be also be inspected for bird nests and bat roosts prior to demolition. All species of bat in Britain and their roosts are afforded special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside act 1981. If bats are found, Natural England should be contacted for advice (telephone: 020 7831 6922).",
    "Condition : 26 - c) INFORMATIVE: No surface water runoff should discharge onto the public highway including the public footway or highway. When it is proposed to connect to a public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.   Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).",
    "Condition : 27 - d) INFORMATIVE: Carbon emissions evidence requirements for Post Construction stage assessments must provide:\r\n-\tDetailed documentary evidence confirming the Target Emission Rate (TER), Dwelling Emission Rate (DER) and percentage improvement of DER over TER based on 'As Built' SAP outputs (i.e. dated outputs with accredited energy assessor name and registration number, assessment status, plot number and development address); OR, where applicable:\r\n-\tA copy of revised/final calculations as detailed in the assessment methodology based on 'As Built' SAP outputs; AND\r\n-\tConfirmation of Fabric Energy Efficiency (FEE) performance where SAP section 16 allowances (i.e. CO2 emissions associated with appliances and cooking, and site-wide electricity generation technologies) have been included in the calculation\r\n",
    "Condition : 28 - e) INFORMATIVE: Water efficiency evidence requirements for Post Construction Stage assessments must provide: \r\n-\tDetailed documentary evidence representing the dwellings 'As Built'; showing: \r\n- \tthe location, details and type of appliances/ fittings that use water in the dwelling (including any specific water reduction equipment with the capacity / flow rate of equipment); and \r\n- \tthe location, size and details of any rainwater and grey-water collection systems provided for use in the dwelling; along with one of the following:\r\n-\tWater Efficiency Calculator for New Dwellings; or\r\n-\tWritten confirmation from the developer that the appliances/fittings have been installed, as specified in the design stage detailed documentary evidence; or\r\n-\tWhere different from design stage, provide revised Water Efficiency Calculator for New Dwellings and detailed documentary evidence (as listed above) representing the dwellings 'As Built'\r\n",
    "Condition : 29 - f) INFORMATIVE: Under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016, an application for a Flood Risk Activity Permit (FRAP) must be submitted to the Environment Agency if works are proposed: \r\n-\tIn, over or under a main river \r\n-\tWithin 8m of the bank of a main river, \r\n-\tWithin 8m of any flood defence structure or culvert on a main river, Flood risk activities can be classified as: Exclusions, Exemptions, Standard Rules or Bespoke. These are associated with the level of risk your proposed works may pose to people, property and the environment. \r\n\r\nThe developer should apply for a Bespoke FRAP if the works cannot be classified as one of the following: \r\n-\tan excluded activity \r\n-\tan 'exempt' activity \r\n-\ta 'standard rules' activity\r\n"
