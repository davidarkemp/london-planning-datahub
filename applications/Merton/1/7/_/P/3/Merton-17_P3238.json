    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, layout and siting, would fail to provide a suitable standard of accommodation for future occupiers arising from a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of internal living space, poor quality external amenity space and poor outlook that would be detrimental to the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to policies CS 9 & CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016, the London Plan Housing SPG (2016) and the DCLG's Technical housing standards-nationally described space standards (2015).",
    "Reason : 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n"
