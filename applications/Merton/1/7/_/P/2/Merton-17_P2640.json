  "description": "ERECTION OF A REAR ROOF EXTENSION WITH JULIETTE BALCONY AND 3 X ROOFLIGHTS TO THE FRONT ROOF SLOPE \n",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - \n\nNote to Applicant\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\nIn this instance:\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The construction of the proposed rear roof extension to 11 Manor Gardens by reason of the design, form, bulk and appearance would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, thereby detracting from the visual amenities and fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of Manor Gardens and the John Innes Merton Park Conservation Area, contrary to Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14, and Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014 - policies DM D3 and DM D4.\n"
