    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its excessive height, massing and design would have a detrimental impact on the streetscene when viewed from Prince's Road and surrounding streets and would fail to preserve or enhance the setting of the adjoining Merton (South Park Gardens) Conservation Area contrary to Policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in two additional residential units, the site is located in a controlled parking zone, has excellent links to public transport and there is no legal agreement in place for the units to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.
