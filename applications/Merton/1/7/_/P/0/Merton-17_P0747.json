    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, layout and siting, would fail to provide a suitable standard of accommodation for future occupiers arising from a substandard provision of natural lighting and a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of external amenity space that would not meet the needs of the size of household likely to occupy the unit with a garden that would be significantly smaller than the Council's adopted minimum garden space standards; Contrary to policies CS 9 & CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014,.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its size, siting and design would represent a visually intrusive and unneighbourly form of development that would result in a loss of outlook, privacy and daylight to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring occupiers; Contrary to policy 7.4 of the London Plan 2015, DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its size, siting and design would represent a visually intrusive and overly dominant form of development that would fail to enhance the character of the area and would constitute an development that would be to the detriment of the character and suburban nature of the Gore Road/Approach Road streetscene,  contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, DM D2 & DM D3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
