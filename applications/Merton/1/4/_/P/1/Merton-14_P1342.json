  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, size and siting,  would result in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation for future occupiers, would fail to provide private amenity space that would meet the needs of the size of household that may reasonably occupy the houses, would be unduly dominant and visually prominent failing to relate positively and appropriately to the massing of surrounding buildings and the existing street pattern, including spaces between buildings, and would be visually intrusive and result in overshadowing, loss of outlook and loss of privacy to the detriment of the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.  The proposals would be contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011), policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM.D2 and DM.D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014), and the Mayor of London's Housing SPG (November 2012).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would increase demand for parking space within a Controlled Parking Zone that is subject to high demand for parking and would be likely to exacerbate parking pressure and in the absence of a legal undertaking securing a permit free development would be contrary to policy CS.20 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by: Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome. As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application. In this instance: The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan as submitted. The applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but no revisied plans were submitted. The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
