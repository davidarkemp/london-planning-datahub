    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its siting and site coverage, constitutes a cramped form of development resulting in detriment on the visual amenities of the Courtney Road streetscene, would constitute a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development which would result in a sense of enclosure and a loss of outlook to the detriment of the amenities of neighbouring occupiers and would comprise a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2011, policies CS8 and CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Strategy 2011 and policies DM.D1 and DM.D2 of the Merton LDF Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - \r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance: \r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
