    "Reason : 1 - The proposals would result in the loss of employment land, for which the applicant has failed to demonstrate that there is no demand, or that it is unsuitable or financially unviable for any employment or community use, to the detriment of safeguarding employment opportunities in the Borough, and would be contrary to policy DM E3 of the Sites and Policies Document (2014) and the wider objectives of policy 4.4 of the London Plan (2011). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed bungalow by reason of its design and siting would result in a development that provided future occupiers with poor outlook and a layout that that failed to take account of crime prevention and would be contrary to policies policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Document (2014)",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would fail to contribute to meeting affordable housing targets and in the absence of a legal undertaking securing a financial contribution towards the delivery of affordable housing off-site would be contrary to policy CS.8 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict.
