    "Reason : 1 - The proposed bungalow, by reason of its size and siting in addition to the site coverage of the extended house at123 Monkleigh Road, and its position relative to the existing dwelling, would result in an overly intense development of the site, where a more spacious pattern of development characterises this suburban location to the detriment of the local character and streetscene, and result in a poor external environment for future occupiers arising from overlooking and the potential for noise and disturbance from the comings and goings of neighbouring occupiers accessing adjoining parts of the proposed irregular shaped residual garden. The proposals would be contrary to policy CS.9 & CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies HS.1, BE15, BE16 and BE22 of the Merton Unitary Development Plan (2003)."
