    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, appearance, proportions, bulk and massing would fail to respect the character of the Dorien Road street scene and would represent an overbearing and visually intrusive feature when viewed from neighbouring properties and their rear gardens contrary to policies BE.15 [New buildings and extensions; daylight; sunlight; privacy; visual intrusion and noise]; BE16 [Urban design]; and BE22 [Design of new development] of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan [October 2003] policies 3.5 [Quality and design of housing developments and 7.6 [Architecture] of the London Plan and policy CS14 [Design] of the Adopted Core Strategy [July 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of poor internal layout and external amenity space provision would fail to provide an adequate standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers contrary to policies HS1 [Housing layout and amenity]; BE16 [Urban design]; and BE22 [Design of new development] of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan [October 2003] policies 3.5 [Quality and design of housing developments of the London Plan and policy CS14 [Design] of the Adopted Core Strategy [July 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would increase the demand for on-street parking and servicing in the area and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that additional vehicles likely to be generated by the development can be accommodated on the road network without compromising highway safety and efficiency contrary to Policy CS20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of the Adopted Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on educational and open space facilities in the area. In the absence of a legal undertaking securing a financial contribution toward education provision and open space improvements locally to offset the impact of the proposals within these identified areas, the proposals would be contrary to policies C.13, L.8 and L.9 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (October 2003) and Supplementary Planning Guidance: Planning Obligations (2006).",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development would fail to contribute to meeting affordable housing targets and in the absence of a legal undertaking securing a financial contribution towards the delivery of affordable housing off-site would be contrary to policy CS.8 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011)."
