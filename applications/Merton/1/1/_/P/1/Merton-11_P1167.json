    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would be of insufficient design quality for this prominent town centre location and would by reason of its design, height and siting have an unsatisfactory relationship the the adjoining building at 143-151 The Broadway (known as CIPD House) and would be contrary to retained UDP policies BE.16 (Urban Design) and BE.22 (Design of New Development) and Adopted Core Strategy policy CS14 (Design).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The bulk, massing and site coverage of the propsed rear extension would result in an unneighbourly form of development that would be visually intrusive to occupiers of neighbouring residential properties in Griffith's Road contrary to retained UDP policy BE.15 (New Buildings and Extensions; Daylight, Sunlight, Privacy, Visual Intrusion and Noise).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed hotel fails to take a suitably comprehensive approach to the development of this important town centre site and compromises the future redevelopment of the adjacent designated development site 4WTC on the adopted UDP Proposals Map and is contrary to Policies CS6(e) - Wimbledon Town Centre, CS7- Centres and CS14(iii) of the adopted Core Strategy (July 2011) and the principles of good planning."
