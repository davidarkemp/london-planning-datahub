    "Reason : 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\nOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\nWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\nAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\nThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\nThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of their design and siting would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal and external floorspace standards to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers and would be contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.
