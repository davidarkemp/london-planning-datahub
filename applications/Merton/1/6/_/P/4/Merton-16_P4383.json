    "Reason : 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\nOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\nWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\nAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\nThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\nIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\nThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
