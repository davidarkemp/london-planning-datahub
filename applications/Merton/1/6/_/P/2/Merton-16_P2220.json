    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its design, layout and siting would result in an unacceptable level of overlooking and loss of privacy which would have an unduly adverse impact on the residential amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties and future occupiers of the application property.  This would be contrary to policies DMD2 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS11 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015 and the adopted SPG 'New Residential Development'.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal results in a substandard level of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers by reason of its layout providing poor outlook and daylighting to the main living areas, the bedroom failing to meet the minimum internal floorspace standards and the lack of private outdoor amenity space. This would be contrary to policies DMD2 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS9 and CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015 and the London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance 2016.",
    "Reason : 3 - \r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal provides no cycle parking contrary to policies DMT1 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS18 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 6.9 of the London Plan 2015.",
    "Reason : 5 - The propsal provides no space for the storage of refuse and recycling contrary to policies DMD2 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS17 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 5.17 of the London Plan 2015",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a binding legal agreement which would restrict future occupiers of the proposed residential units from obtaining parking permits in controlled parking zones which operates within the locality, the development would have a detrimental impact on parking stress within the locality.  The development would therefore be contrary to policies DMT2 of Adopted SPP 2014, CS20 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and Policy 6.13 of the London Plan."
