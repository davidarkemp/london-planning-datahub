    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, size and siting, would fail to provide private amenity space that would meet the needs of the size of household that may reasonably occupy the house, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed house by reason of its size and design would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal floorspace, room size and ceiling height standards to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011, policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Technical housing standards-nationally described space standards 2015 .",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of the design and layout of the accommodation including proximity of windows to basement walls and boundary fencing will fail to provide an adequate standard of living accommodation with poor levels of outlook and natural light provided for future occupants contrary to policies DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan and CS14 of the Core Strategy. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - \r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
