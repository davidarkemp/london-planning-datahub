    "Reason : 1 - \r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 186 and 187 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\t\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of their design would result in a substandard environment for future occupiers with the provision of internal floor areas significantly less than London Plan space standards with poor levels of natural light and poor outlook and a failure to provide adequate secure cycle storage. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2015) policies 3.5 & 6.9, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) policies CS 9, CS 14 and CS 18 and Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
