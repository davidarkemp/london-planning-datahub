    "Condition : 2 - Any advertisement displayed and any site used for the display of advertisements shall be maintained in a clean and tidy condition to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 3 - Where an advertisement is required under these regulations to be removed, the removal shall be carried out to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - No advertisement shall be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.",
    "Condition : 5 - No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to obscure or hinder the ready interpretation of any road traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or so as otherwise to render hazardous the use of any highway, railway, waterway (including any coastal waters) or aerodrome (civil or military).",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed illuminated projecting sign, due to its design, size and siting would be an obtrusive form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and the subject building, contrary to policy EB.31 of the Adopted Merton Unitary Development Plan (April 1996) and policy BE.47 of the Second Deposit Draft Unitary Development Plan (October 2000)."
