  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of 3 years, beginning with the date of this permission. ",
    "Condition : 2 - The facing materials to be used for the external surfaces of the building hereby approved shall be those specified in the approved drawing 020 A unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 3 - Details of those parts of the site not covered by buildings including any parking, service roads, sight lines, footpaths, hard and soft landscaping, surface treatment and boundary treatment shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any development hereby permitted commences. These works shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Condition : 4 - Details of proposals for the storage of refuse shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of development and shall be in place prior to the occupation of the buildings/commencement of use hereby approved and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Condition : 5 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning General Permitted Development Order 1995 (or any other Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no buildings, extensions, or alterations permitted by Classes A, B, C, D and E of Part 1 of Schedule 2 in the 1995 Order shall be carried out without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority. ",
    "Condition : 6 - Details of the proposed slab levels of the building and existing site levels shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before work commences and the development shall be completed strictly in accordance with the approved levels and details.",
    "Condition : 7 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning General Permitted Development Order 1995 (or any other Order revoking or re-enacting this Order with or without modification) no windows or other openings other than those authorised as part of the development hereby approved shall be formed in the flank elevation of the building without the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 8 - No demolition or construction work in connection with this permission shall be carried out outside the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 on Mondays to Fridays inclusive, 08.00 to 13.00 on Saturdays and there shall be no such work carried out on Sundays or Public Holidays.",
    "Condition : 9 - The development  hereby approved shall not commence on site until such time as the existing two storey side extension at 123 Monkleigh Road has been demolished.\r\nReason: The Council considers that the retention of the existing side extension would, were the new dwelling to be built, result in the loss of a significant visual break within the streetscene to the detriment of visual amenity. The Council therefore wishes to safeguard the visual amenities of the Monkleigh Road streetscene by ensuring the removal of the extension.",
    "Condition : 10 - REASON FOR APPROVAL.\r\nThe proposal involves satisfactory design and would increase housing stock in the Borough. The scheme would not have a harmful impact on neighbour or visual amenity and accords with the Council's Adopted Unitary Development Plan and London Plan Policies. The policies listed below were relevant to the determination of this proposal.\r\nMerton Unitary Development Plan (2003)\r\nBE15 New Buildings and Extensions\r\nBE16 Urban Design, \r\nBE22 Design of New Development\r\nBE23 Alterations and Extensions to Buildings\r\nHS1 Housing Layout and Amenity\r\nHP1 Housing Targets\r\nHP4 Density of Developmnt\r\nPK2 Car parking Standards \r\n\r\n"
