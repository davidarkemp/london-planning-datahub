The proposal therefore meets with the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (October 2003) and London Plan policies. The policies listed below were relevant to the determination of this proposal:\r\nBE.15: New Buildings and Extensions; Daylight, Sunlight, Privacy, Visual Intrusion and Noise \r\nBE.16: Urban Design \r\nBE.22: Design of New Development\r\nBE.23: Alterations and Extensions to Buildings \r\nBE.24: Roof Extensions and Dormer Windows \r\n\r\n\r\n"
