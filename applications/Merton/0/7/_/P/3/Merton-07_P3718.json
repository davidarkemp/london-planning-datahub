    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions, by reason of design, size, bulk and siting, would result in unduly prominent and incongruous additions to the host dwelling and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the Midmoor Road street scene as well as the host dwelling and would be contrary to policies BE.23 and BE.24 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (October 2003).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed flats and the related two storey extension by reason of their size, design and layout, would provide a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of residential accommodation which would fail to meet the likely needs of future occupiers, and which as a result of their closer proximity to the railway and proposed first floor roof terrace would result in potential noise disturbance, detrimental to the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policy HS.1 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (October 2003) and the Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance \"Residential Conversions, Alterations and Extensions\" (2001)"
