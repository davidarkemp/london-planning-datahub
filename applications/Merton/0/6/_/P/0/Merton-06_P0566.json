    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of bulk, design, size and siting would appear as an inappropriate and intrusive form of development, resulting in;\r\na)  the loss of an important visual break, detrimental to the Cavendish Avenue streetscene, contrary to policies BE16, BE22, BE23 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan 2003;\r\nb) a poor and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation for future occupiers, with inadequate amenity space to meet their likely needs, contrary to policies HS.1and BE.15 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan 2003;\r\nc) a failure to provide a safe and secure layout for vehicle movements and access contrary to policy HS.1, BE.15 PK.2 and PK.3 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan 2003.\r\n ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its location within a 1:100 year floodplain would impede the flow of floodwater and reduce the capacity of the floodplain to store water, consequently increasing the risk of flooding elsewhere and increasing the number of people at risk from flooding by introducing additional households into the floodplain, contrary to policies ST.23 and PE.5 of the Adopted Unitary Developemnt Plan 2003.
