The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE:  You are advised that the size of the proposed roof extensions is very close to the maximum allowed as 'permitted development'. You should therefore ensure that the extensions are built no larger than shown on the approved drawings. You are further advised that this certificate is issued on the understanding that the party walls of the house are not to be raised. If the party walls were to be built up, planning permission would be required."
