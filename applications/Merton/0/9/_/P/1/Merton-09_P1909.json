    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of their design, siting, height, bulk and massing, would result in an unduly prominent and unneighbourly form of development, which would:\r\n\r\na) fail to respond to or reinforce the locally distinctive pattern of development within the area resulting in a building that would be unduly visually intrusive to neighbouring occupants,\r\nb) result in an undue loss of privacy to the rear gardens of the 35 and 33 Florence Avenue,\r\nand would be contrary to policies BE.15, BE.16 and BE.22 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (2003) and the Adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance Notes: New Residential Development (1999).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on educational facilities, public open spaces and children's play spaces in the area. In the absence of a legal agreement securing a financial contribution toward education provision, the upgrade of local public open space and children's play spaces and the costs of monitoring the S106 obligations, the proposal would fail to offset this impact, and would be contrary to policies C.13, L.8 & L.9 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (October 2003) and the Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance: Planning Obligations (2006)."
