If the developer wishes to undertake this work the Council will require a deposit and the developer will need to cover all the Council's costs (including supervision of the works). If the works are of a significant nature, a Section 278 Agreement (Highways Act 1980) will be required and the works must be carried out to the Council's specification.",
    "Condition : 6 - REASON FOR APPROVAL.\r\nThe described develoment involves appropriate design and would not unduly impact on neighbour amenity. It accords with the Council's Adopted Unitary Development Plan, Supplmentary planning Guidance Notes and London Plan Policies.
