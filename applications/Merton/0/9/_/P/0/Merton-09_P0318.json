    "Reason : 1 - The proposals, by reason of their bulk, massing, design and layout:\r\na) Would constitute an unduly dominant and inconguous extension to the existing terrace, harmful to the visual amenities of the Grove Road streetscene and the surrounding area:\r\nb)  Would result in a cramped form of accommodation and an unsatisfactory environment for future occupiers of both the enlarged and the proposed flats, arising from substandard internal accommodation and an absence of garden space to meet the likely needs of future occupiers.\r\nThe proposals are therefore contrary to Policies HS.1, BE.15, BE.22, BE.23 and BE.24 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (October 2003) and the the Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance for Residential Extensions, Alterations and Conversions and New Residential Development.."
