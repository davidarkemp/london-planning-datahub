    "Condition : 1 - The trees shown on the deposited plan as to be retained shall be retained and maintained to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 2 - No preparatory works, site clearance or building operations shall commence until the trees referred to in Condition have been adequately protected by fencing or other suitable means of enclosure to a height of not less than 1.2 m and at a radius from the trunk as specified in BS5837 1991 Guide for Trees in relation to Construction (ie at the edge of the tree canopy or at a distance which is half the height of the tree (whichever is the greater)), unless otherwise agreed with the Local Authority.

The replanting shall take place in the first available planting season.  Reason for condition: To preserve and maintain the visual amenities and character of the locality.",
