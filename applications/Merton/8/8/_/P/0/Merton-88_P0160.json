    "Condition : 2 - No preparatory works, site clearance or building operations shall commence until the trees referred to in Condition have been adequately protected by fencing or other suitable means of enclosure to a height of not less than 1.2 m and at a radius from the trunk as specified in BS5837 1991 Guide for Trees in relation to Construction (ie at the edge of the tree canopy or at a distance which is half the height of the tree (whichever is the greater)), unless otherwise agreed with the Local Authority. Such fencing shall be inspected and approved as acceptable by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of works and maintained until the conclusion of all site and building operations.  Reason for condition: To ensure that the existing trees are not damaged or otherwise adversely affected during all site operations, and to preserve and maintain the visual amenities and character of the locality.",
    "Condition : 3 - Any tree shown for retention, which is identified as being dead, dying, dangerous or mutilated, within three years from the completion of building works, thereby needing to be removed, shall be replaced by a semi-mature or mature tree of the same species or a tree of height, girth and species to be agreed with the Local Planning Authority. The replanting shall take place in the first available planting season.  Reason for condition: To preserve and maintain the visual amenities and character of the locality.",
    "Condition : 4 - During the period of building operations, the area within the protective fencing shall not be disturbed unless otherwise agreed by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason for condition: To preserve and maintain the visual amenities of the locality."
