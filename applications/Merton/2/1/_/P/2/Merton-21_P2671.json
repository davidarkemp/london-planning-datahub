    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, due to its scale, contrived design and visually incongruous roof form, fails to respect the proportions and form of the existing building. It would therefore be harmful to the character and appearance of the dwelling and the wider streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its mass, would be harmful to the residential amenity of the neighbouring dwellings, due to the extension's projection beyond the rear elevation at first floor level and the proximity to the boundaries with the neighbouring properties on either side of the site. This would create an overbearing effect and obstructing the ingress of natural light to the neighbouring sites. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed front facing dormer window, by reason of its mass, would create an unattractive bulky addition, which will be highly visually prominent to the detriment of the streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
