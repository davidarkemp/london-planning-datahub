    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion, by reason of its unit size, would fail to meet the minimum gross internal floor area as set out by the Technical Housing Standards - nationally described space standards 2015; thereby failing to comply with Article 3, Paragraph 9A of the GPDO 2015 (as amended). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would be subject to a section 106 legal agreement restricting future occupiers/users from obtaining a parking permit. The lack of an agreement in this instance is not considered compliant and would raise concerns with potential increase in car use resulting in pressure toward on-street parking, congestion, road safety and local amenity. This would be contrary to Policy CS20 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and DM T2 and DM T3 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011)."
