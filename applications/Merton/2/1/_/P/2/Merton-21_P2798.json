    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions, by reason of their design, scale, form, and massing, would represent unduly bulky and visually dominant additions, failing to respect the original form and features of the building and upsetting the pattern of development along Commonside West. The proposed roof works would have a detrimental effect on the positive contribution that the property makes to the Conservation Area and Commonside West streetscene, failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D3, D4 and HC1, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2, D3 and D4. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
