    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions of the building, by reason of their depth, height, form and sitting, would appear out of keeping with the scale and proportions of the original building and terrace, and would appear unduly dominant. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the building and neighbouring terrace houses, contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extensions of the building, by reason of their depth, height, form and sitting, would be unduly intrusive, resulting in sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers and result in a material loss of daylight / sunlight. The proposal would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
