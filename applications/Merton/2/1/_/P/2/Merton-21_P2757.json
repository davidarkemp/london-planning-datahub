    "Reason : 1 - The extension due to its relatively excessive depth, would reduce the outlook from the neighbouring front ground floor habitable room window of the property immediately to the west, to the detriment of the amenity of the occupants. The proposal would fail to comply with Site and Policies Plan 2014 Policy DMD2.",
    "Reason : 2 - The extension would fail to relate positively and appropriately to the rhythm, siting and scale of the building and existing pattern of development along the street to the detriment of the character and appearance of the building, street and surrounding area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with London Plan 2021 Policy D4, Core Strategy 2011 Policy CS14 and Site and Policies Plan 2014 Policies DMD1 and DMD2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\t\r\n\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
