    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: WR 003 Rev A; WR 004 Rev A; WR 006; WR 007; WR 008; Location Plan",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - The development approved under this application along with the development approved at No. 50 Wandle Road (Council ref: 21/P2000) shall be implemented at the same time and fully completed as one operation. At no time shall the approved loft level be occupied until the approved external works at No. 50 Wandle Road are complete.\r\n\r\nReason - To ensure that the development proposed results in a co-ordinated roof form, and therefore complies with policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy and policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. The works would not be acceptable without this condition in place given that development to one property only would result in a discordant roof form. \r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n\r\n"
