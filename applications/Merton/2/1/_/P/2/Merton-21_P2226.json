  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its height, depth, and siting, coupled with the property's short rear garden would lead to an overly dominant and un-neighbourly form of development, resulting in an undue sense of enclosure, and overshadowing to the detriment of the amenities of neighbouring properties at 29 and 30 Morland Close. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, and DMD2, DMD3 and DMD4 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
