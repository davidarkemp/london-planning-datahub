    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its depth, height and form, would be unduly dominant and intrusive, resulting in a sense of enclosure and loss of daylight/sunlight to the neighbouring occupiers at no.55 Morden Road. The proposal would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n",
