  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in the net loss of family sized units, which would amount to an inappropriate development that is not supported in principle, and would be detrimental to Merton's housing stock. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS14 d (b) i. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development due to its design, height, siting and massing would result in a visually dominant and bulky addition that fails to respect the form, proportions and scale of the original building. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D1, DM D2 and DMD3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan policy D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers due to: i) inadequate floor areas, ii) inadequate external amenity space/winter gardens, and iii) poor levels of privacy. The proposals would fail to comply with policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy D6 of the London Plan ",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that new dwelling is prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 London Plan, policy DM T1, DM T2 and DM T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE 1  -  Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
