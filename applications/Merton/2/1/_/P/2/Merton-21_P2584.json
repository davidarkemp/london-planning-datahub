    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its backgarden siting, design, height, bulk and mass results in a dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to relate to the pattern of development in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the lack of information to ascertain floor to ceiling height, unacceptable layout and insufficient private amenity space the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of lack of satisfactory and sufficient waste and recycling storage facilities, the scheme fails to comply with, in particular, the London Plan 2021 Policy SI 7 and Policy CS 17 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of unacceptable siting, height and design, the proposed development results in a visually intrusive form of development that will adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants.  The first floor windows will introduce new elevated views where currently none exists that would adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 94 Tavistock Crescent by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that the new development would meet environmental performance and water usage during construction development contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, Policy CS 15 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies SI 2 and SI 5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and solutions had not been tabled to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
