    "Reason : 1 - By virtue of its scale, form and design, the proposed rear roof extension would unduly detract the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal falls contrary to Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14, London Plan (2021) Policy D4, and Merton SPP (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3 in respect of character and appearance. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n"
