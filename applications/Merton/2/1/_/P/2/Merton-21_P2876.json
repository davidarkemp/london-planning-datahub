    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion, by reason of the loss of the existing family sized unit and failure to re-provide at least one family sized unit, would be contrary to the requirements of Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS 14. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed conversion, by reason of the provision undersized unit sizes and failure to provide convenient access to the external amenity for the upper level units, would result in an unsatisfactory standard of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. This would be contrary to the London Plan (2021) Policy D6, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM D2 and the DCLG's Technical Housing Standards (nationally described space standards) (2015).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed positioning of the cycle storage shed at the rear of the garden would not be considered well-located, failing to provide residents convenient access thereby likely discouraging residents from using the cycle shed and failing to fully promote the use of more sustainable modes of travel. This would be contrary to the London Plan (2021) Policy T5 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS18. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumption reductions can be achieved so as to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies SI 2 and SI 5, and Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) Policy CS 15.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
