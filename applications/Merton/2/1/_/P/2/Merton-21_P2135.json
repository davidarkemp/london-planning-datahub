  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due to its design, scale, height and massing would appear visually dominant and incongruous. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of this part of Mitcham, and fails to create a coherent or comfortable piece of townscape. The proposal therefore fails to comply with SPP Policy DM D1 and DM D2, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan 2021 policy D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development due to the position of side window openings and external terrace, as well as the height, depth and siting of the building, would result in a loss of privacy and create an overbearing and unneighbourly presence to the detriment of neighbour's living conditions. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed cycle storage arrangement due to its reliance on folding cycle provision fails to meet London Plan policy T5, which seeks to remove barriers to cycling and create a healthy environment in which people choose to cycle.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE 1 -   Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
