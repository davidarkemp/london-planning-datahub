    "Reason : 1 - The operations would result in the creation of two or more separate dwellinghouses falling within Use Class C3, rather than as a building within Use Class C4 (only). The proposal therefore does not comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class L of the Permitted Development Order 1995 (as amended), along with the tolerances set out within the (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). ",
