    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent again did not engage in any pre-application discussions or make revisions based on previous refusals..\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The size, siting, materials and design of the rear roof extensions represent an unneighbourly form of development that is visually intrusive, resulting in a loss of light & outlook, unduly dominant and which fails to respect the appearance, materials, scale, bulk, proportions and character of the original building and its wider setting including views from the Lambton Road Conservation Area and is therefore considered to be contrary to policies D3 and HC 1 in the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2, DM D3 & DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).\r\n     \r\n"
