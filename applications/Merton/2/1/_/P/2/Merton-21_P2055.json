    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front dormers by reason of their size, design position and number, would appear visually intrusive, undermining the original form of the building and would create a cluttered roof profile, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the building and local area. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D1, DM D2 and DMD3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan policy D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of poor outlook and daylight to kitchen/dining areas would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of living conditions to the detriment of the amenities of future occupants. The proposals would therefore be contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D6 and Merton SPP (2014) policy DM D2.  ",
