    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, massing and siting would result in an unacceptable level of visual intrusion, loss of outlook, and sense of enclosure, to the detriment of occupiers of Nos. 32 and 36 Cottenham Park Road, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014)   ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive height, bulk, massing, and siting would not relate positively and appropriately to surrounding buildings, and would have a detrimental impact on the Cottenham Park Road street scene, contrary to policies DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (July 2011). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of residential accommodation, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and D6 of the London Plan (2021). ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would result in a net increase of 8 residential units, the site is located in a controlled parking zone, and there is no legal agreement in place for the units to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS.20 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
