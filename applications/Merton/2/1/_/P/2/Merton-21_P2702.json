    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its size and siting is considered an unneighbourly form of development which would be visually intrusive, overly dominant and harmful to the amenity of neighbours due to loss of outlook and sense of enclosure contrary to the principles of policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of design, siting, scale, height, proportions and massing, represents an overly large, unduly dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would not respect the design, detailing, scale, bulk, proportions and character of the original building and  fails to relate positively and appropriately to the scale, proportions, height and massing of surrounding buildings or to use appropriate architectural detailing to complement and enhance the character of the wider setting and as such would be harmful to the visual amenities of the Bond Road streetscene, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, LBM Core Strategy Policy CS14 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (2014).   ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
