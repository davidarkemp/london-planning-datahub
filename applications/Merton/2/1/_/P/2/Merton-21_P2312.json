The approved measures shall be implemented upon commencement of the development and shall be so maintained for the duration of construction, unless the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority is first obtained to any variation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the safety of construction and the amenities of the surrounding area and to comply with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011, and policy DM D2 and DM T2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
