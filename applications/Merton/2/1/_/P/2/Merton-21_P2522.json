    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its use and siting, would be an un-neighbourly form of development, utilising inappropriate premises, resulting in noise and disturbance, detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby residential properties. The proposals would therefore be contrary to London Plan (2021) policies E2, D3 and D14 and Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM.D2 and DM.EP2.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that i) the proposals will not result in increased risk to the environment from pollutants and ii) the proposals will not result in increased risk of conflict between vehicles and pedestrians nor that it would not cause inconvenience to local residents from increased vehicle traffic along the accessway contrary to policies E 2 in the London Plan 2021, DM EP 4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and CS20 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
