    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension / infill extension, by reason of its depth, height, form and sitting, would be unduly intrusive, resulting in sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers and result in a material loss of light. The proposal would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension / infill extension, by reason of its depth, height, form and sitting, would appear out of keeping with the scale and proportions of the original building, and would appear unduly dominant. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the building and terrace, contary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014",
