    "Reason : 1 - By virtue of its scale, form and design, the proposed first floor extension and dormer roof extension would cause material harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal is considered contrary to the London Plan (2021) policy D4, Core Strategy (2011) policy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of arboricultural inforamtion, Officers cannot be certain there would be no harm to a large tree which is thought to be subject to a Tree Preservation Order or in any case has significant amenity value. Therefore, the proposal is considered contrary to London Plan Policy G7, Policy CS13 and SPP Policy DMO2 in respect of trees.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\nAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\nThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\nThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\nIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n"
