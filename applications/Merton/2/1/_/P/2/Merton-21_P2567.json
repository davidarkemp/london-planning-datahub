    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the document entitled 'Details of Materials' (dated November 2021) written by Andrew Harper Architects unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 5 - No development [including demolition] pursuant to this consent shall commence until an Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, drafted in accordance with the recommendations and guidance set out in BS 5837:2012 has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and the approved details have been installed.  The details and measures as approved shall be retained and maintained, until the completion of all site operations.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - ï¿½Site supervision: The details of the Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan shall include the retention of an arboricultural expert to supervise, monitor and report to the LPA not less than monthly the status of all tree works and tree protection measures throughout the course of the construction period. At the conclusion of the construction period the arboricultural expert shall submit to the LPA a satisfactory completion statement to demonstrate compliance with the approved protection measures.",
    "Condition : 7 - All hard and soft landscape works shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details as shown on drawing CR024 (R1) and CR020 unless otherwise agreed by the Local Planning Authority. The works shall be carried out in the first available planting season following the completion of the development or prior to the occupation of any part of the development, whichever is the sooner, and any trees which die within a period of 5 years from the completion of the development, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased or are dying, shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of same approved specification, unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation. All hard surfacing and means of enclosure shall be completed before the development is first occupied.",
    "Condition : 8 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied, the loft dormer windows in the north-west side elevation shall be glazed with obscured glass and shall be maintained as such thereafter.",
    "Condition : 9 - The proposed garden room/outbuilding adjacent to the boundary of no. 20 Clifton Road shall be used for no other purpose other than that ancillary to the main dwellinghouse",
    "Condition : 10 - Access to the flat roof of the single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 11 - The implementation of a vehicle crossover will be subject to a separate Vehicle Crossover Application with the Council. Applications for crossovers sited within controlled parking zones will be required to meet the criteria outlined the Vehicle Crossover Information Pack . If it is necessary to remove an existing on street parking space an amendment to the Traffic Order will be required. All fees must be paid by the applicant to cover the council's costs in advertising and consulting on the proposal and will also significantly delay the process of approving a crossover application. The council may refuse an application where it is considered that the removal of too many onstreet spaces or provision of too many crossovers would lead to insufficient on street space being available. The approval of a crossover would be subject to the outcome of a statutory consultation and therefore cannot be guaranteed. Should street furniture need to be re-located, this shall be at the expense of the applicant. ",
    "Condition : 12 - No surface water runoff should discharge onto the public highway including the public footway or highway. When it is proposed to connect to a public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.   Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).",
    "Condition : 13 - No waste material, including concrete, mortar, grout, plaster, fats, oils and chemicals shall be washed down on the highway or disposed of into the highway drainage system.",
    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building. Further information is available at the following link: \r\nhttp://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/buildingpolicyandlegislation/current legislation/partywallact\r\n",
    "Condition : 15 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n   i) The application was the subject of a number of non-material amendments. \r\nii) An extended expiry was agreed with the applicant. \r\n\r\n"
