    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension element, by reason of its mass, form and design, would be harmful to the character and form of the existing dwelling and the overall streetscene, due to the disproportionate dimensions of this element of the proposal, which would dominate the existing roof structure and the unattractive blocky design of the extension within the context of the host and neighbouring dwellings' more intricate roof designs, which define the streetscene. This would be visible from Pepys Road and would adversely impact upon the streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor side and rear and wrap-a-round roof extensions, by reason of their mass and proximity to the side boundary with the neighbouring property to the south, no. 116, would be harmful to the residential amenity of this property. As a result, there would be a loss of outlook, as the development would have an adverse overbearing effect that would result in an unduly oppressive living environment for existing and future residents of no. 116.The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance: \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
