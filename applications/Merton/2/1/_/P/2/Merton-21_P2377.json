    "Reason : 1 - Overall, the proposed rear extension, by reason of its depth, height and form, would be unduly dominant and intrusive, resulting in sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers at both 2 and 6 Poplar Avenue. The proposal would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
