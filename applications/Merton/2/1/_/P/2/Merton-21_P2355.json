    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear outbuilding, by reason of its mass, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the dwelling, due to the disproportionate scale of the outbuilding, in comparison with the overall size of the site and the main dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its mass, would be harmful to the residential amenity of the neighbouring dwellings, due to the outbuilding's scale impacting on the outlook from the rear facing windows of neighbouring properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming."
