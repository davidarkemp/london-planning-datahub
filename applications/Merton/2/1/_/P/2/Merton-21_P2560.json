    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of design, position, scale, bulk and massing, would be an unneighbourly form of development being unduly prominent and visually dominant and intrusive, resulting in a loss of light and outlook and as such would be harmful to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers at 12 Leominster Road.. The proposal would therefore be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).\r"
