  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to its scale, form, design and siting would:\r\na) Fail to respect the rhythm, scale, materials and architectural design of the host building and terrace, giving rise to an overly bulky development with a style that is of context, thus resulting in material harm to the character of the host building terrace and wider area.\r\nb) Fails to provide sufficient outdoor amenity space, which would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation.\r\nc) Fails to provide a safe and secure pedestrian environment and public realm. \r\nThe proposals would be contrary to Sites and Polices Plan Policy DM D1 and DM D2, Core Strategy Policy CS 13 and London Plan 2021 Policy D3, D4, D5, D6 and D8.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of  issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
