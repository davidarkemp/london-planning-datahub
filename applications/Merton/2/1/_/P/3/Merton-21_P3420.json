    "Reason : 1 - By virtue of its scale, form and massing, the proposed development would harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D1, D3 and D4, Core Strategy (2011) policy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - By virtue of its scale, bulk and massing, the proposed development would harm the amenity of neighbouring properties through overbearing increased sense of enclosure, loss of daylight and sunlight contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DMD2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would have an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation providing poor levels of daylight and outlook. The development would also fall short of the required space standards for internal space and private amenity space. As such, the proposed development would fall contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement the proposal would be contrary to policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011). ",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development would provide inadequate space for bins. Therefore, the development would fall contrary to London Plan (2021) Policy SI6 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS17. ",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
