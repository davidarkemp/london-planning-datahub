    "Reason : 1 - The scale, form, depth and appearance of the proposals are considered to have a detrimental impact upon the character or appearance of the host building, the surrounding area and the streetscene. In addition it would have a detrimental impact on the neighbouring amenity of 21 Quicks Road by way of loss of light and overbearing impact. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
