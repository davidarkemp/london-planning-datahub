    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions by virtue of their position, bulk, design and appearance i) fail to respect and complement the design, form, scale, bulk, proportions and detailing of the original building and the character and appearance of the wider setting or to enhance local context by responding positively to the scale, proportions and appearance of terraces that form the Cul de Sac and ii) would result in a loss of openness and an overbearing relationship with the street scene that would constitute an obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would be out of keeping with, and detrimental to, the visual amenity and character of the St. Helier Estate as a whole. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3, Core Strategy 2011 policy CS14, Sites and Policies Plan 2014 Policies DMD2 and DMD3 and the St Helier Estate Design Guide",
    "Reason : 2 - The size, siting and design of the proposed new house and the first floor rear extension to the existing house represents an unneighbourly, overly dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would result in a loss of outlook and light and create  a detrimental sense of enclosure that would harm the amenity of neighbouring residents  contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposals by reason of the design and layout of the sitel fails to provide readily accessible cycle storage contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS18 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and section 8.5.3 of the London Cycling Design Standards 2016 ",

    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
