    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey extension, by reason of its depth, height, form and sitting, fails to respect the design and proportions of the original building, the paired buildings and the character of this part of the street scene, it would therefore appear unduly dominant and creates visual unbalance. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the building, neighbouring houses and the local area, contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two-storey extension, by reason of its depth, height, form and sitting, would be unduly intrusive, resulting in unreasonable sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers at No. 16 Victory Avenue, result in a material loss of day light and material loss of outlook. The proposal would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1  - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome.\r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
