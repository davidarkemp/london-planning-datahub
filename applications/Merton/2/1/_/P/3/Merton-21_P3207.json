    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined unacceptable siting, design, height, bulk and mass results in an incongruous, overbearing, unsympathetic and prominent form of development that fails to reflect the pattern of development in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding area.  The unacceptable height will also create a sense of enclosure and potentially result in overshadowing to the nearby occupants, in particular, the existing dwelling at no. 20.  The proposal would fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D1 and DM D4 of the Merton Site and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to include measures in order to ensure that the proposal is Air Quality Neutral and therefore fails to comply with policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
