    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two-storey side extension and associated roof works by reason of design, bulk and siting would be unduly dominant and out of keeping with the design and character of the host building, visually intrusive, detract from the appearance and garden suburb character and sense of openness of this part of the St Helier Estate and would be harmful to the visual amenities of the neighbouring residents at 30 Croxden Walk and the wider streetscene and contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and the St Helier Design Guide."
