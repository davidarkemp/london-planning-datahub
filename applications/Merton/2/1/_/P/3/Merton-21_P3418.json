    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, height, design, position and form, the extensions entail inappropriate forms of development that would be visually dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, semi-detached pair and the wider area. Therefore, the proposals are contrary to policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011, policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
