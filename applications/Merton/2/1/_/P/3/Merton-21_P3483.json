    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of design, position, scale, bulk and massing would be an unneighbourly form of development being unduly prominent and visually dominant and intrusive, resulting in a loss of light and outlook and as such would be harmful to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at 16 Mawson Close. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D3, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
