    "Condition : 1 - INFORMATIVE 2 - Refused Drawings\r\n\r\n1855/G/00; E-1855-G-03/2A; E-1855-G-03/2",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side extension, by reason of its design, coupled with the prominent location of the dwelling within the immediate streetscene would constitute an addition that would appear out of keeping with the scale and proportions of the original building and neighbouring buildings. Toward the streetscene the extended dwellinghouse appearance would result in the loss of balance between the terraced dwellings failing to respect the scale and massing of the original dwellinghouse, and would overall have a negative impact toward the Central Road streetscene.The proposal would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed side extension would by reason of its depth, height, proximity to the site boundaries, lack of boundary screening between the proposed building and the existing No.58 Bruton Road and proposed fenestration, result in material harm to the neighbouring occupier at No.58 Bruton Road by way of loss of outlook and would result in material harm to the existing occupiers of No.58 Bruton Road and future occupiers of the proposed building by way of overlooking and loss of privacy, contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
