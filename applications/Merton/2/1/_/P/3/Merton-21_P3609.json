    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its design, scale, form, bulk, massing and siting would represent a visually discordant arrangement of roof forms which would have a negative impact by diminishing the quality of the rear extension's roofscape; and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Locally Listed Building. The proposal would be contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
