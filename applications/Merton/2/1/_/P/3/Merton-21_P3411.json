    "Condition : 3 - The applicant should be aware that the site may provide a useful habitat for swifts. Swifts are currently in decline in the UK and in order to encourage and improve the conservation of swifts the applicant is advised to consider the installation of swift nesting box/bricks on site.",
    "Condition : 4 - Should the development subject of this certificate of lawfulness adjoin the development proposed in planning application 21/P3408 then planning permission would be required for the whole development to assess the cumulative impact"
