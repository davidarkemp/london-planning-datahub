    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor element of the two storey rear extension by reason of a combination of its design, depth and siting would be visually intrusive and overbearing  contrary to Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to provide practical rear amenity spaces for both proposed units. The proposal would therefore fail to meet the requirements of policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - In absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' development, the proposals would generate additional parking pressure in the area and would be contrary to policies DM T2 and DM T3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan and policy CS 20 of Merton Core Planning Strategy. ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
