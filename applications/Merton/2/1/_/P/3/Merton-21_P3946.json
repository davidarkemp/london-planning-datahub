    "Reason : 1 - The proposed ground, first floor and roof extension, by reason of design, position, scale, bulk, layout, orientation and appearance is considered to be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive, detracting from the appearance, design, bulk, scale and proportions of the host dwelling, failing to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale, proportions, height, massing and symmetry  of surrounding buildings, existing street patterns and the character and quality of the public realm and as such would fail to conserve and enhance the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area would  be harmful to the character and visual amenities of the Commonside East street scene. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and HC1, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed ground, first floor and roof extension, by reason of the design, position, bulk and massing, represents an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive resulting in a sense of enclosure detrimental to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D3, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
