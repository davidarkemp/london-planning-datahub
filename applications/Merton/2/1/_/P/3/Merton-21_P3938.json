    "Reason : 1 - The proposals due to its scale, design and siting, would appear visually dominant, and be an overly intensive form of development, at odds with this part of the site's rear garden character. The development would therefore have a harmful effect on the character and appearance of the host site and neighbouring area, contrary to policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS13 and CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of their design, layout and location would result in an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation for future occupiers, by reason of the constrained outlook, potential lack of sunlight, and failure to provide a safe and secure environment. The proposals would fail to comply with policy, D3, D5 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS.14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy, and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n",
