    "Condition : 2 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 3 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: \r\nMKM/21/CAV72/PL01 (03/03), MKM/21/CAV72/PL02 (01/04)\r\nMKM/21/CAV72/PL02 (02/04), MKM/21/CAV72/PL02 (04/04) \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Access to the flat roof of the development hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 5 - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was amended following advice form the case officer.\r\n   ii The application was approved without delay.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building. Further information is available at the following link: \r\nhttp://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/buildingpolicyandlegislation/current legislation/partywallact\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nYou are advised to contact the Council's Highways team on 020 8545 3700 before undertaking any works within the Public Highway to obtain the necessary approvals and/or licences. Please be advised that there is a further charge for this work. If your application falls within a Controlled Parking Zone this has further costs involved and can delay the application by 6 to 12 months.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of their massing, scale, bulk, and cumulative impact, coupled with the prominent location of the dwelling within the streetscape, is considered to result to an obtrusive form of development that would fail to reflect the design or complement the bulk and proportions of the original building. The proposal would also have undue negative impacts on neighbouring amenity in terms shadowing and quality of living conditions. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan policies D3 and D4, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the SPP 2014 and CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011. ",
