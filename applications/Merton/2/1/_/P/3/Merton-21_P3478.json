    "Reason : 1 - The proposals due to their scale, design and siting, would appear visually bulky and out of scale on the site. They would fail to respond to the established positioning of massing along the street including the legibility of different built forms that contribute towards the character and distinctiveness of the local street scene. The development would therefore be contrary to policy D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals, by reason of their scale, form and sitting, would result in a sense of enclosure and loss of light to the occupiers of 18 Devonshire Road. The proposals would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3, policy CS 14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
