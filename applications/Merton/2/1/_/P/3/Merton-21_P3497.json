    "Condition : 1 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.

    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension side dormer window, by reason of its design, scale and position in the roofslope is considered to be an unacceptable and an incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing Locally Listed Building, street scene and wider Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton's Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and Policy CS 14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
