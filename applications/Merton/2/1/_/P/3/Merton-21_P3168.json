    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, in particular the proposed roof form, would by reason of its height, bulk, massing, form, design and appearance, coupled with its depth, result in a cumbersome and top heavy addition, which would not respect the proportions and appearance of the host dwelling and would appear visually conspicuous and out of keeping with the character and appearance of the streetscene. The proposed development would be contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n"
