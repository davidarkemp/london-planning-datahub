The drainage scheme must dispose of surface water by means of a sustainable drainage system (SuDS) to include a flow restriction device, limited to a greenfield rate of no more than 2l/s in accordance with drainage hierarchy contained within the London Plan Policy (5.12, 5.13 and SPG) and the advice contained within the National SuDS Standards. \r\n\r\nReason: To reduce the risk of surface and foul water flooding to the proposed development and future users, and ensure surface water and foul flood risk does not increase offsite in accordance with Merton's policies CS16 of the Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) & DMF2 of the Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014). \r\n",
    "Condition : 15 - Prior to the commencement of development, the applicant shall submit a detailed proposal on how drainage and groundwater  will be managed and mitigated during (dewatering) and post construction (permanent phase), for example through the implementation of passive drainage measures around the basement structure. \r\n \r\nReason: To ensure flood risk does not increase offsite in accordance with Merton's policies CS16 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011(July 2011) & DMF2 of the Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).  \r\n",
    "Condition : 16 - No development shall be commenced until a detailed construction method statement is submitted and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The construction method statement shall include details of construction sequence and temporary propping and shall be reviewed and agreed by a chartered structural designer.\r\n\r\nReason: The details  are considered to be material to the acceptability of the proposal and for safeguarding the amenity of neighbouring residential properties and to comply with policy DM D2 of the adopted Merton sites and Policies Plan 2014.    ",
    "Condition : 17 - Informative: A Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water will be required for discharging groundwater into a public sewer. Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provision of the Water Industry Act 1991. We would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures they will undertake to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquires should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 020 3577 9483 or by emailing trade.effluent@thameswater.co.uk. Application forms should be completed online via www.thameswater.co.uk. Please refer to the Wholesale; Business customers; Groundwater discharges section.  ",
    "Condition : 18 - Informative: Thames Water will aim to provide customers with a minimum pressure of 10m head (approx 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where it leaves Thames Waters pipes. The developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of the proposed development."
