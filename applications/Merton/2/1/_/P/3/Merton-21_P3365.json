    "Reason : 1 - Flat 1 would fail to meet the minimum standards for a single bedroom which would in turn result in cramped and unsatisfactory conditions for future occupiers and the submission has failed to demonstrate that satisfactory external amenity space is provided for Flats 2 and 3. The proposal would therefore fail to meet the requirements of policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - In absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' development, the proposals would generate additional parking pressure in the area and would be contrary to policies DM T2 and DM T3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan and policy CS 20 of Merton Core Planning Strategy. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed works at roof level, raising of the ridge height by 200mm, the bulky parapet walls and increase in bulk and massing to the rear outrigger, by reason of its design, character and appearance, would harm the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area which would be contrary to policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to provide sufficient cycle space therefore the proposal fails to comply with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nShould the applicant wish to submit an amended application they are encouraged to submit a Design and Access Statement. More information can be found following this link: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-an-application#Design-and-Access-Statement"
