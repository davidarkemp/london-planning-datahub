    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its scale, position and design would appear visually prominent and intrusive, and result in material harm to the character and appearance of the local area including the Farm Road Pavilion and Playing Fields, contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM 01 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policy CS14 of the Core Strategy, Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021 and paragraph 115 and 130 of the NPPF 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal due to its scale, position and design would fail to protect and enhance designated Open Space, and fails to retain or improve access to Open Space, contrary to Merton Sites and Polices Plan 2014 policy DMO1.",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would safeguard existing viable leisure, recreational and sporting facilities or support proposals for new and improved facilities, contrary to Core Strategy 2011 policy CS13",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that adequate tree protection or mitigation measures would be delivered as part of a proposal, contrary to Sites and Policies Plan DMO2 and London Plan 2021 policy G7.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE 1  - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions through submitting a request for pre-application through the Councils Standard route for applicants.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek formal pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
