    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey element of the proposal by reason of its design, size, scale and mass would result in an overbearing, visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that would dominate the form of the host building, harm the visual amenities of the streetscene and result in material harm to neighbouring amenity by way of a materially harmful overbearing effect and sense of enclosure to occupiers at no. 4 Evesham Road. The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of LBM Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
