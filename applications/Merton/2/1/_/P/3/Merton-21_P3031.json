    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of a legal agreement restricting future occupants from obtaining parking permits in the nearby Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ), the proposal would cause undue pressure on parking in the local area.  As such, the proposal would be contrary Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS 20, and policies DMT2 and DMT3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  Further, the proposal would fail to be car free contrary policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would fail to comply with Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM D2 in terms of neighbour amenity. The scale, bulk and massing of the proposal is such that there would be an excessive increased sense of enclosure towards no. 196-198 Hartfield Road. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n"
