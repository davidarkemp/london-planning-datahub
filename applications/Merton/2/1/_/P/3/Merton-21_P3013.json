    "Reason : 1 - The proposals due to its scale, design and siting, would appear visually dominant, and be an overly intensive form of development, at odds with this part of the site's rear garden character. The development would therefore have a harmful effect on the character and appearance of the host site and neighbouring area, contrary to policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS13 and CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be of a high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners, addressing apsects such as private internal space, spatial quality and privacy. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan and DMD2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development due to its height, depth and siting, would result create an overbearing and unneighbourly presence to the detriment of the neighbour's living conditions at 54 Aragon Road. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n",
