    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would have an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation providing poor levels of daylight and outlook. The development would also fall short of the required space standards for internal space. As such, the proposed development would fall contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "Reason : 2 - The size, siting and design of the proposed ground floor rear extension cominded with the first floor addition represents an unneighbourly, overly dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would result in a visually intrusive form of development and a detrimental sense of enclosure that would harm the amenity of neighbouring occupants contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)",
    "Reason : 3 - The size, siting and design of the proposed rear roof terrace, which would be visible from Elmhurst Avenue to the rear, would appear visually intrusive, unduly dominant and unsympathetic to the appearance, materials, scale, bulk, proportions and character of the original building and the wider area and in addition, would be harmful to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers by way of noise disturbance and visual intrusion, contrary to policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional dwellings over and above the number of units currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011."
