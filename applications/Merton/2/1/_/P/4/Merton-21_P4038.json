    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its design, scale, form and massing, would result in an awkwardly bulky and dominant addition which would visually compete with the main building and harmfully unbalance the character and appearance of the semi-detached pair to the detriment of the Kenley Road streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
