    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size, scale, design and height within the small amenity area of the site, would result in harm to the existing dwelling and character of the wider area. It would therefore be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Council's adopted Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Council's adopted Site and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, due to its size and proximity to the neighbouring properties, would be overbearing, visually intrusive and would cause a loss of light to the amenity of the occupiers of No. 21 Montague Road and Ground Floor Flat at 23 Montague Road contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel) and DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), Policy CS20 (Parking, servicing and delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policies T6 (Car Parking) and T6.1 (Residential Parking) of the London Plan (2021).\r\n",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
