    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions, by reason of their depth, height, form and sitting, would be unduly dominant and overbearing, resulting in harm to the living conditions of occupiers at No. 82 Carisbrook Road, contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extensions, by reason of their depth, height, form and sitting, would appear out of keeping with the scale, proportions and design of the original building, the semi-detached pair as well as other houses along the street. The proposals would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the building, its pair and the wider area, contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers due to inadequate external amenity spaces. The proposals would fail to comply with policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal would not provide a mix of housing types to meet the needs of all sectors of the community. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS8, and policy H10 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal would exacerbate pressure on kerbside parking locally to the detriment of the amenities of existing residents. The proposal would directly result in highway safety issues due to the use of the front forecourt for car parking, facilitated by the applicant's placement of refuse, cycle and landscaping along with the positioning of the boundary wall. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy DM T2 and DM T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy T4 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE 1  - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
