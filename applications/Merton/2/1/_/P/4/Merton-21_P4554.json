The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 3 - The development is only just within Permitted Development tolerances in terms of volume. You are advised to complete the development in full accordance with the plans, as if the development is larger than that covered by this Certificate a breach of planning control could result.",
    "Condition : 4 - The applicant should be aware that the site may provide a useful habitat for swifts.
