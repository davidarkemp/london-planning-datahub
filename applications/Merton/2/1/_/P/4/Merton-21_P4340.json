  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The change of use from a dwelling (C3) to a small HMO (C4) would be considered permitted development, however it is noted that the planning consent 21/P0832 has not yet been implemented for the conversion of the single dwellinghouse into two self-contained units. Consequently this certificate would be to convert the single dwellinghouse into two self-contained units, one of which would be an HMO. This in turn would constitute as development which would fail to comply with the requirements set out in Class L, Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (as amended) and would therefore require planning permission.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nPlanning permission granted under 21/P0832 has not yet been implemeneted therefore existing use remains as a single family dwellinghouse.",
