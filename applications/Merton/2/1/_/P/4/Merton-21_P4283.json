    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Site Location Plan, Block Plan M3-08, Plans M3-01 Rev A, Plans M3-02 Rev A, M3-03 Rev A, M3-04 Rev A, M3-05 Rev A, M3-06 Rev A, M3-07 Rev A (Amended 11/04/2022) and M3-08.\r\n",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - Access to the flat roof of the development hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 5 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The applicant/agent was provided with pre-application advice.\r\n   ii) The applicant was offered the opportunity to submit amended plans in order to make the proposal acceptable in planning terms.\r\n   ",
    "Condition : 6 - Informative 1\r\nIt is noted that there is prior approval for a single storey rear extension that would extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by 6m (ref: 21/P3589). The applicant is advised that if built in conjunction with this planning permission, the proposed works under application (ref: 21/P3589) would require planning permission.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Informative 2\r\nThe applicant should be aware that the site may provide a useful habitat for swifts. Swifts are currently in decline in the UK and in order to encourage and improve the conservation of swifts the applicant is advised to consider the installation of a swift nesting box/bricks on the site.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor element of the proposed two storey side extension by reason of its design, size, scale and mass would result in an overbearing, visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that would dominate the form of the host building, harm the visual amenities of the streetscene and result in material harm to neighbouring amenity by way of a materially harmful overbearing effect and sense of enclosure and block light to occupiers at No. 4 Maycross Avenue. The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of LBM Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
