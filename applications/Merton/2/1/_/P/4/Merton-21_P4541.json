    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of combined unacceptable siting, design, height, depth, width, bulk and mass results in an unsympathetic and dominant form of overdevelopment that fails to respect the character of the host building destroying the symmetry with the semi-detached pair to the detriment of the siting, character and appearance of the conservation area and visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies CS14 of the Core Strategy, DM D2, DM D3, DM D4 of the Sites and Policies Plan, HC1 of the London Plan and paragraph 202 of the NPPF.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - Informative 1:\r\nRefused drawing numbers: \r\nSite Location Plan, Existing & Proposed Ground Floor Plans as amended 14/11/2022, Existing & Proposed First Floor Plans as amended 14/11/2022, Existing & Proposed Roof Plan as amended 14/11/2022, Existing & Proposed Front Elevation as amended 14/11/2022, Existing & Proposed Side Elevation as amended 14/11/2022, Existing & Proposed Rear Elevation as amended 14/11/2022",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
