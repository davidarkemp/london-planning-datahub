    "Reason : 1 - The existing single storey rear extension by reason of its design, size, height, massing, siting and materials would fail to achieve a high standard of design, failing to respect the host building, general pattern of development in the area and adding an incongruous addition that is an overly dominant and an un-neighbourly form of development that would result in visual intrusion and loss of outlook to 58 Greenwood Road and visual intrusion, loss of outlook and loss of privacy/overlooking of 62 Greenwood Road, contrary to planning policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021, DM D2 (Design Considerations in all developments) and DM D3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), and CS14 (Design) of Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
