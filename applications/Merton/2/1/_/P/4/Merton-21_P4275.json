    "Reason : 1 - The bin storage is more than 20m from Cowdrey Road and Haydons Road where bins will be collected. As such it fails to comply with a), Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The provision of adequate natural light in some of the habitable rooms of the dwellinghouse is considered unacceptable and would therefore fail to provide a high standard of accommodation. As such the proposals fails to comply with f), Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal includes operational development to the existing building to create new walls and a covered parking area, which would not fall within the relevant criteria under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), which is for change of use only. \r\n\r\n"
