    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mansard part of the roof extension over the main part of the building ,would rise above the front parapet wall, higher than the neighbouring properties on both sides which would interrupt the roofline to the detriment of the appearance of the street scene and would cause harm to neighbouring amenity at the rear. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with London Plan 2021 Policy D4, Merton Core Strategy 2011 Policy CS14 and Merton Site and Policies Plan 2014 Policies DM D2 and DM D3. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
