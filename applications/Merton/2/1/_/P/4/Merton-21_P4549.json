The owner should also confirm that suitable monitoring devices have been installed and maintained for the monitoring of the in-use energy performance indicators, as outlined in Chapter 5 'In-use stage' of the GLA 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance document. \r\nc, Upon completion of the first year of occupation following the end of the defects liability period (DLP) and for the following four years, the legal Owner is required to provide accurate and verified annual in-use energy performance data f",
    "Condition : 19 - Electric vehicle charging points (EVCP) shall be provided for 20% of the car parking spaces shown on drawing 2007_2100 and passive provision shall be made available for the remaining 80% of the spaces so that the spaces are capable of being readily converted to electric vehicle charging points. The location of the EVCP spaces and charging points, and a specification for passive provision shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority before first occupation of the building. The EVCP shall thereafter be constructed and marked out and the charging points installed prior to first use of the building and retained permanently thereafter. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure the provision of a satisfactory level of parking and comply with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Condition : 20 - Informative; In the event that the in-use evidence submitted shows that the as-built performance estimates have not been or are not being met, the legal Owner should use reasonable endeavours to investigate and identify the causes of underperformance and the potential mitigation measures and set these out in the relevant comment box of the 'be seen' spreadsheet. Where measures are identified, which it would be reasonably practicable to implement, an action plan comprising such measures should be prepared and agreed with the Local Planning Authority. The measures approved by the Local Planning Authority should be implemented by the legal Owner as soon as reasonably practicable. ",
    "Condition : 21 - Informative:\r\nCarbon emissions evidence requirements for Post Construction stage assessments must provide:\r\n\"\tDetailed documentary evidence confirming the Target Emission Rate (TER), Building Emission Rate (BER) and percentage improvement of BER over TER based on 'As Built' BRUKL model outputs; AND\r\n\"\tA copy of the Building Regulations Output Document from the approved software. The output documents must be based on the 'as built' stage of analysis and must account for any changes to the specification during construction; AND \r\nAND, where the developer has used SAP 10 conversion factors: \r\n\"\tThe completed Carbon Emissions Reporting Spreadsheet based on the 'As Built' SAP outputs.  \r\nAND, where applicable: \r\n\"\tMCS certificates and photos of all installed renewable technologies\r\n",
    "Condition : 22 - Informative: ASHPs, The details required by condition should include further information on the location, specification and efficiency of the proposed ASHPs (Coefficient of Performance, Seasonal Coefficient of Performance, and the Seasonal Performance Factor), with plans showing the ASHPs, any noise and visual mitigation measures, and other clarifications requested in climate change comments sent to the Applicant on 21st April 2022. ",
    "Condition : 23 - Informative. Thames Water will aim to provide customers with a minimum pressure of 10m head (approx. 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point it leaves Thames water pipes. The developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of the proposed development.",
    "Condition : 24 - Informative; No surface water runoff should discharge onto the public highway including the public footway or highway. When it is proposed to connect to a public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.   Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777). ",
    "Condition : 25 - Informative; Given the relative remoteness of the site the applicants are advised to incorporate the Safer by Design Officer's recommendations for improving safety and security as set out in their consultation response of January 7th 2022.    ",
