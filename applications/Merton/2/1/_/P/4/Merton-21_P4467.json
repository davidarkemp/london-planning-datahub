    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions due to their design, height, siting and massing would result in visually dominant and bulky additions that fail to respect the form, proportions and scale of the original building including gaps and spaces between houses. The proposals would therefore be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DMD2 and DMD3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan policy D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extensions, by reason of their scale, siting and design, would be overly dominant and un-neighbourly in form resulting in, an overbearing impact, a sense of enclosure, block light and lead to a loss of privacy for the neighbouring occupiers at 95 Cambridge Road. The proposals would therefore fail to comply with policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
