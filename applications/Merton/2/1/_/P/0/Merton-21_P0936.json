  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension and first floor external insulation, by reason of design, materials, position, bulk and massing, would be unduly prominent and visually dominant and intrusive, detracting from the appearance, scale and proportions of the host dwelling, failing to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale, proportions, height and massing of surrounding buildings, and resulting in the loss of a sense of spaciousness at the junction with Dhalia Gardens which contributes to the suburban character and quality of the locality. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D8, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIt is noted that the elevation drawings are not consistent in terms of the height of the proposed extension. This matter should be resolved in any resubmission."
