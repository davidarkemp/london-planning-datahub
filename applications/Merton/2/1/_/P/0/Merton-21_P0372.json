    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to the siting, appearance and scale of the proposed equipment would likely be visually intrusive and detrimental to the character of the Wimbledon Hill Conservation Area to which the site relates to and would likely cause harm to pedestrian free-flow movement on the pavement. This is contrary to policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D4, DM D6 and DM T5 of the Merton Council Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in amenity or health concerns as the submission did not include a Certificate of Conformity with the ICNIRP guidelines. This is contrary to DM D6 of the Merton Council Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
