    "Reason : 1 - By virtue of its scale, height, form and design, the development would appear incongruous with the host building and surrounding built form. Consequently the proposal would harm the character and appearance of the existing building and surrounding area and therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A, Part A.2. 1) e) of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended) regarding 'the external appearance of the building'.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a legal agreement restricting future occupants from obtaining parking permits in the nearby Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ), the proposal would cause undue pressure on parking in the local area thereby falling contrary to with Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A, Part A.2. 1) a) of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended) regarding 'transport and highways impacts of the development'.\r\n"
