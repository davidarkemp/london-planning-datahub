    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\n Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its siting, design, materials and layout would result in the provision of poor quality, unattractive, cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal floorspace standards to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers and would fail to provide good quality usable private amenity spaces whilst the proximity of the habitable room windows to the adjacent accessways would result in unacceptable issues of privacy and outlook to the detriment of future occupier amenity contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
