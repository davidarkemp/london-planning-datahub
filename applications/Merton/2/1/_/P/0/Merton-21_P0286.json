Planning permission would therefore be required.",
    "Reason : 2 - The first floor rear extension, by reason of its flat roof, would fail to meet Condition A.3(c) of Class A of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. Planning permission would therefore be required.",
