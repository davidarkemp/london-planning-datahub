  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by virtue of its height, massing and siting would be visually intrusive, overbearing and result in an unacceptable level of overshadowing of rear gardens, to the detriment of occupiers of No. 13 - 17 South Park Road, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of residential accommodation due to the flats being too small and failing to provide any private amenity space, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and D6 of the London Plan (2021). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in 4 additional residential units, the site is located in a controlled parking zone, has excellent access to public transport and there is no legal agreement in place for the units to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS.20 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
