  "description": "APPLICATION FOR PRIOR APPROVAL IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION WITH THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS: EXTENDS BEYOND THE REAR WALL OF THE ORIGINAL DWELLINGHOUSE BY 6 METRES. THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3 METRES. THE HEIGHT OF THE EAVES OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3 METRES.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its height, depth, scale and siting, would be an overly dominant and un-neighbourly form of development resulting in undue visual intrusion and loss of light to the detriment of the amenities of 49 Commonside East, contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
