    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due to its design, height, siting, massing and materials, would result in a discordant, bulky, and obtrusive form of development that would fail to respect the spacious character of the street, the relationship between buildings, as well as appearing out of character within this part of the John Innes Merton Park Conservation Area. The development therefore fails to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the building, street and the Conservation Area the site forms part of, contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D1, DM D2, DM D3, and DM D4, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan 2021 policy D3, D4 and HC1.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would by reason of its depth, height, siting and massing would result in material harm to the neighbouring occupier at No.5 Watery Lane by way of sense enclosure, loss of light, outlook and oppressive appearance, contrary to Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011, Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and London Plan 2021 policy D3.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\r\n",
