  "description": "ERECTION OF A FIRST FLOOR EXTENSION ABOVE EXISTING SINGLE STOREY REAR ADDITION TO CREATE 1X SELF CONTAINED STUDIO FLAT, INVOLVING REDUCTION OF GROUND FLOOR FLAT TO ACCOMODATE ACCESS TO THE UPPER LEVEL. ",
  "application_type": "All Other",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, scale, form and siting would constitute an unduly dominant extension and would represent an incongruous and unneighbourly form of development resulting in harm to the character of the host building and streetscene, and negative impact toward the amenity of neighbouring occupiers 70 Gorringe Park Avenue, 127 Tynemouth Road and existing flats at 72 Gorringe Park Avenue, in terms of outlook, privacy and light. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D3 and D4, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to provide an adequately private internal living environment for future occupiers with opportunities for direct overlooking from the first floor flat at 72 Gorringe Park Avenue. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policy D3 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would fail to provide a sufficient space for refuse storage with the access doors into the area swinging out onto the pavement obstructing the safe movement of pedestrians. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D3, SI 7 and SI 8, Merton LDF Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS17. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so at to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies SI 2 and SI 5, and Merton LDF Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 15.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
