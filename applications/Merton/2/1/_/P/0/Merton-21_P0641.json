    "Reason : 1 - By virtue of its excessive depth, the proposed ground floor extension would result in an unreasonable increased sense of enclosure toward the side return area of no. 2 Strathearn Road and would be visually dominant and lead to loss of light when viewed from the ground floor rear window at the bottom of the side return. In addition, the proposed ground floor extension would cause unreasonable loss of sunlight toward the rear facing ground floor window and patio area of no. 4 Strathearn Road. The proposal would therefore harm the amenity of nos. 2 and 4 Strathearn Road thereby contrary to policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
