    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The single storey side and rear extension, by reason of design, finish, position, scale, bulk and massing i) fails to respect the appearance, scale, bulk, proportions and character of the original building and ii) represents an unneighbourly form of development that is overly dominant, visually intrusive and harmful to outlook causing a loss of privacy and  a loss of daylight to gardens thereby having a detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
