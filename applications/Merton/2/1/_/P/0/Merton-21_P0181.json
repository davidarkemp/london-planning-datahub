    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of the buildings original construction date falling before 1st July 1948, would fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A.1 (c) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the additional storey floor to ceiling height exceeding that of the existing floor to ceiling heights of any other existing storeys, would fail to comply with Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A.1 (e)(ii) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of the loss of significant external amenity provision, would result in a detrimental impact to enjoyment of the existing resident's amenity, contrary to DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014. The proposal would therefore fail comply with Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A.2 (1)(g) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). "
