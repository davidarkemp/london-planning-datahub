  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due to its design, height, siting and massing would result in an incongruous and inappropriate form of development that would be visually dominant and intrusive, failing to complement the appearance of the existing building and neighbouring buildings. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D1, DM D2 and DMD3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan policy D2, D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development due to the position of external openings and rear balcony, as well as the height, depth and siting of the first floor extension, would result in a loss of privacy and create an overbearing and unneighbourly presence to the detriment of neighbour's living conditions. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that new dwellings are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T4, T6 of the London Plan, policy DM T1, DM T2 and DM T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant was informed of the issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome.\r\n\r\n",
