  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Design\r\nThe proposed development by reason of design, layout, siting, massing, height and insufficient public benefits would fail to achieve a high standard of design, resulting in an incongruous, unsympathetic and visually obtrusive form of overdevelopment, which has failed to respond appropriately to the context of the site and its surrounding, resulting in maximising the potential of the site rather than optimising its potential with an exemplary standard of design to justify tall buildings in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality as well as failing to preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the adjacent Wandle Valley Conservation Area and nearby listed buildings to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality and surrounding streetscape.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies D1, D3, D4, D6 and D9 of the London Plan 2021, DM D1 and DM D2 and DM D4 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policies CS 1 and CS 14 of Merton Core Strategy 2011 and the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 2 - Layout/Wind\r\nThe proposed development by reason of unsatisfactory siting, design, height, massing, layout and wind mitigation would fail to achieve a high standard of design, resulting in poor quality public realm and play space facilities and to the detriment of pedestrian and cycling safety, contrary to the Mayor's Vision Zero approach, the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies D3, D4, D5, D8, D9, S4, T1, T2 and T4 of the London Plan 2021, DM D1, DM D2, DM T1, DM T2 and DM T5 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policies CS 1, CS14 and CS 18 of Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Chapter 12 of the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 3 - Standard of Residential Accommodation \r\nThe proposed development by reason of lack of evidence to demonstrate an alternative design and layout has been explored to reduce the quantum of single aspect units represents over-intensification and over-development of the site failing to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, London Plan (2021) Policy D6, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS14, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) DMH5 and DM D2 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015). ",
    "Reason : 4 - Cycle Parking\r\nIn the absence of satisfactory access to the cycle parking facilities and substandard layout, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus failed to promote sustainable form of transport and inclusivity, contrary to, in particular, policies DM T1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 18 of Merton Core Strategy 2011  and GG1 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - Servicing/Delivery\r\nThe proposed development by reason of unsatisfactory Transport Assessment detailing updated trip generation rates and layout, would provide sub-standard delivery/servicing/maintenance arrangement for the residential and commercial units resulting in conflict of use within the public realm and adversely impact on the free flow of pedestrian and vehicular movement to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety within the site and on the surrounding public highway.? The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policies D3, D4, D8, D9, S4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM D1, DM D2, DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy Policies CS 14 and CS 20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Chapter 12 of the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 6 - Refuse/Recycling\r\nThe proposed development by reason of the sub-standard refuse & recycling arrangement and layout and reliance on private waste collector to collect residential refuse/recycling represent over intensification and overdevelopment of the site that would adversely impact on the visual amenity of the locality and proposed public realm and the free flow of traffic to the detriment of pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policies D3, D4, D8, S4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM D1, DM D2, DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy Policies CS 14, CS 17 and CS 20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Chapter 12 of the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 7 - Footpath\r\nBy reason of unsatisfactory footway widths along the southern boundary of the site adjoining the A24 Priory Road, the scheme fails to safeguard the pedestrian safety to the detriment of the free flow of traffic in the locality and highway and pedestrian safety.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policies D3, D4, D8, S4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM D1, DM D2, DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy Policies 14 and 20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Chapter 12 of the NPPF. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - Flooding\r\nThe proposed development by reason of inaccurate drawings, unsatisfactory finished floor levels and flood risk assessment/mitigation measures, the scheme fails to safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality and thus fails to accord with the criteria set out in, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 Policies DM F1, DM F2, Merton's Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, policies DM D2 and CS 16 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 9 - Ecology\r\nIn the absence of an up-to-date Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (original appraisal more than 2 years old), the applicant has failed to demonstrate the scheme safeguards ecological features and habitat in the locality and thus is considered to be to the detriment of the biodiversity in the Borough.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM D2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy G6 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 10 - Water usage statement \r\nIn the absence of a water usage statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.\r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - BREEAM\r\nBy reason of absence of evidence to demonstrate exceptional circumstances that the non-domestic floorspace cannot achieve at least a BREEAM \"very good\" standard the scheme fails to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 12 - Inclusive Access\r\nBy reason of absence of information addressing requirements of the provision of accessible and inclusive design, the scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of London Plan (2021) Policy D5. \r\n",
    "Reason : 13 - Health Impact\r\nBy reason of absence of a Health Impact Assessment and absence of a legal agreement to secure the necessary funding towards the provision health infrastructure to ensure the development does not place unreasonable pressure, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the health and wellbeing of the local communities contrary to, in particular, London Plan (2021) Policy GG3 of the London Plan.\r\n",
    "Reason : 14 - Carbon Off-set Funding\r\nIn the absence of legal agreement to secure the necessary carbon off-set funding, the scheme fails to provide a sustainable form of development.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies S12 of London Plan 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 15 - Circular Economy\r\nIn the absence of a satisfactory Circular Economy Statement, the scheme fails to recognise and promote the benefits of transition to a circular economy contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policies GG5 and SI7 and the GLA draft Circular Economy Statements Guidance (March 2020).\r\n",
    "Reason : 16 - Whole Life Carbon Lifecycle\r\nIn the absence of a Whole Life Carbon Life-cycle Assessment the scheme fails to demonstrate adequate actions have been taken to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions and thus fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan Policy SI 2.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 17 - Metropolitan Police\r\nBy reason of absence of a legal agreement to secure the necessary funding towards the provision and support of the Metropolitan Police Service to address the additional impacts of the proposal on the Metropolitan Police Service infrastructure, the scheme is contrary to, in particular, London Plan (2021) Policy D11.\r\n",
    "Reason : 18 - Parking Permit\r\nIn the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that all the residential units are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on-street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.\r\n",
    "Reason : 19 - Travel Plan\r\nIn the absence of a legal agreement securing a Travel Plan the scheme fails to promote sustainable and active travel to the detriment of the free flow of traffic in the locality contrary to, in particular, London Plan Policy T4.\r\n",
    "Reason : 20 - Bus Stop\r\nBy reason of unsatisfactory siting, design, length and layout of the relocated bus stop, the schemes fails to safeguard the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policies D3, D4, D8, S4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM D1, DM D2, DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy Policies 14 and 20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Chapter 12 of the NPPF. \r\n",
    "Reason : 21 - Street Trees\r\nIn the absence of a satisfactory landscaping plan and legal agreement to secure the CAVAT cost of the street trees to be removed as part of the proposal the scheme fails to safeguard the visual amenity of the locality and the health and longevity of all trees to the detriment of the biodiversity and ecological value of the borough.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies DM D2 and DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.\r\n",
    "Reason : 22 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
