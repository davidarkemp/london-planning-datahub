    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by virtue of its size, design and siting, would be visually intrusive, overbearing and result in an unacceptable level of daylight/sunlight loss and overshadowing, to the detriment of occupiers of No. 122 Somerset Road, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed side extension by virtue of its size, design, and siting, would result in an unacceptable reduction of the gap between the application property and No.122 Somserset Road, leading to a loss of spaciousness, views of greenery to the rear, and visual separation with No.122 Somerset Road to the detriment of the Newstead Way streetscene, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and Policy CS14 of the Core strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
