    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive height, bulk, massing and poor proportions, would have a detrimental impact on the appearance of the host building and the Leeward Gardens street scene contrary to Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA (enlargement of a dwellinghouse by construction of additional storeys) Condition AA.2 (3) (a) (ii) ( of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to provide existing elevations and the proposal is therefore in conflict with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class AA (enlargement of a dwellinghouse by construction of additional storeys) Procedure AA.3 (2) (c) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
