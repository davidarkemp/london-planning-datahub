    "Reason : 1 - The proposed solar panels, by virtue of their exposed position within the street scene, and their contrasting appearance with the prevailing traditional character of the surrounding built form and host dwelling, would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Wimbledon West Conservation Area. The proposal therefore falls contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D4 & HC1, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14, and Merton SPP (2014) Policies DMD2, DMD3 and DMD4. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
