    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nFollowing this refusal, you shall be reminded that you have an open enforcement case ref no 20/E0219 for the unauthourised use and activities on the land, should you not cease the B8 use, formal enforcement action will be taken. For more details please contact Luxmi.ghosh@merton.gov.uk",
    "Reason : 3 - The scheme, by reason of the introduction of Use Class B8 floorspace, increased pedestrian and vehicular movement, unsatisfactory and restricted access, absence of on-site parking, cycle and refuse stores and manoeuvre/turning area facilities, absence of waste, servicing and delivery management plan to include the frequency of vehicular movements and delivery, method of securing the access road and noise mitigation measures results in an unneighbourly form of development that adversely impacts on parking, the free flow of traffic to the detriment of pedestrian and vehicular safety along the access road.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies CS18 and CS20 of Core Strategy 2011 and DM E1 and DM D2 of Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and London Plan (2021) Policy E5."
