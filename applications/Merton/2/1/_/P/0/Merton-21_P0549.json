    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its width, design, size, scale and mass would result in an overbearing, visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that would dominate the form of the host building, reduce green space and outdoor amenity of the host building, harm the visual amenities of the streetscene and result in material harm to neighbouring amenity by way of a materially harmful overbearing effect, sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the rear garden of no.40 Furness Road. The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of LBM Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
