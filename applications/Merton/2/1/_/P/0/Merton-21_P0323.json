    "Reason : 1 - The scale, form, design, positioning and materials of the proposed first floor extension would appear dominant and unsympathetic, disrupting the original symmetry of building and composition of the terrace. The UVPC window would appear as a further incongruous element at first floor level, causing harm to the building's heritage value. The development therefore fails to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of building, the terrace and this part of the Lambton Road Conservation Area, contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D1, DM D2, DM D3, and DM D4, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan 2021 policy D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n",
