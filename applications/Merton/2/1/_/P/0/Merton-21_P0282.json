    "Reason : 2 - The size of the proposed outbuilding exceeds what may be reasonably considered as incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse. In addition, the intended use of the outbuilding is specified as ancillary in the application form. Therefore, it is considered that the proposal does not come within the terms of Class E of Part 1 of Schedule 2 (a) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
