    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension and rear roof terrace by reason of a combination of its excessive height, depth and siting would be visually intrusive, overbearing, cause overlooking and result in an unacceptable level of sense of enclosure to the detriment of the occupiers of No. 9 Cowdrey Road contrary to Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of future occupiers contrary to Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in one additional residential unit and the site is located in a controlled parking zone and there is no legal agreement in place for the unit to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS.20 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (July 2011), and policy DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
