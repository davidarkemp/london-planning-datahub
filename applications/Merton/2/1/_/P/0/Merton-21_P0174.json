    "Reason : 1 - By virtue of its excessive depth, the proposed single storey rear extension would result in material harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area contrary to London Plan policies D1 and D4, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3. ",
    "Reason : 2 - By virtue of its close proximity to the southern boundary and elevated position, the proposed external staircase and access door would result in material harm via overlooking to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers at number 12 Hamilton Road contrary to London Plan policies D1 and D4, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2.",
