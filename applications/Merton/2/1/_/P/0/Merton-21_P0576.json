    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, depth, scale, and massing represents an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive resulting in a sense of enclosure would be materially harmful to the amenity of  the neighbouring occupier no. 65 Haydon Park Road. The development is therefore contrary to policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) which seeks to protect the amenity of adjacent occupiers.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\nIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\t\r\nThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
