    "Reason : 1 - The application site is located partially within the curtilage of the ruins of Merton Priory, a scheduled monument, and therefore fails to comply with A.1 (o) (iv) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A 'New dwellinghouses on detached blocks of flats' General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The application site is or forms part of land situated within a 3km radius of the perimeter of an aerodrome (St Georges Hospital, Blackshaw Road, London SW17 0QT) which is used by aircraft engaged in the public transport of passengers, and therefore fails to comply with A.1 (o) (vii) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A  'New dwellinghouses on detached blocks of flats' General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The Pickle Ditch is a partially culverted waterway that crosses the site and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the works will not impact the integrity of the culvert without the need for strengthening the existing foundations. Consequently the proposal can not be considered as under para (j) development under Class A.(a) would consist of engineering operations other than works within the existing curtilage of the building to (ii)strengthen existing foundations.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development by reason of its height, scale, bulk, proportions and appearance fails to; i) respect the form, scale, bulk and proportions of the original building and ii) to enhance the local context and contribute positively to the character and appearance of the wider built environment contrary to London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies  DMD1, DMD2 & DM D3 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS14",
    "Reason : 5 - The size, siting and design of the proposed development would represent an overly dominant, visually intrusive and unneighbourly form of development that would result in overshadowing and a loss of light, privacy and outlook to the material detriment of the amenity of neighbouring residents contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D3, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 6 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that i) the proposed development will not adversely affect the structural stability of the culvert that encompasses a large section of the site and ii) that flood risk will not be increased elsewhere as a result of the proposed development, contrary to Para 159 of the NPPF 2019 and policy SI 12 of the London Plan 2021.
