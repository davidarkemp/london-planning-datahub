    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion of the property into two self-contained units, by reason of each flat's internal floor areas, would adversely impact upon the amenity of any future occupiers, due to failing to meet the minimum floor areas for a three-bed, five-person flat and a two-bed, three-person flat. Furthermore, each of five total bedrooms fail to meet the minimum standards for single and double bedrooms. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
