    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Proposed 1/F Plan; Proposed Elevation; Proposed Rear Elevation; Proposed Roof Plan. ",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no window, door or other opening other than those expressly authorised by this permission shall be constructed on the first floor western elevation of 59 Denison Road facing toward 57 Denison Road, or on the first floor eastern elevation of 61 Denison Road facing toward 63 Denison Road, without planning permission first being obtained from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 5 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied, the first floor windows in the western and eastern elevations shall be glazed with obscure glass and fixed shut up to 1.7m measured from the internal floor level, and shall permanently maintained as such thereafter.",
    "Condition : 6 - The first floor rear extensions approved for the dwellings, 59 and 61 Denison Road, shall both need to be constructed and completed in accordance with the submitted plans in order to fully comply with this planning permission. So, until the extension is complete at 59 Denison Road, the works at 61 Denison Road would remain unlawful (enforcement ref: 19/E0584).\r\n\r\nReason:  To ensure that the development proposed results in a co-ordinated and balanced built form, and to comply with policies CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011, DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's SPP Plan 2014 and D4 of the London Plan 2021. The works would not be acceptable without this condition in place given that that development to one property only would result in a visually intrusive and dominant flank elevation toward 59 Denison Road. ",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nThe applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building. Further information is available at the following link: \r\nhttp://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/buildingpolicyandlegislation/current legislation/partywallact\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay."
