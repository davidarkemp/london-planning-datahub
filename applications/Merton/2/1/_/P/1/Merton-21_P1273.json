    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear roof extension (involving raising the ridge height by 250mm), first floor rear extension and roof terrace, by virtue of design, character and appearance, would harm the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by virtue of its scale, height and design, would have a harmful impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties through an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and loss of privacy and therefore fails to comply with Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM D2.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' development, the proposals would generate additional parking pressure in the area and would be contrary to policies DM T2 and DM T3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy CS 20 of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011).
