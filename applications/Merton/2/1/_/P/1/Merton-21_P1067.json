    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of size, design and layout fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers of both proposed units. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DM D2, London Plan 2021 policy D6 and the DCLG Technical Housing Space Standards 2015",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed alterations to the roof form, front infill extension and layout by reason of design, size and siting fail to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, rhythm, scale, proportions, height and massing of the existing and surrounding buildings and to the character of the local area contrary to the principles of policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted SPP 2014 and CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of design, siting, layout and lack of defensible space would fail to protect the privacy and amenity of the occupiers of the ground floor unit contrary to the principles of policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policy DM D2 of the Adopted SPP 2014 and CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
