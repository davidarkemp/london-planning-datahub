  "description": "CHANGE OF USE FROM A SINGLE DWELLINGHOUSE (CLASS C3) TO A DAY NURSERY (CLASS E(F)).",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in the loss of a family-sized residential dwelling for which insufficient justification has been given and a need for the proposed day care facility has not been adequately demonstrated.  As such, the proposed change of use is considered contrary to Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS9 and the London Plan (2021) Policy H8.   ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its proposed change of use, would result in the increase of noise levels at the site, which in the absence of a noise impact assessment would have the potential to be harmful to the amenity of the surrounding residential occupiers. This would be contrary to Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMC1, DMD2, DMEP2, DMR4 and the London Plan (2021) Policies D13 and D14.   ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal has not provided adequate provisions for refuse storage and collection and is therefore contrary with Merton LDF Core Strategy (2011) policy CS 17. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development fails to provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the vehicle movement likely to be generated by the proposed use could suitably be accommodated without detriment to the local on-street parking availability, congestion, road and pedestrian safety. This would be contrary to Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DMT2, London Plan (2021) Policy T4 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) Policies CS18 and CS20.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
