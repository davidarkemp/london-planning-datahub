  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive height, bulk, massing and siting would be visually intrusive, overbearing, and result in an unacceptable level of privacy and daylight/sunlight loss, to the detriment of the detriment of neighbouring occupiers on Birkbeck Road, Barton Mews and Cowdrey Road, contrary to Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of future occupiers contrary to Policies DM D2 of the Councils adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development is an unsatisfactory design, which is excessive in terms of height, bulk and massing, and is out of character with the surrounding area. The proposal would also result in an overdevelopment of the site contrary to policies DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would result in 4 net additional residential units and the site is located in a controlled parking zone and there is no legal agreement in place for the units to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS.20 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (July 2011), and policy DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
