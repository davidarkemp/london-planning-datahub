Planning permission would therefore be required.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side and rear extension, by reason of its mass and proximity to the boundary of the site, would be harmful to the residential amenity of the neighbouring dwellings. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
