    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the design, layout,  number of bedrooms, and associated potential occupancy, would result in an unneighbourly overdevelopment and intensification of the use of the site, resulting in a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers by reason of substandard communal facilities and adequate security arrangements and would likely be harmful to the residential character and amenities of the existing property and the surrounding area by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM H5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policies D3, D6 & D11 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of safeguarding the amenities of the area and neighbouring occupiers by providing sufficient refuse and recycling facilities and would be contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policy CS17 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
