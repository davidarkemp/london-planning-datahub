    "Reason : 1 - The proposed house by reason of its size and siting would be visually incongruous in the Wilton Crescent street scene, whilst not conserving or enhancing the character and appearance of the Merton (John Innes - Wilton Crescent) Conservation Area contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D4 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to provide an adequate sized dwelling and private usable amenity space, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and policy D6 of the London Plan (March 2021).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in one additional residential unit, whilst the site is located in a controlled parking zone and there is no legal agreement in place for the proposed unit to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS.20 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (July 2011), and policy DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
