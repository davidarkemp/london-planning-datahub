    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension and box dormer windows (involving raising the ridge height by 250mm), by virtue of its design, character and appearance, would harm the character and appearance of the host properties and surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). Accordingly, it is recommended to refuse permission. "
