    "Reason : 1 - The proposed terrace, by reason of the vantage points that it would create, would be harmful to the residential amenity of the neighbouring properties to the east, west and to the ground floor flat below the host flat, due to the proximity of the terrace to these areas. In addition, the proposed roof terrace by reason of its size and proximity to neighbouring windows would result in material harm to neighbouring amenity by way of noise disturbance The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
