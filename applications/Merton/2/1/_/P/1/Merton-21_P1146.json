    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due to its scale, design and siting, would appear visually dominant, and be an overly intensive form of development, at odds with this part of the site's garden character. The development would therefore have a harmful effect on the character and appearance of the host site and neighbouring area, contrary to policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development due to its scale, siting and design would appear visually intrusive and overbearing, creating an unneighbourly relationship with adjacent properties. Views from loft windows would lead to a loss of privacy for neighbouring properties including both their garden spaces and rear habitable rooms. The development would therefore be contrary to DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
