    "Reason : 2 - The proposed refuse collection arrangements by reason of the drag distance\r\nbetween storage and collection points would be excessive, inconvenient,\r\nimpractical and would detract from the quality of environment for future occupiers, contrary to Merton Core Strategy Policy CS17 and London Plan policy D6.\r",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that adequate tree protection or\r\nmitigation measures would be delivered as part of any development contrary to Sites and Policies Plan DMO2 and London Plan 2021 policy G7.",
