    "Reason : 1 - The proposals, by reason of its design, scale, form and massing, would represent an unduly dominant and bulky addition which would be visually prominent from the surrounding streetview; and it would erode the symmetry and rhythm currently enjoyed at the rear of the terrace dwellings. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
