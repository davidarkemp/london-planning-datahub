    "Condition : 1 - This consent shall expire 5 years from the date of this decision.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Proposed Plans",
    "Condition : 3 - No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military), obscure or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle.",
    "Condition : 4 - Any advertisement displayed, and any site used for the display of advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.",
    "Condition : 5 - Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not endanger the public.",
    "Condition : 6 - Where an Advertisement is required under these Regulations to be removed, the site shall be left in a condition that does not endanger the public or impair visual amenity.",
    "Condition : 7 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its location and size, does not accord with the obligation to create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible which promote health and well-being and high standards of amenity for existing and future users. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM D5 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021 and Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021."
