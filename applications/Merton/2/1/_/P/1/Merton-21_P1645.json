    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans:\r\n21004-013 - Proposed Site Plan;\r\n21004-012 - Proposed Block Plan;\r\n21004-022 - Proposed First Floor Plan;\r\n21004-017 - Proposed Front Elevation;\r\n21004-014 - Proposed Ground Floor Plan;\r\n21004-018 - Proposed Rear Elevation;\r\n21004-016 - Proposed Roof Plan;\r\n21004-019 - Proposed Side B Elevation.",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied, the window in the first floor south west side elevation shall be glazed with obscure glass and fixed shut and shall permanently maintained as such thereafter.",
    "Condition : 5 - The development approved under this application along with the development approved under planning application ref. 21/P0232, shall be implemented at the same time and shall be fully completed as one operation.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development proposed results in a co-ordinated built form, and therefore to comply with policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014. The works would not be acceptable without this condition, given that development to first floor only would leave the ground floor appearing incomplete.",
    "Condition : 6 - The applicant should be aware that the site may provide a useful habitat for swifts. Swifts are currently in decline in the UK and in order to encourage and improve the conservation of swifts the applicant is advised to consider the installation of a swift nesting box/bricks on the site.",
    "Condition : 7 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n"
