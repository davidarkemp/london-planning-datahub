The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",

You are advised to complete the development in full accordance with the plans, as if the development is larger than that covered by this Certificate a breach of planning control could result. Should you adjoin this development to that approved under 20/P1717 then planning permission would be required."
