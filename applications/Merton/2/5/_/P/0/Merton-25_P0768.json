  "site_name": null,
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - y reason of absence of sufficient and consistent drawings to satisfactorily confirm the design and dimensions of the rear dormer roof extension, the scheme is not considered to safeguard the character and appearance of the host dwelling or the residential amenity of nearby occupants.  As such, the proposal fails to demonstrate that it complies with, in particular, policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy D12.1, D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Merton Local Plan (2024)",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed raised ridge by reason of its siting and design would disrupt the established roofline of the terrace and result in a visually incongruous form of development that fails to respect the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the visual amenity of the locality. The proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy D12.1, D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Merton Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of use of inappropriate materials at roof level, the scheme results in an unsympathetic, bulky and incongruous form of development that fails to respect the use of traditional roofing materials in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the site and surrounding.   The proposal therefore fails to respect the established roofscape character and would conflict with, in particular,  the following policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy D12.1, D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Merton Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
