  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of its inappropriate location and unsympathetic design is visually intrusive and results in an unacceptable loss of outlook to the detriment of occupiers of Nos. 20 and 21 Ashbourne Terrace. In addition, it has not been possible to assess the impact of the development on noise and odour due to the lack of details submitted. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies D12.3, D12.4, and P15.01 of the Merton Local Plan 2024 - 2037/38.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
