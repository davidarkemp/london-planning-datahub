    "Reason : 1 - The siting, design and appearance would be out of character and incongruent and cause harm when viewed in relation to the original dwelling and in relation to the surrounding Conservation Area. Accordingly, the proposal would conflict with NPPF, London Plan policy HC1 and Merton Local Plan policy D12.5 due to the harm caused to the significance of the Conservation Area.",
    "Reason : 2 - The siting and design would cause harm when viewed in relation to the original dwelling and in relation to dwellings in the locality. Therefore the proposal would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area contrary to Merton Local Plan policy D12.3 and D12.3",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n"
