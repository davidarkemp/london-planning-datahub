    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of siting and design results in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to preserve the evident uniformity of the bay windows along the Consfield Avenue street to the detriment and visual amenity of the locality. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with National Planning Policy Framework Chapters 4 and 12, London Plan 2021 policies D3 and D4, Merton Local Plan 2024 policies D12.1, D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development and a drainage strategy, the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, Chapters 4, 12 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, Strategic Policy F15.7 Flood Risk Management and Sustainable Drainage and Policies F15.8 and F15.9 of Merton's Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
