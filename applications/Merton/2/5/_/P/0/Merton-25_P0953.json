  "site_name": null,
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The operations would consist of the enlargement of a dwelling house within the meaning of Class B of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class B. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development is only just within Permitted Development tolerances in terms of volume. You are advised to complete the development in full accordance with the plans, as if the development is larger than that covered by this Certificate a breach of planning control could result.",
    "Reason : 1 - The  Failure to Submit the Main Roof  Volume Calculations results  by reason of  in Sufficient Information  submitted and in Calculation the Total Volume of the Main Roof Pluse the Volume of the Extended and Conversion of the Outrigger 36.68 cubic meters when you add the Main Roof Volume  to the Total Volume  of 40 Cubic Meters would exceed the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. Planning Permission would therefore be required..",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF 2024  as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\nThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF2024 , and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The Proposed Lawful Development Certitifacate is Considered Not Lawful by Reason of the Failure of The Applicant not submitting the Main Roof Volume Calcutions results in insufficient Information for the Overall Volume Calcutions of this Terreaced Dwellinghouse and The Main Roof Volume forms part of the Roof Loft Conversion of this Terrace Dwelling and the Main Roof Volume must be added to the Outrigger Volume before the Application can be Assessed Lawful if the Main Roof Volume Pluse the Outrigger Volume added together is under 40 Cubic Meters in Total .
