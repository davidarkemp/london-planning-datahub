    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey extension by reason of its combined scale, massing, bulk, and width would fail to achieve a high standard of design, being out of keeping, unduly dominant and unsympathetic to the appearance, scale, bulk, proportions and character of the original building and the wider area contrary to policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy D12.1, D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Merton Local Plan (2024).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
