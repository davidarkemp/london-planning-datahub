  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions would by reason of their design, size, bulk and siting, be an unduly dominant and inappropriate form of development, unsympathetic to the appearance of the existing and neighbouring properties and would result in the loss of the symmetrical nature of the terrace as well as the visual gap between the houses, features that contribute to the character of the conservation area, thereby failing to conserve and enhance the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area and would be contrary to London Plan (2021) policy HC 1 and policies D12.4 and D12.5 of the Merton Local Plan (2024).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n \r\nThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n"
