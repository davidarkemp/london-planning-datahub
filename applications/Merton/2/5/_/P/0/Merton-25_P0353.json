This is because Officers cannot make a determination as to whether the proposed single storey rear extension would comply with the provisions of the conditions, limitations or restrictions application to development permitted by Class A which exceeds the limits in paragraph A1(f) but is allowed by paragraph A.1(g) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r\n\r\n",
