    "Reason : 1 - The proposed cumulative impact of the roof additions, particularly the provision of a front dormer by reason of its design, height, scale, bulk and form would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would increase bulk and massing at roof level. Additionally the front dormer would appear awkward and jarring in the streetscene, failing to blend and integrate well with the main building and its existing roofscape and would have a negative impact toward the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of Merton Local Plan 2024 and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice \r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nShould the applicant/agent wish to submit a subsequent application they are reminded to include all works in the development description and include all elevations including the rear one. It is noted that the rear dormer differs from the consented lawful development certificate 25/P0119"
