  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its combined bulk, massing, design (including use of incongruous material), appearance and introduction of roof terrace, the proposal results in a discordant, cramped and contrived form of development that fails to be in keeping with the character and appearance of the site and surrounding to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality, contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan and Policy D12.3 of the Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of combined bulk, mass, height, depth and proximity to the shared boundary, the proposed dwelling would result in an visually obtrusive and dominant form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities nearby occupants, in particular, the occupiers of no.69 by way of loss of outlook, unreasonable sense of enclosure and overbearing form to the rear garden area, contrary to, in particular, Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policies D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of substandard layout and sized double bedroom, the limited outlook from the proposed dwelling and amenity areas and the restricted access to the bin and cycle store, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site failing to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies T5 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, polices H11.1 and D12.3 of the Merton Local Plan 2024 and the National Described Space Standards.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of a noise and vibration impact assessment including necessary mitigation measures, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed use of Air Source Heat Pump would safeguard the residential amenity of the future occupiers of the proposed unit and the nearby occupants in terms of noise and vibration.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policy D12.1 of Merton Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a Biodiversity Net Gain Statement incorporating aerial images of the site, marked up to show existing and proposed development areas, and how that accords with the exemption criteria claimed, together with photographs of the current site conditions, the scheme fails to comply with requirements set out in, in particular, the Environment Act 2021, The Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Exemptions) Regulations 2024 and Merton Local Plan Policy O15.3.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of the scheme failing to achieve Zero Carbon and the absence of a legal agreement to secure the required carbon offset fund the scheme fails to provide a sustainable and energy efficient scheme contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policy CC2.2 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n"
