  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension with gabled roof work and rear dormer, by reason of their combined width, massing and design would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, unsympathetic, incongruous and cramped form of overdevelopment that fails to relate to the character, appearance, form and proportion of the host building, the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding street scene and area in general. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, London Plan policies D3 and D4 and Merton Local Plan policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Fire Safety Strategy incorporating but not limited to a plan detailing appropriate positioning of fire appliances and appropriate evacuation assembly points the scheme fails to provide a safe form of development for future users contrary to, in particular, Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
