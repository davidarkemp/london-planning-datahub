    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front dormer roof extension facing Hartfield Road would be overbearing and incongruous and cause harm to the existing building and the streetscene along Hartfield Road contrary to Merton Local Plan (MLP) 2024-2037/28 Policy D12.3 (Ensuring high quality design for all developments); Policy D12.4 (Alterations and extensions to existing building), and the NPPF 2024.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
