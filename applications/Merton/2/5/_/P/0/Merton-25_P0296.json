    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of a family sized unit (6b 6p minimum), thereby failing to comply with policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan 2024 ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of unsatisfactory layout would create a poor standard of internal environment for occupiers of the C4 HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policy D12.3 of Merton's Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 3 - The development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to policy T16.2 of  Merton?s Local Plan 2024 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of adequate refuse and recycling storage facilities for the development, the applicant has not demonstrated that the scheme would not adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and result in material harm to the visual amenity  of the area.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4, SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021,  Merton Local Plan 2024 policy D12.2, D12.3 and W14.4.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a fire safety strategy, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would provide the highest standard of fire safety, thereby failing to comply with policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of unclear parking provision/implication of increase of on-site parking, the proposal appears to increase on-site parking as well as parking within the locality. As such the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy T16.2 of Merton's Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 7 - Due to the increase of on-site parking, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
