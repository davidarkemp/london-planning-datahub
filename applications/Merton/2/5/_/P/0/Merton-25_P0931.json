DEMOLITION OF EXISTING SIDE EXTENSION AND ERECTION OF A DOUBLE STOREYS SIDE EXTENSION. DEMOLITION OF EXISTING FIRST FLOOR REAR EXTENSION AND ERECTION OF FIRST FLOOR REAR EXTENSION. REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING SASH WINDOWS WITH DOUBLE GLAZED SASH WINDOWS TO MATCH EXISTING. PROPOSED HIGH QUALITY BINS AND BIKES ENCLOSURE TO FRONT GARDEN. NEW ROOF TILES TO MATCH EXISTING.",
  "site_name": null,
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension would fill the gap between the houses which is a defining characteristic of this part of Gladstone Road. Also, the extension would fill a gap between a hipped roof house and a gable roofed house which would appear odd within the road, and have metal cladding which would be out of keeping with the traditional character of the host property and surrounding ones. The character and appearance of the road would therefore be adversely affected to the detriment of visual amenity. As such the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Merton Local Plan 2024. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
