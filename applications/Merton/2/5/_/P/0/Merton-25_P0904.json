  "site_name": null,
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of a family sized unit, thereby failing to comply with policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals fail to provide adequate communal kitchen facilities for ten occupiers and demonstrate the space is fit for use. As a result, the proposal would result in an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers for the large HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D6 and Merton Local Plan 2024 policy D12.3",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the number of bedrooms and associated occupancy and absence of justification or mitigation or management would give rise to an intensification of the use of the site, and thus would have the potential to be harmful to the residential character and amenities of neighbouring occupiers and by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policy H16 of the London Plan 2021; Policies D12.3 and H11.5 of Merton's Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 4 - The scheme with no additional onsite parking and by reason of absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy T16.1 of Merton's Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of the proposals impacting in excess of 25sqm of on-site habitat and absence of provision of a minimum 10% gain in biodiversity from the development, the scheme fails to comply with the requirements set out in the Environment Act 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
