    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a fire safety strategy, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would provide the highest standard of fire safety, thereby failing to comply with policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a fire safety strategy, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would provide the highest standard of fire safety, thereby failing to comply with policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 8 - By reason of the absence of an energy statement (demonstrating that the scheme would achieve a 100% improvement on Part L, Building regulations 2021), absence of  information to demonstrate water usage rates and absence of information relating to ventilation or overheating, the applicant has failed to demonstrate compliance with, in particular, Policies CC2.1, CC2.2, CC2.3, CC2.4 CC2.5 and CC2.6 of Merton's Local Plan 2024 and London Plan policies SI2 and SI4..",
