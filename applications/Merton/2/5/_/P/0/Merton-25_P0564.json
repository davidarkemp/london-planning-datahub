  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of a family sized unit (5b 6p minimum), thereby failing to comply with policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan 2024 ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of substandard room sizes, layout and lack of communal spaces, including a substandard WC, would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers for the large HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D6 and Merton Local Plan 2024 policy D12.3",
    "Reason : 3 - The scheme with no additional onsite parking, by reason of absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy T16.1 of Merton's Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of satisfactory and convenient access to cycle storage facilities, the scheme is contrary to policy T16.2 of  Merton�s Local Plan 2024 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of adequate refuse and recycling storage facilities for the development, and due to the refuse store doors opening over the public highway (footway), the applicant has not demonstrated that the scheme would not adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and result in material harm to the visual amenity  of the area.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4, SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021,  Merton Local Plan 2024 policy D12.2, D12.3 and W14.4.",
    "Reason : 6 - The applicant has failed to provide biodiversity measures, thereby failing to comply the objectives set out in G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposal, by reason of the number of bedrooms and associated occupancy and management strategy, would give rise to an intensification of the use of the site, safety and security measures for future residents and thus would have the potential to be harmful to the residential character and amenities of neighbouring occupiers and by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policy H16 of the London Plan 2021; Policies D12.3 and H11.5 of Merton's Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice\r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nThe applicant/agent is reminded that the proposal can only be assessed against national policies, the London Plan 2021 and Merton Council's policies and guidances."
