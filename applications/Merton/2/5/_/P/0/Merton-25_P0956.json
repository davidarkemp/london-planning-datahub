    "Condition : 1 - Commencement of development (Full Permission) - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - Approved Plans - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: [2446_PL_501,\r\n2446_PL_502,\r\n2446_PL_503,\r\n2446_PL_504]",
    "Condition : 3 - Materials as Specified - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - No Use of Flat Roof  - Access to the flat roof of the development hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 5 - The development hereby approved shall implement the flood mitigation measures as submitted with the proposal titled: Flood Risk Assessment. These measures shall thereafter be retained in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nReason:  To reduce the risk of flooding and to comply with the following Local Plan 2024 policies for Merton: F15.7 and F15.8",
    "Condition : 6 - The development hereby approved shall implement the fire safety measures as submitted with the proposal titled: Fire Safety Strategy. These measures shall thereafter be retained in perpetuity. \r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that the development complies with policy D12 of the London Plan 2021",

Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4.

    "Condition : 9 - Informative - Both prior approval applications, LBM Ref 24/P2694 and 24/P3617 seek to convert the same section of the ground floor (space adjacent to the rear window). Therefore, both approvals cannot be implemented simultaneously as neither permission would be in accordance with the approved plans. Either LBM Ref 24/P2694 and 24/P3617 would need to be implemented independently. \r\n\r\nThe applicant is reminded of planning condition 3 of LBM Ref 24/P3617 requiring confirmation of which permission is to be implemented.\r\n\r\nCondition 3 - Notwithstanding the approval of the two prior approval applications on this site in relation to the part change of use from betting shop (sui generis use) to residential (C3 use) to provide 1 x studio flat, only one application shall be implemented. Prior to the commencement of any \r\ndevelopment, the applicant must notify the local planning authority in writing of the chosen application to be implemented. No development shall commence until written confirmation of the chosen application has been received from the local planning authority.Any further changes to the ground floor layout and use may therefore need additional approvals. \r\n\r\nPlease note any breaches in planning can be subject of enforcement action.\r",
    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE (Party Wall Act) - The applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building.
