    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its combined siting, design and depth results in a dominant, unsympathetic, incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that fails to respect the appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling to the detriment of the visual amenity of the terrace row that its forms a part of and the surrounding character.  The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of, in particular, policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its combined siting, depth and height results in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and potentially impact on daylight/sunlight and create overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 195 and 199 Stanford Road.  The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of, in particular, policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed dormer roof extension, owing to its design, siting and loss of eaves results in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host property and terrace in which it forms part of. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, polices D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a Fire Safety Strategy incorporating but not limited to a plan detailing appropriate positioning of fire appliances and appropriate evacuation assembly points the scheme fails to provide a safe form of development for future users contrary to, in particular, Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice .\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
