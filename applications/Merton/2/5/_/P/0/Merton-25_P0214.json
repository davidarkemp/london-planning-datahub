  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, depth and height is considered to represent an overbearing, visually intrusive and dominant form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and potentially cause unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular No. 49 Lower Morden Lane. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, policies D12.3 of the Merton Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 2 -  The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, design, height, width, scale, massing, bulk, height and use of inappropriate materials results in a visually intrusive, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to achieve a high standard of design destroying the form, proportion and appearance of the host dwelling and the appearance of the semi-detached pair that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, and policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Merton Local Plan 2024.",

    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
