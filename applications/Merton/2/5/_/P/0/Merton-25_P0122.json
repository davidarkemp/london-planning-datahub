  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of a family sized unit (3b 4p minimum), thereby failing to comply with policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan 2024 ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of insufficient layout and fully furnished floor plans, as well as the lack of information/justification for the lounge at ground floor and an office at roof level, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site which has the potential to provide sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme thereby fails to meet the requirements of, in particular, policies D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policy D12.3 of the Merton's Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 3 - The development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to policy T16.2 of  Merton�s Local Plan 2024 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of adequate refuse and recycling storage facilities for the development, the applicant has not demonstrated that the scheme would not adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and result in material harm to the visual amenity  of the area.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4, SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021,  Merton Local Plan 2024 policy D12.2, D12.3 and W14.4.",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would minimise water use and CO2 emissions as well as include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
