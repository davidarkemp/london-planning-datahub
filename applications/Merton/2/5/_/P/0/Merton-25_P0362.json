    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part single/part two storey rear extension by reason of its combined siting, design and depth results in a dominant, unsympathetic, incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that fails to respect the appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling to the detriment of the visual amenity of the immediate streetscene that it forms a part of and the surrounding character. The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of, in particular, policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice \r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
