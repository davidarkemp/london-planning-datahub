The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 2 - INFORMATIVE: The applicant is reminded that this certificate of lawfulness had been issued on the basis that the outbuilding will be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse only. This certificate does not permit the use of the outbuilding for primary living accommodation or as a self contained residential unit. Any use falling outside the scope of 'incidental' would potentially render the use unlawful and subject to enforcement action. "
