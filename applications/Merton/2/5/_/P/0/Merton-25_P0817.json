    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of insufficient width to facilitate the creation of a front garden parking space would result in a poor and impractical form of development that would encourage unlawful parking on public highway to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal fails to demonstrate it would comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan 2021 policies D3, D4, T4 and T6, and Merton Local Plan 2024 policies S12.1, D12.2, D12.3 T.16.3 and T16.4.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of loss of existing on-street parking and potential increase in reverse actions onto St Helier Avenue, an A-Classified Road, the proposal fails to provide a safe form of development and would thus adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The proposal fails to demonstrate it would comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan 2021 policies T4 and T6, and Merton Local Plan 2024 policies T16.3 and T16.4.",

    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
