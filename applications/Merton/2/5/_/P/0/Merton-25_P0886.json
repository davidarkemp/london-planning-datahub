    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the existing use as a C4 small HMO is lawful. In the absence of a valid planning permission or a certificate of lawfulness to confirm the lawful implementation of C4 use, the existing lawful use of the property remains a single family dwellinghouse (C3). The development would result in the loss of a family sized unit, thereby failing to comply with policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of substandard room size, particularly bedroom 4, would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D6 and Merton Local Plan 2024 policy D12.3",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that the kitchen/living/dining area would provide sufficient space and facilities to meet the needs of ten occupiers. No furnished layout drawings have been provided as such it is unclear whether the space could accommodate adequate cooking, dining and living facilities contrary to London Plan 2021 Policy D6 and Policy H4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal, by reason of the number of bedrooms and associated occupancy and absence of justification or mitigation or management would give rise to an intensification of the use of the site, and thus would have the potential to be harmful to the residential character and amenities of neighbouring occupiers and by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policy H16 of the London Plan 2021; Policies D12.3 and H11.5 of Merton's Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to limit the parking permit to 1 residential car parking permit within the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, T16.1, T16.3 and T16.4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021"
