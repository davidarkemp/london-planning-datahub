    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of evidence to demonstrate that an equivalent scheme cannot be provided elsewhere in the Borough to achieve the same benefits on an alternative site that is not designated as Strategic Industrial Land and absence of supporting evidence to indicate that the EV charging hub would primarily serve businesses within the Strategic Industrial Land the proposal would fail to safeguard the continued use of land for purposes falling within industrial uses and permanent loss of Strategic Industrial Land contrary to Policy E5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies EC13.1 and EC13.2 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of absence of visual enhancements in the form of planting/soft landscaping the proposal fails to provide a positive contribution to the visual amenity of the locality contrary to, in particular, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy D12.3 of the Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of satisfactory security and surveillance measures to reduce opportunities for anti-social behaviour, the proposals would fail to create a safe and secure environment for all, in conflict with, in particular, Policies D3 and D11 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy D12.2 of the Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes. \r\n\"\tThe agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
