    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would by reason of its design, size, bulk, materials and siting, be an unduly dominant and visually discordant form of development, that would fail to; a) respect the form, scale, bulk, proportions and materials of the original building whilst the roof form would fail to respect the prevailing positive characteristics of the area and b) fail to enhance local context by positively responding to local distinctiveness through scale, appearance and shape that would reflect the best elements of the character of the surrounding area, or have sufficient distinctive merit so that the development would contribute positively to the character and appearance of the built environment. The proposals would therefore be contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D3 and policies D12.1, D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Merton Local Plan (2024). ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\n Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
