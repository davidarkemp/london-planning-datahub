  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of a family sized unit (5b 6p minimum), thereby failing to comply with policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan 2024 ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of unsatisfactory layout would create a poor standard of internal environment for occupiers of the C4 HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policy D12.3 of Merton's Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 3 - The development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to policy T16.2 of  Merton�s Local Plan 2024 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a fire safety strategy, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would provide the highest standard of fire safety, thereby failing to comply with policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice \r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
