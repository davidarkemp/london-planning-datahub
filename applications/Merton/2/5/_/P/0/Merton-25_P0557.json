    "Reason : 1 - Overall, Officers consider the proposed development would fail to comply with policy, notably MLP policy D12.3 (g) in respect of neighbouring amenity by reason of unacceptable impact on outlook and privacy of surrounding properties notably the outlook of 59-69 Sydney  Road and 62-70 Dupont Road, and the privacy and perception of privacy at 59-69 Sydney  Road.",
    "Reason : 2 - Overall, Officers consider the proposed development would fail to comply with policy notably MLP policy D12.3 and D12.3 in respcect of character, and design in that it fails to by sympathetic to the pattern of development in the locality and fails to respond positively to the siting, rhythm, scale, density, proportions, height, materials and massing of surrounding buildings and existing street patterns, historic context and urban layout.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"               The Applicant was given pre-application advice consistent with this decision.\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.  \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. .\r\n\r\n"
