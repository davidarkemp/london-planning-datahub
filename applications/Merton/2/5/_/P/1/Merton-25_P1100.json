The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",

This certificate does not permit the use of the outbuilding for primary living accommodation or as a self contained residential unit. Any use falling outside the scope of 'incidental' would potentially render the use unlawful and subject to enforcement action.",

If you are in any doubt about this you can get further information via https://www.merton.gov.uk/planning-and-buildings/building-control  or by emailing building.control@merton.gov.uk.\r\n"
