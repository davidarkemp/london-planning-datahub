    "Reason : 1 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason:\r\n\r\nBy reason of absence of proposed materials officers are unable to ascertain whether the proposed single storey rear extension would be of similar appearance to  those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse, the proposed single storey rear extension enlargement would fail to comply with para A.3(a) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and consequently Prior Approval is Required and Refused.\r\n",

As such, the proposed single storey rear extension would fail to comply with the provisions of the conditions, limitations or restrictions application to development permitted by Class A which exceeds the limits in paragraph A1(f) but is allowed by paragraph A.1(g) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
