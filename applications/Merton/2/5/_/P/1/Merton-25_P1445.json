    "Reason : 2 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason: In the absence of proposed materials it cannot be determined if the proposed materials would be similar in appearance to the existing dwellinghouse, therefore the proposal would not accord with condition A.3(a) of Class A Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason:\r\nIn the absence of proposed drawings it cannot be ascertained if the proposal by reason of its scale, bulk, form and massing, would be overbearing, unduly dominant and visually intrusive; resulting in an unacceptable loss of light, outlook and increased sense of enclosure toward the adjoining/adjacent properties, therefore the proposal would not accord with A.4 (7) and (9) of Class A Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n"
