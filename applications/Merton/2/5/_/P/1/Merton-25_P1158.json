  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side/rear extension by reason of its unacceptable combined siting, width and height would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous and dominant form of development that fails to relate to the character, appearance, form and proportion of the host property and would appear out of keeping in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the site and surrounding. The proposal would therefore not comply with, in particular, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side extension development, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 35 Bramcote Avenue. The proposal would be in conflict with, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development and a drainage strategy, the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, Policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, Policy F15.7 and F15.8 of the Merton Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
