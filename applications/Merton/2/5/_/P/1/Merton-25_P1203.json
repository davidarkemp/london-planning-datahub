    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front porch by reason of its combined design, siting, height, width and depth results in a visually intrusive, incongruous, prominent and dominant form of development that fails to harmonise with the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the terrace row that its forms a part of and the visual amenity of the locality. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of Merton Local Plan (2024)",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
