    "Reason : 1 - Prior approval is required and refused.  The proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (GPDO) 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would create a sense of enclosure and potential result in unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 32 Heath Drive. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies D12.3 & D12.4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024. "
