    "Reason : 1 - The proposals would result in the unacceptable loss of family sized accommodation through the provision of two small flats, neither of which would be considered family accommodation. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policy CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of design, size and layout would i) fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space and ii) fail to provide adequate outdoor amenity space for Flat B resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, DCLG Technical housing standards -nationally described space standard 2015 and the draft London Plan Housing Design Standards LPG 2021.\r\n.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing sufficient safe, secure and accessible cycle storage and refuse and recycling facilities and that these would not have a negative impact on the appearance and character of the existing building and its wider setting contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policies SI 8 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS17 and CS 18 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Polices Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
