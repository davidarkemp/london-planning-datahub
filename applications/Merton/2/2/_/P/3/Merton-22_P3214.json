    "Reason : 1 - The proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED. This is because: \r\n\r\nA.1(i) The enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would be within 2 meters of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse,and the height of the eaves of the enlarged part would exceed 3 meters\r\n\r\nA.1(j) The enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the scheme would fail to comply with Class A Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and consequently Prior Approval is Required and Refused.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
