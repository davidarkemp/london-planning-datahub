    "Reason : 1 - Under schedule 2, Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED as to the siting and appearance of the proposed development for the following reason:\r\n\r\nThe combined inappropriate siting,  design, excessive height, width and bulk would result in a visually prominent, dominant and incongruous form of development that would adversely affect the character, appearance and the visual amenity of Bushey Road streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policy CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
