    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the unacceptable layout the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in\r\nsub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme thereby fails to meet the requirements of, in particular, policies D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS14 of the Site's and Policies Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - The development would result in the loss of a family sized unit (3b 4p  minimum), thereby failing to comply with Core Strategy policy CS14 and Policy H2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - The provision of an external staircase by reason of design, materials, size and location would fail to respect and complement the design and detailing of the original building and character of the wider setting of the local area and would represent an unneighbourly form of development that would be lead to a loss of privacy to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at 18 Seely Road and would therefore be contrary to policies; CS14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, London Plan 2021 policies D3 and D4",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of unsatisfactory cycle parking facilities the scheme fails to promote sustianable mode of travels contrary to, in particular, policy T5 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 5 - By reaosn of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional dwellings over and above the number of units currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of travel.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Core Strategy Policy CS20 and Policy T6 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
