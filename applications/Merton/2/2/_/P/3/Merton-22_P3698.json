    "Reason : 1 - Owing to the excessive double large rear roof extension, the scale, very poor design, form and raising of the ridge height of the proposed roof extension would not enhance or preserve historic cottages, conservation area ,that will result in detrimental harmful material impact on the character and appearance of the  historic cottages Conservation Area and also harmful impact on the small Victorian semis which have their own historic value.  Therefore, the proposal is contrary to National Planning Policy Framework  2021, Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14, London Plan (2021) Policy D4, Merton SPP (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3 in respect of character and appearance and would not enhancement or the preservation of the Cottages Conservation Area. ",
    "Reason : 2 - Owing to its excessive doble large roof extension with the rear dormers raising of the ridge height would unbalance the symmetry of the two semis, the scale, design and form of the proposed roof extension is likely to result in an undue increased sense of visible impact, loss of privacy, overlooking in respect of the rear dormer on the rear roof slope  adjacent (no. 43  and 47 Gladstone Road). Therefore the proposed double large rear roof extension development is considered contrary to Merton SPP (2014) Policy DMD2 in respect of neighbour amenity. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF 2021 as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF2021, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
