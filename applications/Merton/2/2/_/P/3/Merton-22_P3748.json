    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer roof extension on the roof of the outrigger by reason of its combined siting, height and depth results in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would adversely impact on the outlook and potentially daylight and sunlight from the first floor habitable room window on the recessed rear elevation of the adjoining occupant and thus adversely impact on the residential amenity of the adjoining occupants, in particular no. 8 Richmond Avenue.  The scheme would fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan, LBM Core Strategy (2011) CS14.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
