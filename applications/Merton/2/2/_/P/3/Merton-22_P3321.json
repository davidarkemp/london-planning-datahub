    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor roof terrace by reason of its combined siting and design is considered to result in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to reflect the appearance of the host site and the terrace row that it forms a part of.  The scheme does not comply with Merton's Core Planning Strategy policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of satisfactory evidence to demonstrate the lack of demand for the continued use of the Class E use in existing or alternative employment generating and/or community uses, the loss of office floor space in a sustainable location is considered to adversely impact on the vitality and viability of the Morden District town centre and Core Shopping frontage.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM E3 and DM R4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS3 and CS12 of Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed first floor roof terrace, by reason of its siting is considered to create an opportunity for overlooking, loss of privacy and prolong stayed generating noise and disturbance to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, the residential occupants at no. 16 London Road.   The scheme fails to comply with Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DM D2.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of information on existing and proposed service/delivery/refuse arrangement for the commercial and proposed residential units, the proposal is considered to adversely impact on the viability of the ground floor commercial floor space to the detriment of the vitality and viability of the town centre and adversely impact on the free flow of traffic to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM E3 and DM R4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS3, CS12 and CS17 of Core Strategy (2011)."
