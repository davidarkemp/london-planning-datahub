    "Reason : 1 - The proposed erection of a single storey rear extension dwellinghouse, by reason of its combined siting and design would result in an unsatisfactory development with restricted light availability, outlook, and amenity space for future occupiers of the dwelling. The scheme would be contrary to the London Plan design policies D1, D4, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed demolition of storage unit and lobby, and erection of a single storey rear extension dwellinghouse, by reason of its combined siting, design, and loss of commercial space would result in a residential over intensification of land to the detriment of the commercial character of the Conservation Area. The scheme is contrary to the SPP 2014 policies DM D2, DM D3, and DM D4. \r\n ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
