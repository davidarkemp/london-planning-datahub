    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its combined design, siting and width would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive, unsympathetic and dominant form of development that fails to respect the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the Arundel Avenue street scene, contrary to policy CS14 (Design) of the Core Planning Strategy 2011, policies DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments) and DM D3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.\r\n\"               It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
