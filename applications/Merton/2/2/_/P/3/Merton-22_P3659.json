    "Reason : 1 - Prior approval is hereby REQUIRED and REFUSED.  This is because neighbour representations have been received and under paragraph AA.3(12) of Class A Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country (General PErmitted Development) Order 2105 (as amended) have to have regard to the National Planning Policy Framework issued by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in February 2019, so far as relevant to the subject matter of the prior approval, as if the application were a planning application.\r\n\r\nThe proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, height and depth would be an overbearing, unduly dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would increase sense of enclosure toward adjoining ocucpants, in particular, no. 41 Wandle Bank. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). "
