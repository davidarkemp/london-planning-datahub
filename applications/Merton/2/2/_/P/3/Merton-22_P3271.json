    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development could generate affordable housing provision, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing affordable housing provision, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM H3 (support for affordable housing) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), Policy CS8 (Housing Choice) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011), and Policies H4 (Delivering Affordable Housing) and H5 (Threshold approach to applications) of the London Plan (2021). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by virtue of its height, massing, bulk, siting and design would have a detrimental impact on the character and apearance of the existing building, and the Kingston Road/Brisbane Road street scene contrary to Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Adopted Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), and Policy CS 14 (Design) of the LBM Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in 1 additional residential unit, the site is located in a controlled parking zone, has very good access to public transport (PTAL 5) and there is no legal agreement in place for the unit to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS. 20 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
