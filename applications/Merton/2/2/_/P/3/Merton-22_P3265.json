    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its design, scale, form, massing and siting would result in an awkwardly bulky and dominant addition which would visually compete with the main building and harmfully unbalance the character and appearance of the host dwelling, semi and the Biggin Avenue streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its design, scale, form and proximity to no.3 Camomile Avenue  would be considered an unneighbourly form of development and would create an increased sense of enclose and harmful loss of light toward neighbouring occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).
