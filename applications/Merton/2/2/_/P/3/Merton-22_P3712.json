    "Reason : 1 - The general height, scale and form of the proposed roof additions would be inappropriate for the proposal's location, and the resulting bulk and mass would serve to erode the character and appearance of the host site and surrounding area. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The roof works including pitch roof and side dormers and windows, by reason of its design, scale, form and proximity to flats at 181 Worple Road and 183 Worple Road would be considered an unneighbourly form of development and would create an increased sense of enclose and harmful loss of light and overlooking toward neighbouring occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).
