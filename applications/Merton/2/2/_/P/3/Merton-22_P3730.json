    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its height, design and appearance would be considered an incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling, surrounding houses and the Wimbledon West Conservation Area. The proposal would be therefore contrary to Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton's Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
