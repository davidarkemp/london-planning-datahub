    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its siting, design, height, depth and width is considered to result in an incongruous, unsympathetic and visually intrusive form of the development that fails to relate to the form and proportion of the host property and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan policies D3 and D4, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its combined siting in close proximity to the common boundaries, height and depth results in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 25 and 29 Stanford Way.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
