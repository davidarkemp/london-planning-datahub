    "Reason : 1 - The general height, scale and form of the proposed dwelling would be inappropriate for the proposal's location, and the resulting bulk and mass would serve to erode the character and appearance of the host site and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of the provision of an undersized dwellinghouse, would result in an unsatisfactory and substandard offer of residential accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. This would be contrary to the London Plan (2021) Policy D6, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM D2 and the DCLG's\r\nTechnical Housing Standards (nationally described space standards) (2015). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to provide a soft-landscaping scheme, thereby failing to comply the objectives set out in G5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be air quality neutral, thereby failing to comply with policy S1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the schemee been considered acceptable, a corrected and accurate site locaiton plan would have been sought to reflect the submitted site address."
