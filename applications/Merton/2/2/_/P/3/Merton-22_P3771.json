    "Reason : 1 - The proposed amenity space by reason of its design, scale, form and siting, would be visually out of keeping with the character of the area. The proposed amenity space on top of the first-floor extension would appear bulky and unduly dominant, representing an incongruous form of development adversely impacting the character and appearance of the surrounding area and visual amenities of the surrounding neighbours. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D3, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed amenity space for the second-floor self-contained flat is considered to increase perceived overlooking opportunities and have a material impact to No. 74 Merton High Street. The proposal is also considered to have a negative impact due to the increased opportunities to stay for prolonged periods on the balcony therefore creating noise to the detriment of the adjoining dwellings. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D3, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
