    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its scale, design, form and depth, the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the adjacent Bertram Cottages Conservation Area, and also cause a harmful impact on the character of the host dwelling and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14, London Plan (2021) Policy D4 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2, DMD3 and DMD4. ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale, design, form and depth, the proposal would cause a harmful impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties 43 and 47 Gladstone Road in terms of loss of light and a harmful sense of enclosure. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14, London Plan (2021) Policy D4 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DMD2.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF 2021 as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF2021, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
