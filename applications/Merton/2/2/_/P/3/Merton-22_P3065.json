    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its design, scale, form and massing, would result in a visually intrusive and bulky form of development; appearing as a prominently incongruous addition, uncomfortably challenging streetviews to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of details of cycle storage provision the proposal fails to provide a sustainable form of development contrary to the London Plan (2021) Policy T5 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of an air quality statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be air quality neutral, thereby failing to comply with policy S1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of combined siting and height and absence of a daylight/sunlight assessment, the proposal results in a visually obtrusive, dominant and overbearing form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and result in overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular no. 9 Steers Mead and 1 Turner Avenue.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).    ",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the displaced off-street parking to no. 9 Steers Mead, the proposal will increase parking stress level and adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy DM T2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).    ",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of insufficient floor to ceiling height, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
