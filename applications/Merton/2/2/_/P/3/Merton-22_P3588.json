    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension and replacement window by reason of their siting, design, depth are considered to result in unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to respect the appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The single storey rear extension by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and potential impact on daylight/sunlight to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 4 Amber Court.  The scheme therefore fails to comply with the aims and objectives of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DMD2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n"
