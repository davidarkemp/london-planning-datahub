    "Reason : 1 - Prior approval is required and refused.  The proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (GPDO) 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, depth and height would result in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would increase sense of enclosure and potentially impact on daylight/sunlight and overshadowing toward the adjoining properties, in particular, no.19 Hawkes Road.  The proposal would be contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
