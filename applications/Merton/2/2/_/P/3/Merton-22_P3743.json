    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, depth and height is considered to represent an overbearing, visually intrusive and dominant form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and potentially cause unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular no. 6 Arthur Road.  Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, Policies DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, depth and height is considered to represent an unsympathetic and disproportionate form of development that fails to relate to the existing built form of the host dwelling and the terrace row that the site forms a part of and the locality.   Therefore, the scheme fails to complement the character of the original dwelling and their surroundings, and the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan.  \r\n\r\n"
