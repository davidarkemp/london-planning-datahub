    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, first floor rear extension and rear roof extension by reason of their combined siting, design, scale, bulk and massing results in a dominant, incongruous, unsympathetic and visually obtrusive form of development that destroys the uniform rear building line at first floor, the form, proportion and appearance of the host dwelling and the terrace row that the site forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of satisfactory tree protection plan and/or legal agreement to secure a financial contribution to secure the relocation of existing street tree or replacement tree planting, the proposal would adversely impact on the health and longevity of existing street tree to the detriment of the ecological and biodiversity of the borough and visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, policy CS13 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).
