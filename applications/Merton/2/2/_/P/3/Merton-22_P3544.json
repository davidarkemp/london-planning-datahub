    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension (including raised ridge and parapet walls), by reason of its design, height, siting, massing and form would result in an overly dominant, incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that fails to achieve a high standard of design that respects the character and appearance of the host dwelling, Clarendon Road street scene and general pattern of development in the area, contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its design, height, siting, massing and form would result in an unneighbourly form of development, resulting in loss of light, visual intrusion and sense of enclosure detrimental to the amenities of 20 and 20A Clarendon Road, contrary to Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed flats, by virtue of design and layout for the intended number of occupants would fail to achieve a high standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers, failing to meet minimum Gross Internal Areas and provide suitable outlook from the bedroom within the loft flat, contrary to Planning Policy DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Technical Housing Standards - nationally described space standard (2015)",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel) and DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), Policy CS20 (Parking, servicing and delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021)."
