    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwelling house and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. This would be contrary to the requirements set out in Class A, A.1 (j) of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension would extend 9.5m to the rear. This would be contrary to the requirements set out in Class A, A.1 (g) (i) of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey rear extension would have an eaves height of 4m as stated in the application form. This would be contrary to the requirements set out in Class A, A.1 (i) of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 4 - As a result of the lack of elevational drawings, it has been determined in line with A.4 (3) (b) of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) 2015 (as amended) that the developer has provided insufficient information to enable the authority to establish whether the proposed development complies with, the conditions, limitations or restrictions applicable to development permitted by Class A which exceeds the limits in paragraph A.1(f) but is allowed by paragraph A.1(g).",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the materials of the proposed extension would be similar in appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse. This would be contrary to the requirements set out in Class A, A.3 (a) of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) 2015 (as amended). Therefore, planning permission would be required."
