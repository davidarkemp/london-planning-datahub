    "Reason : 1 - Under Schedule 2, Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED as to the siting and appearance of the proposed development for the following reason: \r\n\r\nThe proposal, by reason of its prominent siting, design and height would result in an unduly dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that would adversely affect the character, appearance and the visual amenity of the streetscene and harm the character and openness and views into and from the adjacent Stanford Road Open Space. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D6 and DM O1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policies CS 13 and CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011; and Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Under Schedule 2, Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED as to the siting and appearance of the proposed development for the following reason:\r\n\t\r\nThe proposal, due to its siting, design and footprint, would create an obstruction on the footway disrupting the free flow of pedestrian traffic and add to street clutter in this location. As such, the equipment will impose risks to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, contrary to Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS18, CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM T2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Under Schedule 2, Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED as to failing to comply with A.3 (1)(a), (2)(a)(ii)(iii)(v)(vii)(ix) and (5)(a)(c) relating to serving notice, identifying the proposed site and informing the public of the consultation process.",
    "Reason : 4 - Under Schedule 2, Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended) and the National Planning Policy Framework paragraph 118, prior approval would be required and REFUSED as to failing to demonstrate that the ICNIRP safeguards would be complied with at the proposed location along Stanford Road."
