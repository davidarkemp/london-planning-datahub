The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The combined inappropriate siting, design, width and bulk of the proposal would result in a form of development that would disrupt pedestrian movement along this section of Church Road, and lead to pedestrian and highway safety implications.
