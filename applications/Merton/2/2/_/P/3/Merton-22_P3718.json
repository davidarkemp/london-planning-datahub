  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of satisfactory evidence to demonstrate the lack of demand for the continued use of the Class E use in existing or alternative employment generating and/or community uses, the loss of office floor space in a sustainable location is considered to adversely impact on the vitality and viability of the scattered employment sites in Kingston Road, Raynes Park. The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM E3 and DM R4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS3 and CS12 of Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed porch to the front elevation by reason of its combined siting and design is considered to result in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to reflect the appearance of the host site and the terrace row that it forms a part of.  The scheme does not comply with Merton's Core Planning Strategy policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of details of cycle storage, the scheme fails to provide a sustainable form of transport contrary to requirements of, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy T5 and Merton Sites and Polices Plan 2014 Policy DM T1.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the unacceptable design and layout and absence of private amenity space, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  As such, the proposal fails to meet the requirements of, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate the scheme would be air quality neutral and not result in a detrimental impact to air quality. The proposals are contrary to, in particular, policy S1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
