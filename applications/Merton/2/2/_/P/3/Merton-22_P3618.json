    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, contrived design and layout results in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to reflect the pattern of development in the Hammond Avenue locality to the detriment of visual amenity of the surroundings. The scheme fails to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan, Policy CS14 of the Sites and Policies Plan and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 in this regard.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would also fail to provide private external amenity space for occupiers of the first floor flat. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal fails to include information relating to the (1) siting or levels of provision of secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle and (2) the siting or levels of provision for a refuse store which would be convenient and would not adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality contrary to policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policy CS17 of Mertons Core Strategy 2011 and T5, SI7 & SI8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a satisfactory Transport Statement and adequate information including number of users, number and timetable of classes, number of employees, it has not been possible to determine the car and cycling parking requirements. It fails to demonstrate that the scheme will not impact on the freeflow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety contrary to policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policy CS17 of Mertons Core Strategy 2011 and T5, SI7 & SI8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the scheme would result in an air quality neutral development contrary to the requirements set out in policy SI 1 of the London Plan and Merton Council's Air Quality Statement SPD.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal fails to include any information relating to sustainable construction, biodiversity net gain and SUDS/flood measures and therefore the proposed development has failed to meet the objectives of policies G6, SI 2, SI 5, SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DMO2.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
