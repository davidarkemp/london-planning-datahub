    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of size, design and layout would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to provide a Flood Risk Assessment to demonstrate that the proposals would not increase the risk of flooding in the area and to mitigate the impact of future flooding for future occupiers of the development contrary to Policy DM F1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed ground floor 1 bedroom flat is located within  a PTAL score of 4 (good) and would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, the proposal would be contrary to policy CS20 of the Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is again advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
