    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extensions by reason of their design bulk, massing, height, length, siting and orientation, in relation to neighbouring dwellings, would i) be an inappropriate form of development that was not sympathetic to the design, scale, bulk and proportions of the original building nor complement the appearance of the wider setting resulting in the loss of the visual gap between properties, ii) would be an unneighbourly form of development that was visually intrusive and overly dominant resulting in an unacceptable effect on the living conditions of the occupiers of the properties to the rear of the site on Cranmer Farm Close and through overshadowing would be detrimental to the amenity of the occupiers of 11 Denham Crescent; and iii) would fail to provide a high standard of design that ensures good quality living conditions for future occupiers. Therefore the proposals would be contrary to policy D3 in the London Plan 2021, policies DM D1, DM D2 & DM D3 of the Council's adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and policy CS.14 of the Core Planning strategy (2011)."
