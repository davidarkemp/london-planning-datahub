    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of a combination of its excessive height, bulk, massing, and unsympathetic design would have an unacceptable impact on the character and apearance of the host dweling and terrace, contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (July 2011). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, massing and siting would be overbearing and result in an unacceptable level of visual intrusion, loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook, to the detriment of occupiers of No. 14 Ethelbert Road, contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014)   ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
