    "Condition : 20 - Designing Out Crime Informative-\r\n- The communal entrance doorset should be rated to a standard of PAS 23:2016,\r\nSTS201, LPS 2081 Security rating B+ or equivalent. They should also include audio /\r\nvideo access control by way of an encrypted fob.\r\n- Individual flat front door sets should meet the PAS 24:2016 or equivalent standards.\r\nThese must also meet the relevant fire ratings and a duel certificated door set is\r\npreferred.\r\n- All easily accessible windows and door sets (including patio doors) should be a\r\nminimum third party certified security standard of PAS 24:2016. I would include the\r\nwindows above the cycle stores as these may provide a climbing aid to the windows\r\nabove. \r\n- Cycle theft is a high crime driver not only in the London Borough of Merton but in\r\nLondon as a whole. External containers specifically designed for the secure storage\r\nof cycles would ideally be certified to a minimum of :-\r\n*LPS1175 Issue 7.2:2014 Security rating 1 (or above).\r\n*LPS1175 Issue 8:2018 Security rating 1/A1 9or above)\r\n*STS 202 Issue 7:2016 Burglary rating 1 (or above)\r\n*LPS 2081 Issue 1.1:2016 Security rating A\r\n*Sold Secure (Bronze, Silver or Gold).\r\nCycle stands should facilitate the locking of both wheels and the crossbar.\r\n- I would suggest if possible that a single leaf door is used for the refuse store as\r\ndouble leaf doors require double the security.\r\n- The footpath running from Eastfields Road along the property and existing homes is\r\nan area of concern. These areas attract Anti-Social behaviour plus this provides\r\ndiscreet access to the rear of the properties. Ideally we would suggest this be\r\nsecurely gated at the building line with access given to those who need it. I\r\nappreciate this may not be possible so to mitigate this Passive Infrared Lighting (PIR)\r\ncould be used along this passage way.\r\n- CCTV can help deter crime and criminal behaviour and provide reassurance for\r\nresidents. It can also provide key evidence of any criminal activity. We therefore\r\nre",
