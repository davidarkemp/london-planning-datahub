    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side extension and roof works, by reason of their design, position, bulk and massing, represent an incongruous form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive, detracting from the appearance, symmetry, spacing, scale and proportions of the host dwelling and pair of semis, failing to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale, proportions, height and massing of surrounding buildings, existing street patterns and the character and quality of the public realm and as such would be harmful to the visual amenities and character of the Hammond Avenue streetscene. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey side extension and roof works, by reason of their design, position, bulk and massing represent an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive and would result in a loss of light that would combine to be materially harmful to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at 25 Hammond Avenue. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3 and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
