    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its design, scale, form and siting would constitute an unduly dominant extension and would represent an incongruous and unneighbourly form of development resulting in harm to the character of the host building and existing terrace; and negative impact toward the amenity of neighbouring occupiers 9 & 13 Varley Way in terms of outlook and visual impact. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies D3 and D4, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
