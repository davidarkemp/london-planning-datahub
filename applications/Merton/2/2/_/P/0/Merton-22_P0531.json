    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension due to a combination of its height, depth and siting, would be visually intrusive, overbearing, and result in an unacceptable loss of outlook to the detriment of occupiers at Nos. 32 and 36 The Crescent. In addition, the propsal would result in an unaccepable level of daylight/sunlight loss to the detriment of occupiers of No.32 The Crescent. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
