    "Reason : 1 - The proposed reconfiguation of the roof space would result in the extension of the roof creating a crown roof which would detract from the host building, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and the visual amenity of the street scene. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Site and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.     \r\n   ii) The application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n   iii) It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n   iv) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
