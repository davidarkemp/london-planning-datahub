    "Reason : 1 - The proposed advertising panel, by reason of its size, scale, design, illumination and position would be considered a tall, dominating and overbearing form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the street scene and wider Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DM D2, DM D4 and DM D5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policies CS13 and CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.
