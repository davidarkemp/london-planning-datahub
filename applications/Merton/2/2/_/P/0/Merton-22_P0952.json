    "Reason : 1 - The proposed BT Street Hub by reason of its design and location is considered to lead to the introduction of unnecessary and excessive street advertisement furniture that fails to complement the use and function of the space and leads to visual clutter and excessive levels of street advertisement to the detriment of the visual amenity of the local area, contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D8 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D5.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate the proposed BT Street Hub would not have a detrimental impact to highways and pedestrian safety and vehicular movement along Lambton Road, Raynes Park. This would be contrary to London Plan 2021 Policy T6, Core Planning Strategy Policy CS18 and CS20, and Policies DMD2 and DMT2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
