    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of the issues of visual clutter at pre application stage and during consideration of the application but sought the determination of the application. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed BT Hub by reason of its design and location is considered to lead to the introduction of unnecessary and excessive street advertisement furniture that fails to complement the use and function of the space and leads to visual clutter and excessive levels of street advertisement to the detriment of the visual amenity of the local area, contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D8 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D5.
