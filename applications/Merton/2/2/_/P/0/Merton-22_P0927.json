At no time shall the approved loft level be occupied until the approved external works at no. 50 Wandle Road are complete.\r\n\r\nReason - To ensure that the development proposed results in a co-ordinated roof form, and therefore complies with policy CS14 of Merton's Core Palnning Strategy and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. The works would not be acceptable without this condition in place given that development to one property only would result in a discorent roof form.",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n"
