    "Reason : 1 - The application site is or forms part of land situated within a 3km radius of the perimeter of an aerodrome (St Georges Hospital, Blackshaw Road, London SW17 0QT) which is used by aircraft engaged in the public transport of passengers, and therefore fails to comply with AA.1 (o) (vii) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A AA- New dwellinghouses on detached buildings in commercial or mixed use of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - By virtue of its siting, design, materials and unsatisfactory layout,  the development would i) would fail to enhance, respect and complement the design and detailing of the original building and the character and appearance of the wider setting and ii) result in material harm to the amenity of future occupiers due to the failure to provide adequate natural light to the habitable rooms of all the proposed units contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Part 1 of Schedule 2, Class AA- New dwellinghouses on detached buildings in commercial or mixed use, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of the provision of required off-street parking and/or parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking demand arising from the proposed development and absence of satisfactory cycle parking provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and fails to provide a sustainable form of development.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 policies T5 and T6.1, Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 20 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM T2.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application . \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
