    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor element of the proposal by reason of its design, size, scale and mass would result in an overbearing, visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that would dominate the form of the host building, harm the visual amenities of the streetscene and result in material harm to neighbouring amenity by way of a materially harmful overbearing effect and sense of enclosure to occupiers at no. 4 Evesham Road. The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of LBM Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - *INFORMATIVE*\r\nDrawings indicate that the ground floor addition would have a fairly low eaves height of 2m. If the applicant decides to submit a new application they are encouraged to provide section drawings and consult Merton's Small Sites Toolkit SPG. Section 7.1.4 stipulates: Any area with a finished floor to ceiling height of less than 1.5m is not usable space. The section drawings should indicate the ceiling height and finished floor level in order to determine if the proposal is compliant with the above."
