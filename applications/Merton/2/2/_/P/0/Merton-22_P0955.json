    "Reason : 1 - The proposed internally illuminated LCD display screens by reason of its design and siting is considered to lead to the introduction of unnecessary and excessive street advertisement that fails to complement the use and function of the space and resulting in the inappropriate proliferation of advertisements which has a harmful impact on the character, appearance and visual amenity of the wider public realm, contrary to, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D5.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the pre and full application but the application was still submitted. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n"
