    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part two storey part single storey side and rear extensions by reason of their design, position, bulk, massing and the loss of trees, detracts from the appearance, scale and proportions of the host dwelling, fails to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale, proportions and massing of surrounding buildings, existing street patterns and the character and quality of the public realm and as such would be harmful to the visual amenities of the Aberconway Road streetscene and neighbouring occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan 2021 policies D3, D4 and G7, policies CS 13 & CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D3 & DM O2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed part two storey part single storey side and rear extensions by reason of their design, position, bulk and massing represent an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive and lead to overshadowing of the neighbouring garden to the material detriment of neighbour amenity. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
