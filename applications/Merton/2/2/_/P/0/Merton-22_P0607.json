    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof dormers, by virtue of their design, size and siting represent an incongruous, unduly dominant, visually intrusive and unneighbourly form of development that would i) fail to respect the character of the original building, surrounding context and prevailing positive characteristics of the immediate area and ii) fail to protect the amenity of neighbouring occupiers through visual intrusive and loss of privacy; contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM D2 & DM D3 and London Plan 2021 Policy D3  "
