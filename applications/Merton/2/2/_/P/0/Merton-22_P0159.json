    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front porch by reason of its design, size and siting would be visually incongruous and out of character with the host dwelling, detracting from the appearance of the host dwelling and the terrace of which it forms a part and the prevailing form and character of the immediate Close to the detriment of the visual amenities of the Octavia Close streetscene and Wandle Valley Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS14 of the\r\nMerton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
