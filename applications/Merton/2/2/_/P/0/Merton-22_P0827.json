    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, this would be contrary to the requirements set out in Class A, A.1(j)(ii) of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, form and massing, would be overbearing, unduly dominant and visually intrusive; resulting in an unacceptable loss of light, outlook and increased sense of enclosure toward adjoining property 82 Cavendish Road. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
