There would be inadequate standards of external amenity space and a harmful impact on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers by way of noise disturbance, overlooking and loss of outlook, contrary to Policies HC1, D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
