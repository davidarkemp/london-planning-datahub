    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in an overbearing increased sense of enclosure towards ground and first floor windows at no. 3 Gap Road. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to comply with Merton Sites and Policies Plan DMD2 in respect of neighbour amenity.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would provide unsatisfactory levels of daylight and outlook for occupants of the basement flat and would fail to provide adequate depth of balcony for units 3 and 5. Accordingly, the proposed development would fail to comply with Merton sites and policies plan policy DMD2 part v) and London Plan Policy D6 in respect of quality of accommodation. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a legal agreement restricting future occupants from obtaining parking permits in the nearby Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ), the proposal would cause undue pressure on parking in the local area thereby falling contrary to with Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS 20 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM T1 and DM T2.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n"
