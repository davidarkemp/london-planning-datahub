    "Reason : 1 - The scale, form, design, positioning and materials of the proposals are considered to have an undue detrimental impact on neighbouring amenity. Therefore, the proposals fail to comply with the principles of policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.  \r\n\r\nIt is therefore recommended to refuse permission. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed additional storey at Unit 10 is considered to result in overdevelopment of the site and surrounding area and is therefore considered harmful to the character of the site and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposals are considered to fail to comply with the principles of policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.   Therefore, the proposals are considered to fail to comply with the principles of policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - Bedroom 2 of Unit 10 at 1st floor level would have obscure glazed windows which would provide very poor levels of daylight/sunlight providing a poor level of accommodation. This element of the proposals is therefore considered to fail to comply with the principles of policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.   Therefore, the proposals are considered to fail to comply with the principles of policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D6 of the London Plan 2021.  ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\nThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n"
