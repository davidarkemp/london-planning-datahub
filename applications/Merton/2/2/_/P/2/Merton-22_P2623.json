  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed second floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive size, height, design and appearance would be considered an incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling, adjoining terraces and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Wimbledon West Conservation Area. The proposal would be therefore contrary to policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, DM D2, DM D3 and DMD4 of the Merton's Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed second floor rear extension, by reason of its excessive size, height, design and appearance would cause a harmful impact on the amenity of number 31 Denmark Road through loss of light, loss of outlook and overbearing presence. The proposal would be therefore contrary to policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton's Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.
