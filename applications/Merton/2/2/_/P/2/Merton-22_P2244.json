The development therefore fails to preserve or enhance the setting, character or appearance of the building, street and the Conservation Area the site forms part of, contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D2, DM D3, and DM D4, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan 2021 policy D3, D4 and HC1.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would by reason of its depth, height, siting and massing would result in material harm to the neighbouring occupier at No.5 Watery Lane by way of unreasonable sense of enclosure, loss of light, loss of outlook and oppressive appearance, contrary to Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011, Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and London Plan 2021 policy D3",
