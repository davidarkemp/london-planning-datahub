    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application . \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor and roof extensions by reason of their design, position, bulk and massing, represent an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive, detracting from the appearance, scale and proportions of the host dwelling, failing to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale, proportions and massing of surrounding buildings, existing street patterns and the existing suburban character and as such would be harmful to the visual amenities of the Streatham Road streetscene and neighbouring occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan policy D3, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
