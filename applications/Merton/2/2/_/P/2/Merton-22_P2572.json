    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its combined siting, design, width, scale, form and proportions results in an unsympathetic, visually intrusive, cramped, incongruous, dominant and prominent form of overdevelopment that fails to relate to the host property and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the streetschene.  The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of details of front boundary treatment and absence of details to confirm the provision of satisfactory visibility splays, the proposed alterations to the forecourt to facilitate the provision of an additional off-street parking space is considered to adversely impact on the visual amenity of the street scene and fails to safeguard highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, Policy CS 20 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and SPP DM T2 and T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
