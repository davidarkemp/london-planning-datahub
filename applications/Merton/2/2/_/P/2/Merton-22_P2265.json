    "Reason : 1 - The proposed combined hip to gable and rear roof extension, by reason of its design, siting, and massing, would appear out of character with and detract from the streetscene, the prevailing \"hipped roof\" character of the roofscape of Westcoombe Avenue,  and the character and appearance of the surrounding conservation area, in particular the roofscape as identified in the Westcoombe Avenue Design Guide. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies DM.D2 and DM.D3 and D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), and CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
