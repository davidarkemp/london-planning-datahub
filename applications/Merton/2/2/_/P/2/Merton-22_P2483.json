    "Reason : 1 - The proposed Part Single Storey Rear /Part Two Storey Rear Extensions by reason of their design, positioning, scale and form would not respect and complement the design and detailing of the original building and the adjoining 4 row of terraced dwellinghouses, which would be visually prominent from the surrounding rear gardens of the neighbouring properties, out of keeping with the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2021, Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed Part Single Storey Rear /Part Two Storey Rear Extensions by reason of their scale, form and position on the boundary, would cause an overbearing impact, increase sense of enclosure and loss of light to number 126 Somerset Road.

    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
