    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace and associated enclosure by reason of its combined siting and design would result in an prominent, visually intrusive, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would introduce an alien design feature at roof level to the detriment of the visual amenity of the host property, the terrace row it forms a part of and the surrounding area in general.  The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, the London Plan design policies D1, D4,  Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dormer roof extension and roof terrace with associate enclosure by reason of their combined siting, depth and height would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would result in unacceptable sense of enclosure to nearby occupants, in particular, the occupants of the first floor flat at no. 86 Boundary.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM D2, DM D3.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
