    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its combined unacceptable siting, depth, width, design, scale, form and massing together with the crown roof, would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that would destroy the appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling and the terrace row that its form a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of combined siting and height and absence of a daylight/sunlight assessment, the proposal results in a visually obtrusive, dominant and overbearing form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and potentially result in overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular no. 103 Stanford Road.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).    ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable layout the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme fails to meet the requirements of policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS14 of the Site's and Policies Plan.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed number of cycle parking spaces does not comply with Table 10.2 of T6 of the London Plan 2021 and therefore fails to fully promote the use of more sustainable modes of travel. This would be contrary to the London Plan (2021) Policy T5 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a parking survey the applicant has failed to demonstrate the scheme would not result in a detrimental impact on the highway and parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of proximity to the junction with Burley Close, unsatisfactory forecourt layout and absence of satisfactory information to demonstrate the provision of adequate visibility space, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme is contrary to Policy CS18, CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM T2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of satisfactory information to demonstrate the scheme will safeguard the health and longevity of existing street tree and any information of replacement tree planting, the proposal is considered to adversely impact on the appearance and visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme is contrary to policy D8 of the London Plan 2021, policy DM D2 and DM O2 of Merton's Sites and Polices Plan.",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of an air quality statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be air quality neutral, thereby failing to comply with policy S1 of the London Plan 2021."
