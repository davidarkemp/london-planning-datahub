    "Reason : 1 - The roof terrace, doors and screening, by reason of design, size, elevated position, height, scale and form fails to achieve a high standard of design, failing to respect the host property and general pattern of development in the area and is an unneighbourly form of development byway of being overly prominent, visually intrusive and cause of noise disturbance to the detriment of the amenities of 29 & 37 Stanford Way, contrary to planning policies DMD2 (Design considerations in all developments), DMD3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) & DM EP2 (Reducing and mitigating noise) of Merton's Sites Policies Plan (July 2014), policy CS14 (Design) of Merton's Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), D4 (Delivering good design) & D14 (Noise) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
