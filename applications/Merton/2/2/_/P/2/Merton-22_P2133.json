    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension by reason of the design, materials,\r\nposition, bulk and massing, represent an unduly prominent, visually dominant and \r\nintrusive form of development, detracting from the appearance, scale and proportions of \r\nthe host dwelling, failing to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale, \r\nproportions and massing of surrounding buildings, existing street patterns, the existing \r\nsuburban character, sense of openness and natural surveillance at the road junction and \r\nas such would be harmful to the visual amenities of the Southway/Woodlands \r\nstreet scene. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan policy D3, policy CS.14 of \r\nthe Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the \r\nMerton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
