Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with the Policies DMD2, DMD3, of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011, and Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of combined siting, height and lack of satisfactory visibility splays at the vehicular access, the scheme results in an unsafe form of development that fails to safeguard highway and pedestrian safety.  The proposal fails to comply with the Policies DM T5, of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and Policy CS20 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011.",
