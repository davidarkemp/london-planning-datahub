    "Condition : 19 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service.  \r\n\r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome. \r\n\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.  \r\n\r\nIn this instance: \r\n   ii) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   iii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n",
    "Condition : 20 - INFORMATIVE:\r\n\r\nDamage to the public highway: \r\n\r\nCare should be taken to ensure that no damage is caused to the public highway adjacent to the site during demolition and (or) construction. The Council will seek to recover any expenses incurred in repairing or making good such damage from the owner of the land in question or the person causing or responsible for the damage.  \r\n\r\nBEFORE ANY WORK COMMENCES you MUST contact the London Borough of Merton, Telephone 020 8274 4901 to arrange a pre-commencement photographic survey of the public highways adjacent to and within the vicinity of the site. The precondition survey will ensure you are not charged for any damage which existed prior to commencement of your works. \r\n\r\nIf you fail to contact us to arrange a pre commencement survey then it will be assumed that any damage to the highway was caused by your activities and you will be charged the full cost of repair. \r\n\r\nOnce the site works are completed you need to contact us again to arrange for a post construction inspection to be carried out. If there is no further damage then the case will be closed. If damage or further damage is found to have occurred then you will be asked to pay for repairs to be carried out. \r\n\r\n Noise control - Building sites: \r\n\r\nThe attention of the applicant is drawn to the requirements of section 60 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 in respect of the minimisation of noise and vibration on construction and demolition sites. Application, under section 61 of the Act for prior consent to the works, can be made to the Environmental Health Department. \r\n\r\nUnder the Act the Council has certain powers to control noise from construction sites. Typically the council will limit the times during which sites are permitted to make noise that their neighbours can hear.  \r\n\r\nFor general construction works the Council usually imposes (when necessary) the following limits on noisy works:- \r\n\r\nMonday to Friday 8am to 6pm \r\n\r\nSaturdays 8am to 1pm \r\n\r\nSundays",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers for both units. Flat 1 would fail to protect the amenity of future occupiers from noise, disturbance, privacy and outlook for the bedroom and passive ventilation for the bedroom. The family sized unit would have a poor layout thereby failing to meet the requirements of policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS14 of the Site's and Policies Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be air quality neutral, thereby failing to comply with policy S1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional dwellings over and above the number of units currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011. "
