    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its design, siting, appearance, height and scale would be visually intrusive and inappropriately conspicuous, harming views into and from the adjacent Open Space, Metropolitan Open Land and harming the character and appearance of the Mitcham Green streetscene, Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area and setting of adjacent listed buildings. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D4, DM D6 and DM O1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policies CS 13 and CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011; and Policies D4, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a heritage statement, the proposal does not accord with chapter 16 of the NPPF 2021 and policy DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n"
