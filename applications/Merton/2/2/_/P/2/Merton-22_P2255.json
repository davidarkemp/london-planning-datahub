    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to a combination of its height, bulk, massing and design would have a detrimental impact on the Haydons Road streetscene, as well as the character and appearance of the existing building; neighbouring buildings; and the immediate surrounding area contrary to Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014), Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy (2011) and Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its position, scale, height and bulk represents an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive resulting in a sense of enclosure, overlooking and obstruction of daylight and sunlight which would be materially harmful to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers in particular those at 2 Cardigan Road and units at 124-128 Haydons Road, whilst creating a materially harmful sense of enclosure at the front of the top floor of 130 Haydons Road. The development is therefore contrary to policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) which seeks to protect the amenity of adjacent occupiers.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel) and DM T3 (Car parking and\r\nservicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), Policy CS20 (Parking, servicing and delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policies T6 (Car Parking) and T6.1 (Residential Parking) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would fail to create an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupiers due to a lack of daylight and sunlight and sense of enclosure to the rear windows of proposed units above 124 and 126 Haydons Road. The development is therefore contrary to policies DM1 and DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) which seeks to protect the amenity of future occupiers.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
