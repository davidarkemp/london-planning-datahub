    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to a combination of its height, bulk, massing and design would have a detrimental impact on the streetscene; neighbouring buildings; and the immediate surrounding area contrary to Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014), Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy (2011) and Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of the position, scale, materiality and bulk of the lift shaft represents an unneighbourly form of development that would be visually  intrusive resulting in a sense of enclosure and obstruction of daylight and sunlight which would be materially harmful to the amenity of Flats 3, 5 and 7 of 89 Worple Road, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) which seeks to protect the amenity of adjacent occupiers.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel) and DM T3 (Car parking and\r\nservicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), Policy CS20 (Parking, servicing and delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policies T6 (Car Parking) and T6.1 (Residential Parking) of the London Plan (2021)."
