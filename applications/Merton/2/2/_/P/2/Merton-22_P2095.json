    "Condition : 1 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n   iv) It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n   v) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its design, scale, form, massing and siting would result in an awkwardly bulky and dominant addition which would visually compete with the main building and harmfully unbalance the character and appearance of the host dwelling, semi and the Biggin Avenue streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021."
