    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to provide clarity on the application site as required by Class A, A.4 (3) resulting in the inability to enable the authority to establish whether the proposed development complies with, the conditions, limitations or restrictions applicable to development permitted outlined in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to pay the required fee and therefore does not comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (2) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, form and massing, would be overbearing, unduly dominant and visually intrusive; resulting in an unacceptable loss of light and outlook toward the adjoining/adjacent property no. 120 Dudley Drive. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
