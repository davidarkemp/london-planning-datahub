    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be visually intrusive and inappropriately conspicuous, comprising views into and from the adjacent Open space and harmfully spoiling the setting of the Tudor Drive streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D6 and DM O1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policies CS 13 and CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011; and Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to its design and siting, would introduce unsuitable obstructions imposing a safety risk on the highway network for all road users, contrary to Policy DM T2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - Informative: The applicant should be aware that the ICNIRP certificate should include drawing numbers which match that submitted. "
