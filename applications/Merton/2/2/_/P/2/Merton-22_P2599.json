    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers for both units. Unit 2 would be undersized as would bedroom 4 and Unit 2 would not provide a double bedroom thereby failing to meet the requirements of policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS14 of the Site's and Policies Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed positioning of the cycle storage at the rear/side of the garden has not been demonstrated to be conveniently located, and fails to fully promote the use of more sustainable modes of travel. This would be contrary to the London Plan (2021) Policy T5 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed positioning of the waste storage at the rear/side of the garden has not been demonstrated to be conveniently located, with adequate access safe and convenient access for occupiers. This would be contrary to the London Plan (2021) Policy SI 8 and 9 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS17.",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be air quality neutral, thereby failing to comply with policy S1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumption reductions can be achieved so as to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2021) Policies SI 2 and SI 5, and Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) Policy CS 15.",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
