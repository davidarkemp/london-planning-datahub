    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side and rear extension, by reason of design, position, scale, bulk and massing would be an unneighbourly form of development being unduly prominent and visually dominant and intrusive to the site and surrounding area, and would result in an increase sense of enclosure, loss of light, and outlook and overshadowing as such would be harmful to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at 61 Mostyn Road. The proposals would be contrary London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Core Strategy Policy CS14 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe granting of planning permission for this development does not confer or imply to confer a right to build on land in shared or communal ownership. The applicant is advised to secure any necessary consents over and above planning permission and approval under the Building Regulations in order to build on the shared access way leading to the rear of the site.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
