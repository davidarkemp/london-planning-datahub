    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey side extension by reason of bulk, scale and design would constitute an obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would fail to reflect the design or complement the bulk and proportions of the original building to the detriment of the appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan policies D3 and D4, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the SPP 2014 and CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
