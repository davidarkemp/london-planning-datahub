    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its lack of set back from the front elevation of the building and lack of set down from the main roof of the host building would fail to respect the original proportions of the building and would unbalance the original symmetry of the pair of semi-detached houses. The proposed two storey rear and side extension would create a chamfered corner to the building and would result in an awkward and contrived roof form and overall form to the building. The two extensions would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host building and the appearance of the street scene. As such the proposal would fail to comply with the London Plan Policy D4, Merton Core Strategy 2011 Policy CS14 and Merton Site and Policies Plan 2014 Policies DM D2 and DM D3. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
