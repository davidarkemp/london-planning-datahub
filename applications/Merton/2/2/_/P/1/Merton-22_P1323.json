    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposals would not have a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of the on-site tree subject to the tree preservation order. This proposal would not ensure trees and landscape features are protected therefore undermining the London Borough of Merton's efforts to conserve and enhance the natural environment contrary to London Plan 2021 Policy G7, Core Planning Strategy policy CS13 and Policies DMD2 and DMO2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
