    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension pro posed would be visually harmful to the host site and surrounding area. It would also result in an unacceptable level of visual intrusion, loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook  to the detriment of occupiers of 52 Longthornton Road and therefore in conflict with Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of size would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers for future occupiers of Flat A and Flat C. The proposal would also fail to provide external amenity space for occupiers of Flat C. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would minimise water use and CO2 emissions as well as include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",

    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
