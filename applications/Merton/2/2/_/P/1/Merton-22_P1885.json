    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its siting and size, would create an obstruction on the footway and add to street clutter in this location. As such, the equipment will impose risks to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, contrary to Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS18, CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM T2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be visually intrusive and inappropriately conspicuous, comprising views into and from the adjacent Open space and harmfully spoiling the setting of the Malmesbury and surrounding streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D6 and DM O1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policies CS 13 and CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011; and Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
