    "Reason : 1 - The two storey outbuilding, by reason of its design and form fails to blend and integrate well with the its surroundings, is considered to be unduly dominant and visually intrusive, having a negative impact on the character and appearance of Dahlia Gardens and Hadley Road. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The two storey outbuilding by reason of its scale, bulk, form and massing, is considered to be an unneighbourly form of development creating unacceptable loss of light, privacy and outlook toward the adjoining properties along Dahlia Gardens and Hadley Road. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - Informative:\r\nINFORMATIVE:\r\nYou are made aware that; Following the refusal of this permission, the owner shall be required to remove the first-floor element of the outbuilding in pursuant to the existing open enforcement case ref no: 21/E0327. The applicant is given 14 days of the date of this decision notice to complete this, otherwise the Council will consider formal enforcement action. Please contact planningenf@merton.gov.uk for further details or assistance.\r\n"
