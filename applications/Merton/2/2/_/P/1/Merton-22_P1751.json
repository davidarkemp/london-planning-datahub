    "Reason : 1 - The application does not include a formal undertaking to ensure the existing Traffic Management Order is modified to secure the necessary highway markings to remove the bays and provide yellow lines on the highway between the proposed vehicle crossovers, where there is not sufficient space to reincorporate a parking bay or that the future occupiers of the development are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone and in the absence of the necessary highway markings and in the absence of a restriction on the issuing of parking permits, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking which would lead to increased kerbside parking and an unduly harmful impact on pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and required the submission of a s.106 agreement to address these issues. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n"
