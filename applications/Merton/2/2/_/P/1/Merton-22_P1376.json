    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of size and layout would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal would also fail to provide external amenity space for occupiers of Flat B. The substandard three bedroom flat proposed would not mitigate for the loss of the existing\r\nfamily sized dwelling. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to provide refuse provision, therefore the proposal fails to comply with policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021, CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that the additional unit created is prohibited from obtaining parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in an undue impact on highway safety and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to Policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
