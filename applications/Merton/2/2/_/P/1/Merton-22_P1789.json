    "Condition : 3 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The materials and design of the proposed rear roof dormer extension would appear visually intrusive, unduly dominant and fail to respect the appearance or character of the original building and its wider setting and would be contrary to policies D3 and D4 in the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policy DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
