    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: KDA/22/10MARL/P/02G.",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied, the proposed window in the northwest (side) facing elevation shall be glazed with obscure glass and fixed shut up to a height of at least 1.7m above the finished floor level and shall permanently maintained as such thereafter.",
    "Condition : 5 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The applicant was offered the opportunity to submit amended plans in order to make the proposal acceptable in planning terms.\r\n   ii) The application was approved subject to an agreed extension of time.\r\n ",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension would, by reason of its scale, form, depth and fenestration, result in material harm to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and that of the wider area and would result in material harm to the residential amenity of the occupiers of No.8 Marlborough Road by way of overlooking and loss of privacy, contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Startegy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
