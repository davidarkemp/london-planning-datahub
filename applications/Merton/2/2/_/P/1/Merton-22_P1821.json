    "Reason : 1 - The proposed additional storey, by reason of its height, form and backland siting, would result in an unsympathetic, intrusive and dominant form of development that would appear out of keeping with the scale and proportions of the original building and neighbouring buildings. The proposal would also result in sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers at 18-24 Laings Avenue and 17-25 Mortimer Road and result in a material loss of outlook and potential daylight/sunlight. The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
