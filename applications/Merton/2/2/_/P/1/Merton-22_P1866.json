    "Reason : 1 - The application site is or forms part of land situated within a 3km radius of the perimeter of an aerodrome (St Georges Hospital, Blackshaw Road, London SW17 0QT) which is used by aircraft engaged in the public transport of passengers, and therefore fails to comply with A.1 (o) (vii) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel) and DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), Policy CS20 (Parking, servicing and delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policies T6 (Car Parking) and T6.1\r\n(Residential Parking) of the London Plan (2021)."
