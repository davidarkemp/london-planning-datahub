    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building. Further information is available at the following link: \r\nhttp://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/buildingpolicyandlegislation/current legislation/partywallact\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIt is the responsibility of the developer to make proper provision for drainage to ground, watercourses or a suitable sewer.  In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off-site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of ground water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
