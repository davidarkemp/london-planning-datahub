    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be visually intrusive and inappropriately conspicuous, comprising views into and from the adjacent Open space and harmfully spoiling the setting of the Morden Road streetscene. It would also negatively impact the adjacent Wandley Valley Conservation Area and the adjacent Grade II Listed Morden Hall Park. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021; Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D4, DM D6 and DM O1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policies CS 13 and CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011; and Policy D8 of the London Plan 2021.
