    "Reason : 1 - Under Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval is REFUSED. \r\n\r\nThe additional storeys would be constructed on the principal part of the building and also on a lower part of the building, which would not be considered the principal part and therefore fails to comply with criterion A.1(d) of Class A Part 20 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Under Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval is REFUSED. \r\n\r\nThe site falls within 3km of an aerodrome and therefore fails to comply with criterion A.1(o)(vii) of Class A, Part 20, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Under Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval is REFUSED. \r\n\r\nIn the absence of sufficient on-site parking to serve the residential units and the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that additional units are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on-street parking to the detriment of the free flow of traffic in the locality and highway and pedestrian safety and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Under Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval is REFUSED. \r\n\r\nIn the absence of a Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality. The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - Under Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval is REFUSED. \r\n\r\nThe proposed development by reason of its combined siting, design, form and appearance would results in an incongruous, dominant and unsympathetic form of development that would adversely impact on the appearance and form of the host property to the detriment of the visual amenities of the street scene.  The proposal is in conflict with, in particular, Policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021, CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - Under Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval is REFUSED. \r\n\r\nThe proposed development, by reason of its combined height, proximity to the boundary and juxtaposition with the neighbouring property, would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would cause potential loss of light and create unreasonable sense of enclosure and overbearing form to the rear facing windows at Falcon House and an unreasonable sense of enclosure, overbearing form and loss of outlook to the rear windows and garden areas of nos.32-34 Morden Road, resulting in material harm to neighbouring amenity, in conflict with, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n\r\n"
