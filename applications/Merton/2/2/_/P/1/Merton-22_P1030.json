    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has provided conflicting drawings which fail to accurately show the proposed development, the site and the existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse, thereby failing to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.4(2)(b) of the GPDO (2015) (as amended). Furthermore, the proposed development would project a total depth exceeding 6m, thereby also failing to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1(g)(i) of the GPDO (2015) (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and offered the opportunity to withdraw the application. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the GPDO and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
