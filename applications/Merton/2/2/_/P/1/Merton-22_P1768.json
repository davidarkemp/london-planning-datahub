    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey side/rear infill extension side extension by reason of the design, materials, position, bulk and massing, represent an unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive form of development, detracting from the appearance, scale and proportions of the original dwelling, failing to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, rhythm, scale, proportions and massing of surrounding buildings, existing street patterns, the existing suburban character, sense of openness and natural environment at the road junction and as such would be harmful to the visual amenities of the Southway/Woodlands streetscene. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan policy D3 and G7, policy CS.14 and CS.13 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
