    "Condition : 57 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNo surface water runoff should discharge onto the public highway including the public footway or highway. When it is proposed to connect to a public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary. Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777). \r\n\r\nNo waste material, including concrete, mortar, grout, plaster, fats, oils and chemicals shall be washed down on the highway or disposed of into the highway drainage system.",
    "Condition : 58 - INFORMATIVE\r\nAny works/events carried out either by, or at the behest of, the developer, whether they are located on, or affecting a prospectively maintainable highway, as defined under Section 87 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, or on or affecting the public highway, shall be co-ordinated under the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic management Act 2004 and licensed accordingly in order to secure the expeditious movement of traffic by minimising disruption to users of the highway network in Merton. Any such works or events commissioned by the developer and particularly those involving the connection of any utility to the site, shall be co-ordinated by them in liaison with the London Borough of Merton, Network Coordinator, (telephone 020 8545 3976). This must take place at least one month in advance of the works and particularly to ensure that statutory undertaker connections/supplies to the site are co-ordinated to take place wherever possible at the same time.\r\n",
    "Condition : 59 - INFORMATIVE\r\nDemolition of buildings should avoid the bird nesting and bat roosting season. This avoids disturbing birds and bats during a critical period and will assist in preventing possible contravention of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which seeks to protect nesting birds/bats and their nests/roosts. Buildings should also be inspected for bird nests and bat roosts prior to demolition. All species of bat in Britain and their roosts are afforded special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside act 1981.  If bats are found, Natural England should be contacted for advice (tel: 020 7831 6922).\r\n",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The applicant/agent was provided with pre-application advice.\r\n   ii) The applicant was offered the opportunity to submit amended plans in order to make the proposal acceptable in planning terms.\r\n    iii) The application was considered by the Planning Committee where the applicant/agent had the opportunity to speak to the committee and promote the application.\r\n",
