    "Reason : 1 - The existing building is considered to make a positive contribution to the character of the site, the streetscene and the wider conservation area. The height and massing of the proposed new dwelling is considered to result in overdevelopment which would be incongruous and harmful to the character of the site, the wider streetscene and the character of the conservation area. As such the proposal is considered to fail to comply with DM D1, DM D2, DM D3, DM D4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan, DM D4, DM D8 and HC1 of the London Plan and Section 16 of the NPPF."
