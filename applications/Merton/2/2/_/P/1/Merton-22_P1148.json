    "Reason : 1 - The proposed new dwelling, by reason of its height, bulk, massing, proximity to the site boundaries and fenestration, would result in material harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers as follows:\r\n\r\nNo 1 and 2 Meadway: Loss of outlook, Overbearing form and loss of sunlight to rear facing windows and gardens.\r\n\r\nNo.3 Meadow Close: Loss of outlook and overbearing form when viewed from the garden. Overlooking and loss of privacy to the rear garden.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 Meadow Close: Overlooking and loss of privacy to the rear garden.\r\n\r\nContrary to, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its combined backgarden siting, contrived design and layout results in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to reflect the pattern of development in the locality to the detriment of visual amenity of the surrounding.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan, Policy CS14 of the Sites and Policies Plan and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 3 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would be air quality neutral, contrary to, in particular, Policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
