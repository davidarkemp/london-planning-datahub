As such the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Site and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
