    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part three part two storey rear extension by reason of its combined siting, height, depth, width and unsympathetic design results in a prominent, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of gross overdevelopment that destroys the form and proportion of the host property and fails to demonstrate an understanding of the character of the terrace row that the site forms a part of to the detriment of the appearance and character of the terrace row that the site forms a part of and the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal thus fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM D1 and DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and London Plan policy D3.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed part three and part two storey rear extension by reason of its combined siting, height, width and depth would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would adversely impact on outlook and potential daylight and sunlight to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, the upper floor flat at no. 189 Merton Road.  The proposal is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, Policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that the additional dwelling over and above the number of unit currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not be satisfactorily demonstrated that the development would be air quality neutral, thereby failing to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, policy S1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
