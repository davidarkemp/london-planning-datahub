    "Condition : 29 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThere may be public sewers crossing or close to your development. If you discover a sewer, it's important that you minimize the risk of damage. Thames Water will need to check that your development doesn't limit repair or maintenance activities, or inhibit the services Thames Water provides in any other way. The applicant is advised to read the Thames Water guide working near or diverting our pipes.\r\n\r\nA Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water will be required for discharging groundwater into a public sewer. Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. Thames Water would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures he will undertake to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 020 3577 9483 or by emailing trade.effluent@thameswater.co.uk\r\n\r\nThames Water will aim to provide customers with a minimum pressure of 10m head (approx 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where it leaves Thames Waters pipes.

    "Condition : 32 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIt is the responsibility of the developer to make proper provision for drainage to ground, watercourses or a suitable sewer.  In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off-site storage.
