    "Reason : 1 - The existing first floor rear extension, by reason of their scale, form, bulk, massing, design and positioning is considered to be unduly prominent resulting in an incongruous addition to the host dwelling and have an undue detrimental effect on the to the amenity of neighbouring properties and character and appearance of the host dwelling. Therefore, the proposal does not comply with the principle policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a completed S106 unilateral undertaking to restrict the future occupiers of the proposed HMO (Sui Generis) 10 units from obtaining on-street residential parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - Informative 1 \r\nThe existing first floor rear extension to the dwellinghouse has not been built according to LBM Planning Permission: 22/P0823, as such it is in breach of planning control.",
    "Reason : 4 - Informative 2\r\nThe applicant must make contact with the LBM Highways Team (Contact Telephone Number: 02085453133), regarding the public highway licence. ",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
