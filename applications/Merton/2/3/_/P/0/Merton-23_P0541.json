    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of satisfactory evidence to demonstrate the lack of demand for the continued use of the Class E use in existing or alternative employment generating and/or community uses, the loss of office floor space in a sustainable location is considered to adversely impact on the vitality and viability of the Morden District town centre and Core Shopping frontage.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM E3 and DM R4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS3 and CS12 of Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not be satisfactorily demonstrated that the development would be air quality neutral, thereby failing to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, policy S1 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed walkway at roof level and associated railings by reason of its combined siting, design and length results in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to relate to the appearance of the site and the terrace row that the site forms a part of and the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal thus fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM D1 and DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and London Plan policy D3.
