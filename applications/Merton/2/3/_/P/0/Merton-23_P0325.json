    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its inappropriate siting, design and height would result in a visually intrusive form of development that would adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS 14 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014)",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its inappropriate siting, design, scale, height, bulk and mass, would result in an incongruous, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that fails to respect the character and pattern of development of outbuildings in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding area.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS 14 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014)",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n"
