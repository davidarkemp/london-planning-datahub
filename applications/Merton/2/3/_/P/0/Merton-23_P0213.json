    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, depth and height would result in an overbearing, visually intrusive and dominant form of development that would unacceptably result in an increase in sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 87 Fortescue Road. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nThe applicant is informed of inaccuracies on the submitted drawing as the depth of the neighbour's outrigger is not accurately shown.  In addition, the overall height of the proposed extension has not been stated correctly on the applicaiton form.  "
