    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reasons of its scale, height, design and form, is considered to detract from the character of the existing dwelling, street scene and wider character of the area. It would therefore be contrary to Policy CS 14 of the Council's adopted Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Council's adopted Site and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, due to its height and rear projection, would result in a loss of light, loss of outlook, be overbearing and cause overlooking to the amenity of neighbouring properties; notably No. 7 Bridges Road Mews and the Flats at 264a the Broadway. It would therefore be contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel) and DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), Policy CS20 (Parking, servicing and delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policies T6 (Car Parking) and T6.1 (Residential Parking) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
