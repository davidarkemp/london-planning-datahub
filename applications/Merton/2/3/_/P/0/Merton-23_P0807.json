    "Reason : 1 - By reason of loss of front boundary and unsatisfactory forecourt layout the scheme will impact on free flow of traffic to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal would not comply with policy CS14 and CS20 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DMT2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of site prominence and unsatisfactory roof design, the combined two dormer windows and two storey side extension results in a fussy and cluttered roof form that fails to contribute positively to the visual amenity and appearance of the Durham Road and Richmond Streetscene. The proposal would not comply with policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of loss of front garden vegetation and absence of satisfactory replacement planting. The proposal would not comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS13 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014).
