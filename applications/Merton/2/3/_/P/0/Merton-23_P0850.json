  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Prior approval is REQUIRED and REFUSED.  The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of the adjoining occupants, in particular, no. 90 Rutland Avenue. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  The proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Prior approval is REQUIRED and REFUSED.  The proposed single storey rear extension of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The proposal has not submitted evidence the single storey rear extension would be finished in materials of similar appearance to the existing building. As a result, the scheme would fail to comply with criteria A.1 (j) (iii) and condition A.3 (a) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and consequently Prior Approval is Required and Refused.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
