    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, terminating in a wall at a height of 3.625m, projecting beyond the side elevation of the existing dwelling, would be visible from the street and would appear overly bulky and out of keeping with the existing dwelling, resulting in material harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene. In addition, the proposal would be visually intrusive, overbearing and visually oppressive, leading to a loss of ambient light for occupiers at 37 Maycross Avenue. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the host site and Maycross Avenue as well as neighbouring amenity, contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Core Strategy Policy CS14 and SPP Policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
