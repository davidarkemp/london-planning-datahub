  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its siting, width, design, size, scale and mass would result in an unreasonably overbearing, visually intrusive and incongruous form of overdevelopment that would dominate the form of the host building and harm the visual amenities of the streetscene. The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its combined siting in close proximity to the common boundaries, height and depth, results in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and potentially impact on daylight/sunlight and cause overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, properties at no. 75/75a and 79-83 Love Lane. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposals by reason of substandard room size, layout and lack of communal spaces would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers for the large HMO. The proposal would also fail to provide external amenity space for occupiers of Flat C. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a water usage statement and an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use as well as include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal, by reason of the number of bedrooms and associated occupancy and management strategy, would give rise to an intensification of the use of the site, safety and security measures for future residents and thus would have the potential to be harmful to the residential character and amenities of neighbouring occupiers and by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policy H16 of the London Plan 2021; Policies DM D2 and DM H5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of an arboricultural survey, arboricultural impact assessment and arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the proposal is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing off-site tree to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
