    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, depth and height would result in an overbearing, visually intrusive and dominant form of development that would unacceptably result in an increase in sense of enclosure and potential loss of daylight/sunlight and overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no.202 and 198 Manor Road. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - As a result of the works, the total area of ground covered by buildings including the proposed extension and existing outbuilding within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse (other than the original dwellinghouse) would exceed 50% of the total area of the curtilage (excluding the ground area of the original dwellinghouse), thereby failing to comply with criteria A.1 (b) of Class A Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order (GPDO) 2015 (as amended)."
