    "Reason : 1 - The scale, form, design and positioning of the first-floor element of the two storey rear extension is considered to lead to a bulky and incongruous form of development which would alter the stepped profile of the rear of dwellinghouses along this part of Coombe Gardens, consequently leading to a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the immediate area. The first floor element would also lead to a visually oppressive form of development for occupiers at 9 Coombe Garden, leading to an unreasonable sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. As such, the proposal would not comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of The Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
