    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its position, scale, bulk and depth represents an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive resulting in a sense of enclosure which would be materially harmful to the amenity of both of the adjoining neighbouring occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) which seeks to protect the amenity of adjacent occupiers. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its scale, depth height and overall massing would be unsympathetic with the host dwelling and surrounding area contrary to London Plan (2021) D4 Delivering Good Design; Merton Core Strategy D2 Design; and Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Map (July 2014) DM D2 Design Considerations for all Developments",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
