    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, depth and height would result in a visually intrusive, overbearing and unduly dominant form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and potential overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 122 and 126 St Helier Avenue. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
