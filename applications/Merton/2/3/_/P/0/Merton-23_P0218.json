    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension, by reason of its siting, design, height, scale, bulk and form, would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would appear awkward and jarring, failing to blend and integrate well with the main building and its roofscape and would have a negative impact toward the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the surrounding area. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extensions, by reason of their combined siting, height, depth, scale, form and bulk would result in a visually intrusive and unneighbourly form of development and would create an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants in particular, no. 39 Camberley Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
