    "Reason : 1 - Under schedule 2, Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED as to the siting and appearance of the proposed development for the following reason:\r\n\r\nThe proposed mast and associated equipment, due to its siting, scale and appearance would represent a visually prominent feature in views along Cambridge Road and Coombe Lane and would be visually intrusive and add to visual clutter to the detriment of the character of the site, the local area and the setting of the adjacent conservation area and MOL land.\r\n\r\n The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy D8 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policy CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\t\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
