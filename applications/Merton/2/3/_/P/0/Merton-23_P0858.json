    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, design, depth and height would result in a visually intrusive, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would destroy the uniformity, appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling and its attached pair to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme would be contrary to the London Plan design policies D1, D4, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
