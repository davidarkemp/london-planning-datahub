    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by virtue of its bulk, massing, design and siting would appear discordant with the street-scene and unsympathetic to the appearance, scale, form, proportions and character of the original building and would be harmful to the visual amenities of the locality, contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) policy CS 14 of the London Borough of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n"
