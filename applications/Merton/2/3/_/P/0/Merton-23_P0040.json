    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its combined siting, design, height, width and depth would appear as an incongruous, cramped, visually obtrusive and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to relate to the pattern of development in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D1 and DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, height, depth and width will result in a visually intrusive and dominant form of overdevelopment that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure, potentially adversely impact on daylight/sunlight, create overshadowing and impact on outlook to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, the flats at 253 Streatham Road and 1 Rustic Avenue.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies plan (2014).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal by reason of its unacceptable layout and design represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of the future occupiers.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the scheme would result in an air quality netural development contrary to the requirements set out in  policy SI 1 of the London Plan and Merton Council's Air Quality Statement SPD.\r\n\r\n",

    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. \r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
