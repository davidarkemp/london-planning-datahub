    "Reason : 1 - The proposed raising of the ridge height, by reason of its siting, height, design and appearance, result in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would destroy the uniform ridge line of the terrace row to the detriment of the appearance of the host dwelling and the terrace tow that it forms a part of and the appearance of the streetscene and surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
