    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear enlargement is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (GPDO) 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 64 Templecombe Way. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear enlargement of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. As a result, the scheme would fail to comply with para A.1, (j) (iii) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and consequently Prior Approval is Required and Refused."
