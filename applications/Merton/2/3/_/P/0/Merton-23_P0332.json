    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part single, part two storey side and front extension, by reason of its design, scale, form, massing and siting would result in an awkwardly bulky and dominant addition which would visually compete with the main building and harmfully unbalance the character and appearance of the host dwelling, semi and the Biggin Avenue streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear roof extension and associated increased ridge, by reason of its design, scale, form, massing and siting would result in a contrived and unresolved roof addition which would harmfully unbalance the character and appearance of the host dwelling, semi and the Biggin Avenue streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed part single, part two storey side and front extension, by reason of its siting, height, width, scale, form and proximity to 3 Camomile Avenue would result in a visually intrusive, overbearing and dominant form of development that would create an increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 3 Camomile Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nInformative: The drawings still appear to be flawed/inconsistent. The applicant is encouraged to provide consistent drawings clearly illustrating all proposed changes. "
