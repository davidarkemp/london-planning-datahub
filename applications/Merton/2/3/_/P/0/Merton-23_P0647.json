    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of marketing evidence to demonstrate there is lack of demand for the continued use of the light industrial unit in existing use or other employment generating uses and/or community uses for a period of 30 months, the loss of existing commercial premises to residential (C3) use is considered to be contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM E3 and DM R4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS3 and CS12 of Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor extensions and roof terrace by reason of their combined siting, design, height, width, depth, bulk and mass are considered to result in an incongruous, prominent and dominant form of overdevelopment of the site that destroys the form and proportion of the host property and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme does not comply with, in particular, Merton's Core Planning Strategy (2011) policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2011) policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed first floor extensions, by reason of their siting, height and depth are considered to result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that will create a sense of enclosure and adversely impact on outlook from nearest habitable room windows to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, the residential occupants at no. 52 Central Road and 2 Hazelwood.   The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DM D2.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a completed legal agreement to restrict access of the additional residential units from gaining access to residents parking permits and unsatisfactory refuse arrangement, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on parking pressure and the free flow of traffic to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety in the locality.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM T2 and DM T3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS20 of Merton Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
