    "Reason : 1 - The scheme by reason of its combined siting, design, height, bulk and massing results in a visually obtrusive, unsympathetic, dominant and prominent form of overdevelopment that would adversely impact on the character and appearance of the area.  The scheme is therefore in conflict with, in particular, Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DMO1 and DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The scheme by reason of its combined siting, design, height, bulk and massing results in a visually obtrusive, overbearing and dominant form of overdevelopment that would adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 9 Dore Gardens, in terms of create an sense of enclosure.  The scheme is therefore in conflict with, in particular, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and design, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in substandard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS14, policy D5, D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development by reason of design and layout would fail to provide suitable and accessible garden areas for the two dwellings with the proposed garden arrangements failing to appear compatible with the character of surrounding areas contrary to, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of adequate secure and accessible cycle storage facilities for the development, the scheme fails to promote a sustainable form of development contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS18.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design and a Basement Impact Assessment, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding and land stability in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of adequate refuse and recycling storage facilities for the development, the scheme would adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021 and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS17.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\n In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application but requested the application be determined. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
