    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two-storey extension by reason of its height, massing, form and design, would result in a visually unbalancing effect to the pair of semi-detached dwellings and would appear dominant and intrusive, which would detract from the appearance, scale and proportions of the host dwelling, fail to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale, proportions and massing of surrounding buildings, and the existing suburban character and would be harmful to the visual amenities of the Lower Morden Lane streetscene. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan policy D3, Policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n"
