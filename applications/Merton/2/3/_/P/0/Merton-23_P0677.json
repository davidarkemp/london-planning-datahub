    "Reason : 1 - The combined inappropriate siting, design, excessive height, width and bulk of the proposal would result in a visually prominent, dominant and incongruous form of development that would adversely affect the character, appearance and the visual amenity of the Church Road streetscene, adjoining Conservation Area and Grade II* Listed Park. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policies D8 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The combined inappropriate siting, design, excessive height, width and bulk of the proposal would result in a form of development that would negatively impact the Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) and is considered to be a form of inappropriate development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy CS 13 of the Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM O1 and DM O2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.\r\n"
