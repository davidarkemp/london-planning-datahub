    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its design, scale, height, siting and form would fail to achieve a high standard of design, being an incongruous, unsympathetic and visually dominant form of development that fails to respect the character and appearance of the host dwelling, adjoining dwellings and the local character, contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, Chapters 4, 12 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 (Design) of Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments) and DM D3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its combined height, siting and depth results in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would adversely impact on the outlook and potentially daylight and sunlight of the rear elevation ground floor habitable room windows of the adjoining occupants and thus adversely impact on the residential amenity of the adjoining occupants, in particular no. 178 and 182 Aragon Road. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, the aims and objectives of, in particular, Chapters 4, 12 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 (Design) of Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments) and DM D3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
