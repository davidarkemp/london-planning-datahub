    "Reason : 1 - This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED. \r\n\r\nThe proposed hip to gable works and rear dormer, by reasons of a total volume greater than 50m3 and failing to demonstrate use of material visually similar to the existing house, would exceed the permitted development tolerances set out in criteria B1(d) and condition B.2(a) set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED. \r\n\r\nThe proposed front slope roof lights, by reason of absence of details confirming they would not protrude than 15cm from the roof slope, fail to demonstrate they would meet the permitted development tolerances set out in criteria C.1(b) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class C of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n",
