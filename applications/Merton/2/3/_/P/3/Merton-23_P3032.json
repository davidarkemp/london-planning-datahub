    "Reason : 1 - Due to inaccurate drawings and the absence of details of proposed material, Merton Council is unable to ascertain the impact on the character and appearance of the host site or the surrounding area nor are they able to assess the impact on neighbour amenity. It is therefore concluded that the proposal would be contrary to, in particular,  National Policy Planning Framework (2023) Chapters 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) Policy CS 14, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3, Merton's Design Supplementary Planning Document - Shop Front Guidance (2017). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, National Policy Planning Framework (2023) Chapters 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, London Plan (2021) policies SI7 and SI8, Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) CS17, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM R5 and Waste and Recycling Storage Requirements - Merton Council.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, National Policy Planning Framework (2023) Chapters 4, the London Plan (2021) Policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13, and Merton's Core Planning Strategy (2011) policy CS15.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed first floor rear fire escape by reason of its siting and length is considered to increase perceived overlooking opportunities and have a material impact to first floor flat at No. 8 Crown Lane. The proposal is also considered to have a negative impact due to the increased opportunities for creating noise associated with access to the detriment of the adjoining dwellings. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, National Planning Policy Framework (2023) Chapters 4 and12, London Plan (2021) Policies D3, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3. ",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
