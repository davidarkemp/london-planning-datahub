    "Condition : 1 - Commencement of development (Full Permission) - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - Approved Plans - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Location Plan; 01 amendment 20052024; 02; Permeable Paving; Footway Crossing Application",
    "Condition : 3 - Materials as Specified - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - Hardstanding (Flooding) - The hardstanding hereby permitted shall be made of porous materials, or provision made to direct surface water run-off to a permeable or porous area or surface within the application site before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use.",
    "Condition : 5 - Cycle Parking  - Details to be Submitted - Prior to first use of the front garden parking hereby approved, details of secure cycle parking facilities for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The approved facilities shall be fully implemented and thereafter retained for use at all times.",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIt is Council policy for the Council's contractor to construct new vehicular accesses. The applicant should contact the Council's Highways Team on 020 8545 3829 prior to any work starting to arrange for this work to be done. If the applicant wishes to undertake this work the Council will require a deposit and the applicant will need to cover all the Council's costs (including supervision of the works). If the works are of a significant nature, a Section 278 Agreement (Highways Act 1980) will be required and the works must be carried out to the Council's specification.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - Informative (Crossover Drainage) - London Borough of Merton requires a drainage channel across the full hard standing area which must drain to soft landscaping or a formulated soakaway for all vehicle crossover applications. The  drainage channel must be installed between the Hard Standing and the councils footway where the hard standing slopes towards the highway and where an open granular surfacing has not been constructed as a finished surface. Block Paving, resin surfacing, Hard Rolled fine granular surfacing and all close bound semi-pervious solutions can all clog up over time and have increased the water runoff from private property. In acceptance of this and to comply with Sec 163. Highways Act 1980, all Vehicle crossover applications must be supported by a drainage channel. Where an extension to an existing crossover is requested the drainage channel must be for the new full width including any previously approved crossover.",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable after requested amendments were submitted.\r\n   ii) The application was approved with an agreed extension of time.\r\n   \r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nAny works/events carried out either by, or at the behest of, the developer, whether they are located on, or affecting a prospectively maintainable highway, as defined under Section 87 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, or on or affecting the public highway, shall be co-ordinated under the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic management Act 2004 and licensed accordingly in order to secure the expeditious movement of traffic by minimising disruption to users of the highway network in Merton. Any such works or events commissioned by the developer and particularly those involving the connection of any utility to the site, shall be co-ordinated by them in liaison with the London Borough of Merton, Network Coordinator, (telephone 020 8545 3976). This must take place at least one month in advance of the works and particularly to ensure that statutory undertaker connections/supplies to the site are co-ordinated to take place wherever possible at the same time.\r\n"
