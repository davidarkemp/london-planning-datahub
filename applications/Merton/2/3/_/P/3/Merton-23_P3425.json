    "Reason : 1 - The proposed vehicular crossover and associated works by reason of its unsatisfactory siting, layout and loss of grass verge would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to postiviely contribute to the visual amenity of the street scene to the detirment of the ovaerall setting and appearance of the host dwelling, adjoining dwellings and the local character, contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, Chapters 4, 12 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 (Design) of Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments) and DM D3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed vehicular crossover due to its unsatisfactory siting and layout failing to allow a vehicle to enter and exit in forward gear would adversely impact on the free flow of vehicle traffic, free flow of pedestrian and cycling traffic to the detriment of highway safety.. This would be contrary to, in particular, Chapter 9 of the NPPF 2023,  London Plan 2021,  Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Core Planning Strategy policy CS18 and CS20, and Policies DMD2 and DMT2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of loss of grass verge and absence of replacement landscaping, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposals would not have a detrimental impact on the biodiversity of the borough. This proposal would not ensure landscape features are protected therefore undermining the London Borough of Merton's efforts to conserve and enhance the natural environment contrary to, in particlar, Chapter 15 of the NPPF 2023, London Plan Policy G7, Policy CS13 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DMD2 and DMO2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
