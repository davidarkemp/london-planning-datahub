    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its height and scale, is considered to be an excessive and over dominant form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing site and wider Wimbledon Hill Road Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton's Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and Policies CS 13 and CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its height, scale and proximity to neighbouring boundaries, is considered to be an excessive and over dominant form of development which would result in a harmful impact on the amenity of the adjoining neighbouring property at No.1 Mansel Road by reason of loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton's Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and Policies CS 13 and CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
