    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of the front window opening and intensification of use fails to protect proposed and existing occupiers' privacy and would result in unacceptable overlooking and loss of privacy and potential noise and disturbance to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD2 (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of unsatisfactory layout, inadequate internal floor space and lack of provision of external amenity space represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 and DM H1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015 The proposals would fail to comply with policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy D6 and D7 of the London Plan (2021).(2021) ",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus failed to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a water usage statement and an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use and would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1, SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain, contrary to, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - Informative: The scale bar is inaccurate and measurement annotations are only available on select drawings. Officers have used alternative maps to measure the outbuilding and rear garden footprint.\r\n"
