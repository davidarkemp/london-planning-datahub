    "Reason : 1 - The extension by reason of its combined unacceptable siting, depth, width, design, scale, form and massing, would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that would destroy the appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding. The extension fails to achieve a high standard of design. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the displaced off-street parking space would not adversely impact street parking and highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CS20 of the Merton Core Strategy (2011) and Policies DM T2, DMT3 and DM T5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE: There are a number of inaccuracies in the drawings. The side window serving the shower room is not sited consistently across proposed drawings. The pitch roof is not shown on proposed rear elevations. The width of the main dwelling (4m) on the proposed front and rear elevations is wider (4.7m) than shown on all other drawings. The width of the extension is not consistent on the proposed front elevation. "
