    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, increase in ridge height and part 1 part 2 side extension would appear incongruous and visually dominant in the streetscene and is considered harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding Conservation Area. The proposals are therefore considered to fail to comply with the principles of policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D3 DM D4 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3, D4, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its siting, proximity to trees and in the absence of sufficient arboricultural information, has failed to demonstrate that the scheme would safeguard the health and longevity of all adjacent trees to the detriment of biodiversity, the visual amenity of the locality and thus fail to preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the conservation area.  The scheme is thereby contrary to the NPPF and, in particular policies DM O2, DM D1, DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies G6 and G7 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\nThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
