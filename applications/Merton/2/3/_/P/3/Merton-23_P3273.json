    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of two family sized units (3b 4p minimum), thereby failing to comply with Core Strategy policy CS14 and Policy H2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front elevation alterations including changes to fenestration, by reason of design and detailing would fail to achieve a high standard of design, being an unsympathetic addition to the host properties and failing to respond positively to the character and appearance of the Lower Morden Lane street scene, contrary to policies DMD2 (Design considerations in all developments) & DMD3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) of Merton's Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy CS14 (Design) of Merton's Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) & D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers of flats 3, 4, and 5 due to inadequate internal. The scheme would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015 The proposals would fail to comply with policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) ",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of insufficient private external amenity space and lack of justification as to why it cannot be provided, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the additional units and occupancy on site, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus failed to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 9 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
