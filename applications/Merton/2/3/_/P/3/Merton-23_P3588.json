    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its scale, form and appearance would fail to be subservient to the existing terrace and would therefore have a detrimental impact on the character of the site and surrounding conservation area.

    "Reason : 2 - The access to the upstairs flat of the property adjacent (no. 25) would also be compromised by the proposed development as the new dwelling would adopt the flank wall of the adjacent block. As such, the proposal would exhibit sub-standard design and negatively impacting the amenity of this property contrary to Merton Sites and Policies (2014)",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of evidence explaining the residual parking arrangements for no. 23 and 25 Lancaster Road, the proposal is considered to fall contrary to Merton SPP policy DMT3 by failing to provide suitable amount of parking to serve the wider site.",
