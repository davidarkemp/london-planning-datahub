    "Reason : 1 - The proposed amenity space by reason of its design and siting would result in a visually obtrusive, prominent and incongruous form of development that would adversely impact the character and appearance of the surrounding area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, National Planning Policy Framework (2023) Chapters 4 and 12,London Plan (2021) Policies D3, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed amenity space to the rear of the L-shaped dormer for the first floor self-contained flat by reason of its siting is considered to increase perceived overlooking opportunities and have a material impact to the ground floor flat and first floor flat at No. 16 Finborough Road, and No. 12 Finborough Road. The proposal is also considered to have a negative impact due to the increased opportunities to stay for prolonged periods on the balcony therefore creating noise to the detriment of the adjoining dwellings. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, National Planning Policy Framework (2023) Chapters 4 and12, London Plan (2021) Policies D3, Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3.

    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did engage in pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
