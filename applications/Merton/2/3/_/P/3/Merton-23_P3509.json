    "Reason : 1 - The proposed porch by reason of its combined design, massing and siting forward of the established front building line would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would adversely impact on the appearance of the host property and the terrace row that it forms a part to the detriment of the visual amenity of the streetscene and surrounding area.  The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, the London Plan (2021) design policies D1, D4, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of absence of proposed site layout, it is considered that the proposed porch by reason of its combined siting and depth would result in a reduced frontage that would impact on existing off-street parking provision and thus the scheme is considered to potentially increase pressure on on-street parking to the detriment of the free flow of traffic in the locality and highway and pedestrian safety. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, London Plan (2021) policy T6 Car Parking, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM T2 Transport impact of development, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policies CS 18 Transport, CS 20 Parking, Servicing and Delivery. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
