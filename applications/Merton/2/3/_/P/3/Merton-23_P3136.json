    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting and design coupled with complete loss of rear garden area results in a visually intrusive, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to achieve a high standard of design destroying the form, proportion and appearance of the host dwelling and the appearance of the terraced properties that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and draft policies D12.1, D12.3 of Merton Draft Local Plan 2022",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the unacceptable layout the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Core Strategy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and insufficient private amenity space the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, Policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM H1 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, the scheme fails to promote a sustainable form of transport contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy T5 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy 2011",
    "Reason : 6 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would minimise water usage rates as well as include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011",

    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the increase in parking demand, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on-street parking to the detriment of the free flow of traffic in the locality and highway and pedestrian safety and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to highway safety and sustainable transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.
