    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the external amenity area for future occupiers represents over-intensification and over-development of the site failing to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers of the HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, London Plan (2021) Policy H9, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS14, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) DMH5 and DM D2 and London Borough of Merton Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) Requirements (Revised July 2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - The development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to, in particular, policy  DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and visual amenity of the locality. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 4 - Due to the limited information submitted within the FRA and the failure to incorporate sustainable drainage, the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nYou shall be made aware that the works refused in this application do not have permission and as such an enforcement case shall be open and officers shall review next steps on formal enforcement action unless remedied",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
