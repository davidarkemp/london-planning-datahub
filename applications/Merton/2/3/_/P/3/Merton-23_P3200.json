    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension with gabled roof work, rear dormer, and PV panel installation, by reason of their combined width, massing and design would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, unsympathetic, incongruous and cramped form of overdevelopment that fails to relate to the character, appearance, form and proportion of the host building, the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding street scene and area in general. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, the London Plan design policies D1, D4, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
