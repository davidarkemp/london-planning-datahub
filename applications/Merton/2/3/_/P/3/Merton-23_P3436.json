    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front gables, by reason of design and detailing, would fail to achieve a high standard of design, being an unsympathetic addition to the host property and failing to respond positively to the character and appearance of the Glenthorpe Road street scene, contrary to policies DMD2  & DMD3 of Merton's Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy CS14 of Merton's Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3  & D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension by reason of its combined unacceptable siting, design, depth and width would result in an incongruous, prominent and unsympathetic form of development that fails to respect the form and proportion of the host dwelling and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the appearance and visual amenity of the host site and locality.  The proposal would therefore fail to accord with London plan policies D3 and D4, Merton Core Strategy policy CS14 and Merton's Sites and Policies Plan DM D2 and DM D3 in respect of character and appearance.  The proposal would therefore fail to accord with London plan policies D3 and D4, Merton Core Strategy policy CS14 and Merton's Sites and Policies Plan DM D2 and DM D3 in respect of character and appearance.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular,11 Glenthorpe Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD2.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a complete Flood Risk Assessment that includes assessment on potential impact and structural integrity of Ply Brook, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
