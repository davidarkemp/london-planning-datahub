    "Reason : 1 - The single storey side/rear extension by reason of its combined unacceptable siting, depth, width, design, scale, form and massing and external materials, would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development. The proposal fails to achieve a high standard of design. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a swept path analysis to demonstrate the rear parking spaces can be accommodated, it is considered the parking space would adversely impact on free movement to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety in the locality and would be contrary to, in particular, Policy DMT2 and T5 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
