    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer above the two-storey outrigger, owing to its design and siting, is considered to result in a dominant and incongruous form of development to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with polices D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of The Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear dormer above the outrigger, by reason of its design, height, scale, form and proximity to 74 Adela Avenue would be considered an unneighbourly form of development and would create an increased sense of enclosure  and harmful loss of light toward neighbour occupiers rear windows at first floor. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"              Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"              Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"              As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"              The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"              It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"              The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
