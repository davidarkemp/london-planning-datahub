    "Reason : 1 - By reason of absence of satisfactory evidence to demonstrate the use of the outbuilding to be ancillary to the host dwelling unit, the scheme falls outside the scope of a householder development and is thus considered to result in unacceptable intensification of use to the detriment of the residential amenity of the nearby occupants as well as adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal would therefore fail to accord with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D1, and D4 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a satisfactory flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The combined siting, height, width and depth results in an incongruous form of development that fails to reflect the residential character or the pattern of development of the locality.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Chapter 4 and 12 of the NPPF 2023, Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of Core Strategy 2011 and Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of satisfactory evidence to demonstrate the use of the outbuilding to be ancillary to the host dwelling unit, the application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain, contrary to, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Environment Act 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThere are inaccurate measurements labelled in the set of drawings which are different when using the scale guidance. Had the application been recommended for approval, clarifications would have been sought. "
