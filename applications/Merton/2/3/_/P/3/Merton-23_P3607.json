    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension addition,  by reason of the design, position, bulk and massing, represents an unneighbourly form of development that would; i) be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive leading to a sense of enclose to the detriment of the amenity of adjoining neighbours and ii) would fail to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, scale, proportions and massing of the existing and surrounding buildings, and as such would be contrary to London Plan policy D3, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe site owner is required to comply with any Building Regulations and Environmental Health requirements in relation to the positioning of the existing flue, notwithstanding this planning application.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application . \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
