    "Reason : 2 - The prior approval date would fall after 10th June 2019, which means the development would not comply with Paragraph P.1(c) of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class P of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area with high parking pressure. In the absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement, the proposal would not comply with paragrapgh P.2,(b)(ii) of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class P of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).  ",
    "Reason : 4 - Given the nature of the existing use, the application site is a contamination risk. No evidence has been submitted with the application demonstating that there is no contamination risk and as such the proposal does not comply with paragraph P.2, (b)(iii) of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class P of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).
