    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension to accommodate the provision of a new dwelling by reason of its combined siting, design, height and width results in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to reflect the form and proportion of the dwellings along the terrace row that the site forms a part thus destroys the uniformity of the terrace row to the detriment of the character and appearance of the St Helier Avenue street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The combined loss of the soft landscaping and boundary treatment to Rose Avenue would increase visual permeability into a predominately hard surfaced parking area which fails to positively contribute to the visual amenity of the Rose Avenue streetscene contrary to, in particular, DMD2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of an arboricultural survey, arboricultural impact assessment and arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the proposal is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing trees to the rear/side of the site to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and insufficient private and easily accessible private amenity space the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, Policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM H1 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",

The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, Policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM H1 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a site specific flood risk assessment commensurate to the\r\nnature and scale of the development the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2. \r\n",

    "Reason : 6 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the bike stores, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is informed that the proposal involves work to land outside of the application site.  Had the scheme been considered acceptable, a corrected Site Location Plan and Ownership Certificate would have been requested.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework, Merton Borough Council takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\n{\\b o} Providing a formal pre-application and duty officer service\r\n{\\b o} Providing written policies and guidance, all of which is available to view on the Council's website\r\n{\\b o} Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision\r\n{\\b o} Determining applications in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n{\\b o} The applicants did not seek formal pre-application advice, and the scheme was found to be contrary to policy and guidance, and subsequently refused. The Council is ready to enter into discussions to advise the applicants of relevant policy and guidance; and where possible assist in the preparation of a new planning permission through the formal pre-application advice service.\r\n"
