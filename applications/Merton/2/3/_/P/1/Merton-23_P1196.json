    "Reason : 1 - This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED. This is because the construction of the proposed roof results in works that amount to demolition and re-construction, as such it does not meet criteria laid down in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and any subsequent legislative amendments.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE: Had the application been considered as a genuine extension to the existing roof extension, the application would have been considered to exceed the 50 m3 enlarged roof volume as such would not have complied with B (d) (ii) of Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE: Had the application been considered as a genuine extension to the existing roof extension, The rear window for the rear hip to gable conversion would not match the appearance of the materials used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse as such would not have complied with B.2 (a) of Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Reason : 5 - Had the application been considered as a genuine extension to the existing roof extension, The proposed windows on the side elevation of the two proposed dormer are proposed to be opening below 1.7m above the floor level of the proposed habitable loft. Additionally, the side windows would not be obscure glazed.  As such the proposed windows would not have complied with B.2 (c) (i) and (ii) of Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
