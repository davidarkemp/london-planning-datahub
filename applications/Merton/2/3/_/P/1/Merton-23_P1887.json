    "Reason : 1 - The proposed detached dwellinghouse, by reason of its design, proportions, siting and layout, would be considered unsympathetic form of development sitting uncomfortably and awkwardly with the Coach house and 57 Langdale Avenue. It would fail to introduce a dwelling of high quality design which would complement or positively contribute to the Langdale Avenue streetscene and compromise views from the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area on Commonside West. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DMD1, DMD2 and DMD4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of confirmation of the retention of the existing front boundary wall, the scheme would increase visual permeability into a predominately hard surfaced forecourt which fails to positively contribute to the amenity of the Langdale Avenue streetscene contrary to DMD2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a satisfactory Heritage Statement, the applicant has failed to set out an understanding of the potential impact of the proposal on their significance contrary to the aims and objectives of chapter 16 of the NPPF 2021 and policy DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that the additional dwelling is prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking enclosure the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated cycle parking facilities, contrary to policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a water usage statement and an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use and would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality and demonstrate provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1, SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 7 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021."
