    "Reason : 1 - Due to inaccurate drawings the council are unable to ascertain the impact on the character and appearance of the host site or the surrounding area nor are they able to assess the impact on neighbour amenity. It is therefore concluded that the proposal would fail to comply with the principles of policies DMD2 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of satisfactory replacement front boundary treatment, the proposal fails to provide a separation between the site and the public footway and would increase visual permeability into a predominantly hard surfaced area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. This would be contrary to London Plan Policy D3, Core Planning Strategy policy CS14 and Policy DMD2 of the Sites and Policies Plan.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of visibility splay, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposals would not have a detrimental impact to highways and pedestrian safety and vehicular movement along Manor Road. This would be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy T6, Core Planning Strategy policy CS18 and CS20, and Policies DMD2 and DMT2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of Tree Survey, Arboricultural impact assessment, Arboricultural method statement and Tree Protection plan. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposals would not have a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of the on-site tree and street tree adjacent to the proposed vehicle crossover. This proposal would not ensure trees and landscape features are protected therefore undermining the London Borough of Merton's efforts to conserve and enhance the natural environment contrary to London Plan Policy G7, Policy CS13 of the Core Planning Strategy and Policy DMD2 and DMO2 of the Sites and Policies Plan, and London Borough of Merton Tree Strategy 2023 - 2029.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe submitted LBM Footway Crossing Application No: 013258, does not reflect the location of the submitted drawings. The Applicant should make contact with Highways 02085422761 to get a replacement LBM Footway Crossing Application. ",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n"
