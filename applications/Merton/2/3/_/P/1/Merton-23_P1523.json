    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, rear dormer roof extension and side access stairs by reason of their combined unacceptable siting, design, width, bulk and mass results in an incongruous, visually obtrusive and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to be in keeping with the appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies DMD2 (Design considerations in all developments) & DMD3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) of Merton's Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy CS14 (Design) of Merton's Core Strategy (2011), Draft Policies D12.2 and D12.3 of the Draft Merton Local Plan 2022 and policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) & D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional dwellings over and above the number of units currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable layout the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in\r\nsub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme thereby fails to meet the requirements of, in particular, policies D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS14 of the Site's and Policies Plan.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Draft Policies CC2.1 and CC2.2 of the Draft Merton Local Plan 2022",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
