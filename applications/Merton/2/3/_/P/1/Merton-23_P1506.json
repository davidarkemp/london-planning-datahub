    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the provision of a self-contained residential unit at basement level within flood zone 2, the scheme fails to comply with the principle set out in, in particular Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM F1 and the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed basement, by reason of its combined depth and excessive lightwells to both the front and rear elevations results in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of overdevelopment that fails to respect the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, policies DMD2 (Design considerations in all developments) & DMD3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) of Merton's Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy CS14 (Design) of Merton's Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) & D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and insufficient floor to ceiling height, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a construction method statement, it has not be satisfactorily demonstrated that the scheme will safeguard the free flow of traffic in the locality and thus is considered to be detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, planning policies CS14 and CS20 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DMT2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a construction method statement, it has not be satisfactorily demonstrated that the scheme will safeguard the free flow of traffic in the locality and thus is considered to be detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, planning policies CS14 and CS20 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DMT2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of required cycle parking spaces, the proposal fails to promote sustainable form of travel contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies Core Strategy Policy CS18 and London Plan Policy T5.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a satisfactory Basement Impact Assessment including detailed drainage information, details for safe implementation of basement construction, detailed drainage details and flood mitigation for increased runoff being managed through SuDS, the proposal fails to safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality and thus fails to accord with the criteria set out in, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 Policies DM F2 and DM D2.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a water usage statement and an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use as well as include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
