    "Reason : 1 - Prior approval is REQUIRED and REFUSED.  The proposals fails to accord with criteria A.4(3)(b) as in the absence of accurate dimensions, the developer has provided insufficient information to enable the authority to establish whether the proposed development complies with, the conditions, limitations or restrictions applicable to development permitted by Class A which exceeds the limits in paragraph A.1(f) but is allowed by paragraph A.1(g).  The proposal fails to demonstrate it would comply with the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. A resubmission with correct complete information would therefore be required. ",
    "Reason : 2 - Prior approval is REQUIRED and REFUSED.  The proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with criteria A.4(7) of Class A, Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).  The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of the adjoining occupants, in particular, nos. 141 and 145 Whatley Avenue. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  "
