    "Reason : 1 -  The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its combined siting and scale is considered to represent an unsympathetic form of development that would result in the loss of openness in this corner which is characteristic of the estate that the site forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. Therefore, the scheme would be contrary to, in particular, Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).\r",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its combined siting, depth and height is considered to represent an overbearing, visually intrusive and dominant form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and potentially cause unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular No. 7 Netley Gardens. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, Policies DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan."
