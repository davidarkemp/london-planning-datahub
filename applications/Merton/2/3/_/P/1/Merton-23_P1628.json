  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - Due to the existing impermeable paving and the absence of detailing regarding the installed runoff, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its siting and absence of a tree protection plan, arboricultural impact assessment, arboricultural method statement, the scheme results in an unsustainable form of development that could adversely impact on the health and longevity of existing street tree to the detriment of the ecological benefit, natural environment and visual amenity of the locality. The scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy G7, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS13 and Policies DMD2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
