    "Reason : 1 - The proposed works to create two new outdoor pergolas for the public house for patrons would result in noise disturbance to the occupants of the nearby residential properties and their rear gardens to the detriment of their amenity and enjoyment of their gardens. Further, in the absence of elevations and plant details of the proposed outdoor fridge, this element would cause a harmful impact on the amenities of surrounding residential occupiers. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy DM D2 of the Merton Site and Policies Plan 2014.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.  \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
