    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its scale, form, design and siting would fail to respect the rhythm, scale, materials and architectural design of the host building and terrace, giving rise to an overly bulky development, resulting in material harm to the character of the host building, the terrace of which it forms a part and the wider streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would significantly reduce the available rear/side garden external amenity space for 376 Bishopford Road, which, by reason of fencing, currently enjoys a meaningful degree of privacy to the benefit of existing occupiers, and would thereby materially diminish the amenities of existing and future occupants of 376 Bishopsford Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD2.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would be visually overbearing and create an unwelcome sense of enclosure, and overlooking to occupiers at 103 Malmesbury Road and be visually overbearing and create an unwelcome sense of enclosure to occupiers at 376 Bishopsford Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD2.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed unit, by reason of size, would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of lack of information on furniture arrangments, is considered to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space. It would therefore be contrary to London Plan policy D6, Merton Core Strategy 2011 policies CS9& CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DMD2"
