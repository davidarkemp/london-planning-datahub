    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mansard roof extension would have a form that would be bulky as would be evident from its expansive crown, excessive height and incongruous to the host building. As such, it would adversely affect the character of the host building and would detract from the appearance of the street scene. Therefore, proposed mansard roof extension would fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Site and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed mansard roof extension by reason of its rear facing windows would cause overlooking harm to the neighbouring occupiers of 119 and 121 Pelham Road. Therefore, proposed mansard roof extension would fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Site and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
