    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of satisfactory evidence to demonstrate the loss of floorspace to Class E ground floor unit would not adversely impact on the vitality and viability of the commercial unit and Colliers Wood Neighbourhood Parade the scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM E1, DM R4 and DM R1 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The first floor rear extension by reason of its combined unacceptable siting, depth, width, design, scale, form and massing, fails to achieve a high standard of design. It would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that would destroy the appearance, form and proportion of the host building and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of combined siting, height and depth the development results in a visually obtrusive and overbearing form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and result in overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular no. 35 and 31 High Street Colliers Wood .  The scheme is contrary to in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).   ",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a noise and odour assessment it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the residential amenity of nearby occupants will be safeguarded.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policies DM D2, DM EP2 and DM R5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).    ",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of the unacceptable layout, insufficient private external amenity space and lack of justification as to why it cannot be provided, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a site specific flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 7 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the bike store, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a water usage statement and an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use and would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1, SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 9 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE: Officers have updated the description of development to more accurately reflect the proposals. ",
    "Reason : 11 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
