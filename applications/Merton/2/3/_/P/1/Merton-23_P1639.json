    "Reason : 1 - The proposed decking and steps, by reason of their combined siting, depth and height and absence of suitable mitigation measures would result in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, nos.44 and 48 Marina Avenue in terms of causing loss of privacy and overlooking.  The scheme would be contrary to, in particular,  the London Plan design policies D1, D4, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
