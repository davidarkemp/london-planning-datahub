    "Reason : 1 - This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED. This is because it does not meet criteria laid down in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and any subsequent legislative amendments. \r\n\r\nThe proposed scheme fails to comply with the requirements of condition A.3 (a) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), as the proposed extension as the applicant has failed to demonstrate the materials used in any exterior work would be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Prior approval is REQUIRED and REFUSED.  The proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (GPDO) 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth results in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no.36 and no. 40 Marina Avenue.  The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
