    "Condition : 4 - The proposed development shall be carried out in accordance with the flood mitigation and resilience measures set out in the submitted Flood Risk Assessment, carried out by Aegaea Ltd.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure satisfactory means of surface water drainage, to reduce the risk of flooding and to comply with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS16 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM F2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r",

In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off-site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of ground water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).\r\n",
