    "Reason : 1 - A representation has been received, as required by the 'The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2015', the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required to assess the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of any adjoining premises. On assessment, the proposed extension by reason of its combined height, depth and siting is considered to appear unduly overbearing, visually intrusive and un-neighbourly, detrimental to the amenities enjoyed by the occupants of the adjoining properties at 31 & 35 Caesars Walk. The proposal would be contrary to, in particular, policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
