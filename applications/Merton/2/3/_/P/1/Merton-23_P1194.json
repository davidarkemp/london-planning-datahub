    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mansard roof extension due to its design, height, siting, massing and bulk would result in an overly dominant, visually intrusive, incongruous and inappropriate form of development, unsympathetic to and harmful to the appearance of the existing building and general pattern of development in the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DM D2 Design considerations in all developments of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan, DM D3 Alterations to existing buildings and  CS 14 (Design) of Merton's Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed mansard roof extension, by reason of its design, height, scale, form and proximity to 17 Lyveden Road would be considered an unneighbourly form of development and would create an increased sense of enclosure and harmful loss of light toward neighbouring occupiers rear windows. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
