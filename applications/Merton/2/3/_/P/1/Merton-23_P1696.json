  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, design, height, width, scale, massing, bulk and height results in a visually intrusive, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to achieve a high standard of design destroying the form, proportion and appearance of the host dwelling and the appearance of the semi-detached pair that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and draft policies D12.1, D12.3 of Merton Draft Local Plan 2022",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in a visually intrusive, overbearing and dominant form of development that would create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 57 Seddon road, Morden. The proposals would be contrary, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of combined unacceptable siting within the Root Protection Area of existing off-site tree and failure to demonstrate the scheme can co-exist sustainably without increasing pressure to excessive pruning, the scheme is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing off-site tree to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within, in particular, policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of accurate drawings confirming works to the front garden boundary including the retention of existing front garden tree, the proposal is not considered to safeguard the visual amenity of the locality, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within, in particular, policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014, the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
