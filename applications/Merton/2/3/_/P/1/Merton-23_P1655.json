    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear roof dormer extension involving raising the ridge height by 300mm would, by reason of its combined siting, height, design and use of inappropriate materials at roof level results in a visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that fails to respect the appearance of the existing dwelling and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.
