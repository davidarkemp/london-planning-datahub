    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due to its combined design, height, siting and massing, would result in a discordant, bulky and obtrusive form of overdevelopment that would fail to respect the character and appearance of the host site and the cul-du-sac in which it lies in. The development therefore harms the character and appearance of the building and surrounding area, contrary to, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM D2 and DM D3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan 2021 policies D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of substandard design and layout would result in an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation providing poor levels of daylight and outlook to a habitable room. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to, in particular, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed two-storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, height and depth would result in a visually intrusive, overbearing form of development that would result in loss of outlook and potential impact on daylight and sunlight to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular no. 10 Jonson Close.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 policy D3, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
