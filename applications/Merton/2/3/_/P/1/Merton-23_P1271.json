    "Reason : 1 - The proposed part 1, part 2 rear extension by reason of its design and massing would result in a bulky and incongruous addition for the site which would be harmful to the character of the locally listed building and surrounding conservation area. As such the proposals are considered to fail to comply with DM D2 and DM D4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan and HC1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its flat roofed design, width, height and 6m depth would be overbearing and cause overshadowing for 9 Ridgway. As such the impact on neighbouring amenity is considered unacceptable and fails to comply with DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan."
