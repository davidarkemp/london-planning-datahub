    "Reason : 1 - The front porch by reason of its combined design, siting, height, width and depth results in a visually intrusive, incongruous, prominent and dominant form of development that fails to harmonise with the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the terrace row that its forms a part of and the visual amenity of the locality. The proposal is therefore be contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nYou shall be made aware that the council have a planning enforcement case ref no 23/E0084 and officers may review formal action if the breach is not remedied",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nFollowing Officer's site visit, it is noted that the submitted drawings do not accurately reflect that as-built front porch.  The drawings have omitted the canopy and external lighting.  Had the scheme been considered acceptable, an accurate set of drawings would have been requested.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
