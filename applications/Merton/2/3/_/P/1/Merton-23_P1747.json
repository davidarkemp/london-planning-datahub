    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions, by reason of the its combined siting, design, height, depth and width results in a dominant, cramped and congested form of overdevelopment that would cause harm to the host site and local area resulting a negative impact to the character and appearance to the host site and terrace in which it forms a part of, contrary to, in particular, London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Due to inaccurate drawings of the rear dormer the council are unable to ascertain the impact on the character and appearance of the host site or the surrounding area nor are they able to assess the impact on neighbour amenity. It is therefore concluded that the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable layout, insufficient floor to ceiling height and insufficient private amenity space the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The proposals would fail to comply with, in particular, policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal by reason of its combined siting, scale, bulk and mass results in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants. The scheme is contrary to policy DMD2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014)",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
