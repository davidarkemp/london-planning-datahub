    "Reason : 1 - Under schedule 2, Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), the Local Planning authority has determined that prior approval is required and hereby REFUSED as to the siting and appearance of the proposed development for the following reason:\r\n\r\nThe proposal, by reason of its prominent siting and height would result in an unduly dominant, incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that would adversely affect the character and appearance of the locality, the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area and would cause harm to the nearby Grade II* Listed Mitcham Parish Church and nearby locally listed Benedicts primary school through development within their setting.  The scheme results in harm that would not be outweighed by the public benefits of the scheme.   As such, the proposal is considered contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (in particular paras 115 and 117), London Plan policies HC1, and policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - IUnder schedule 2, Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), the Local Planning authority has determined that prior approval is required and hereby REFUSED due to tree/biodiversity impact of the proposed development for the following reason: \r\n\r\nThe proposal, by reason of its siting, scale, proximity to trees and in the absence of sufficient arboricultural information, has failed to demonstrate that there will be no detrimental impact on the helath and long term preservation of adjacent trees to remain or biodiversity and thus the character and appearance of the locality. The scheme is thereby contrary to the NPPF and, in particular policies DM O2, DM D1, DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies G6 and G7 of the London Plan.\r\n\r\n"
