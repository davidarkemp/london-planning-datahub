    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front extension by reason of its combined siting and design would result in an unsympathetic, visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that would destroy the pattern of development, character and appearance of the host property and the row of terrace it belongs to and the Feltham Road streetscene. The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of, in particular, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its siting, design, size, scale and mass would result in an unsympathetic, visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that fails to harmonise with the pattern of development of the locality, the character and appearance of the host property and the row of terrace it belongs to. The proposal would fail to accord with the, in particular, principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in a visually intrusive, overbearing and dominant form of development that would create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 83 and 87 Feltham Road. The proposals would be contrary, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
