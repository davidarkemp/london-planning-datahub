    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its combined siting, design, depth, bulk, mass, depth and roof form would result in a visually intrusive, incongruous, dominant, contrived and cramped form of overdevelopment that fails to harmonise with the character and appearance of the streetscene to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme is in conflict with, in particular, Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its combined siting in proximity to the boundary, height and depth results in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would adversely impact on the outlook and create a sense of enclosure to nearby occupants, in particular, the occupiers of nos.27-35 Norfolk Road, contrary to, in particular, Policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout comprising narrow and long access to the bike store and rear amenity space, enclosed by close board fencing, in close proximity to residential windows and an open refuse storage area, the scheme would result in overlooking and loss of privacy to the detriment of the residential amenity of future occupants.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a a net biodiversity gain, contrary to Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would discharge rainwater to a surface water sewer or drain, contrary to London Plan policy SI 13, CS policy CS16 and SPP policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional dwellings over and above the number of units currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
