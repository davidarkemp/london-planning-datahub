    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined unacceptable siting, design and height, in particular the awkward roof design and front dormer would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of overdevelopment that fails to reflect the appearance and character of this backland site and surrounding area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of inadequate floor to ceiling heights would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers of the dwellinghouse. It would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, design, height, bulk and mass would result in a dominant, visually intrusive, overbearing form of development that would adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 policy D3, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
