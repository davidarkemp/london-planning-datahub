    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions by reason of its combined siting, design, height, width, scale, mass and form would result in an incongruous, unsympathetic and visually dominant form of development that fails to respect the appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling, the terrace row that it forms a part of and the visual amenity of the street scene, contrary to policy CS14 (Design) of the Core Planning Strategy 2011, policies DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments) and DM D3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment, the proposal is considered to adversely impact on the risk of flooding in the locality contrary to, in particular, policy CS16 (Design) of the Core Planning Strategy 2011, policies DM F1 (Support for flood risk management) considerations in all developments) and DM F2 (Sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS) and; Wastewater and water Infrastructure) of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies SI 12 (Flood risk management) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
