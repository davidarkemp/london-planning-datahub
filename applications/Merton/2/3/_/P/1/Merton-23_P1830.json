    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of satisfactory marketing evidence to confirm the lack of demand of existing use and/or other employment generating uses and community uses for a period of 18 months, the scheme is considered contrary to, in particular, Merton Local Plan (2024) Policy EC13.3.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of combined design, height, bulk and massing the proposed development results in a unsympathetic, incongruous and cramped form of overdevelopment that fails to make a positive contribution to the visual amenity of Church Road and fails to preserve or enhance the setting character and appearance of  Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area.  In addition, there are no public benefit that outweighs the harm identified.  The scheme is therefore in conflict with, in particular, Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies D12.2 and D12.5 of Merton Local Plan (2024) and the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a s106 legal agreement securing the required financial contribution towards affordable housing or a financial viability assessment to justify the lack of, the scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan (2024). \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of combined height, bulk and massing and introduction of balconies, the scheme is considered to result in a visually obtrusive and overbearing form of development that would adversely impact on the outlook from nearby occupants, create unacceptable sense of enclosure as well as result in unacceptable overlooking and loss of privacy to nearby occupants, in particular those at no. 16, 18 and 20 Love Lane and 80 Church Road, and thus the scheme fails to accord with the aims and objectives of, in particular, Policy D12.3 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of the unsatisfactory layout, in particular at ground floor level, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy D12.3 of Merton Local Plan (2024), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of absence of necessary Energy Statement and the scheme failing to achieve Zero Carbon and the absence of a legal agreement to secure the required carbon offset fund the scheme fails to provide a sustainable and energy efficient scheme contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policy CC2.2 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 8 - The application has failed to demonstrate a net gain in biodiversity by incorporating ecologically friendly measures, as such is contrary to, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of a Fire Safety Strategy incorporating but not limited to a plan detailing appropriate positioning of fire appliances and appropriate evacuation assembly points the scheme fails to provide a safe form of development for future users contrary to, in particular, Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
