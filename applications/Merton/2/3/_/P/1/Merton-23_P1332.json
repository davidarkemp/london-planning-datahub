    "Reason : 1 - The proposed unit, by reason of size, would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of poor outlook, lack of passive ventilation and insufficient direct sunlight would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accomodation and living space. It would therefore be contrary to London Plan policy D6, Merton Core Strategy 2011 policies CS9& CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DMD2",
    "Reason : 3 - The site is within an area of critical drainage and an area at risk of surface water flooding. In the absence of a suitable SuDS report and information on surface water flooding impacts, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of flooding and surface water runoff, contrary to Policies SI 13 and D10 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS 16 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM F2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, the proposal does not include measures to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral nor does the proposal include provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1, SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
