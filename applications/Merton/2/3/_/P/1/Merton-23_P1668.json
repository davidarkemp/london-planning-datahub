    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its form, design, character/appearance, detailing, materials, fenestration, balconies and lack of soft landscaping, has failed to achieve a high standard of design, failing to relate positively and appropriately to the context of the site, character and appearance of the area and would conflict with London Plan policies D3 and D4, Core Strategy policy CS 14 and SPP Policies DM D2 and DM D3.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, materials, height, form and sitting (proximity to the boundary) would fail to achieve a high quality design and protection of amenity resulting in material harm to the amenities of the occupiers of the host dwelling, no.64 Caesar's Walk by way of overbearing form and appearing visually overpowering and poor design quality, in conflict with Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, layout, form and sitting would fail to achieve a high quality design and protection of amenity resulting in material harm to the amenities of future occupants of the development byway of an unwelcoming and oppressive ground floor environment (including excessive hard standing and sense of enclosure), in conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The over-provision of car parking would encourage reliance on non-sustainable modes of transport and the application fails to demonstrate that the development proposals would not increase road danger, in conflict with Policies T4 and T6.1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS18 and CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM T3 and DM T5 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate, with a lack of information being provided, that the development would comply with adopted planning policies and that the development would not have a harmful impact on flooding, air quality (air quality neutral), biodiversity (net gain), green corridor, trees and sustainability in conflict with Policy SI 1, SI 2, SI 12, SI 13, G6 and G7 of the London Plan, Policy CS13, CS14, CS15, CS16 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2, DM F1, DM F2 and DM O2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
