    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions, by reason of their overall scale, design and mass would represent disproportionately large and incongruous additions to the host building, causing harm to its character and the character of the surrounding area. As such the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Site and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front extension, by reason of its proximity to the boundary with number 42 Lake Road, would cause harm to this neighbouring occupiers amenities by having an overbearing impact. As such the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Site and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
