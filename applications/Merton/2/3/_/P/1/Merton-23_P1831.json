    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two front roof extensions and mansard roof extension by reason of its design, height, scale, bulk and form would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would appear awkward and jarring in the streetscene, failing to blend and integrate well with the main building and its existing roofscape and would have a negative impact toward the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the surrounding Lambton Road Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
