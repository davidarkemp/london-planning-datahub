    "Reason : 1 - By reason of its excessive depth, scale, height, form and parapet walls, the proposal would detrimentally block light and be overbearing to the adjoining neighbouring properties of no. 73 and 69 Stuart Road that will be detrimental to the amenities these adjoining neighbouring occupiers. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14, London Plan (2021) Policy D4 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3. ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of its scale and depth, the proposal would cause a visually harmful form of development out of keeping with the character of the site and surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14, London Plan (2021) Policy D4 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3.   ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
