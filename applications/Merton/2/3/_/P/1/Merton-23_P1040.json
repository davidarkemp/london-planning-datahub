  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of their combined siting, design, height, width and use of inappropriate materials is considered to result in an incongruous, visually obtrusive, prominent and dominant form of overdevelopment of the site that destroys the form and proportion of the host property and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme does not comply with Merton's Core Planning Strategy policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The loss of the front garden boundary in its entirety by reason of its corner plot siting would unacceptably increase visual permeability into a predominantly hard surfaced forecourt with refuse and cycle stores resulting in visual clutter to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme does not comply with Merton's Core Planning Strategy policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable internal layout the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme fails to comply with the requirements set out in, in particular, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of loss of front garden boundary treatment unsatisfactory access and parking layout, the proposal will provide sub-standard car parking spaces and manoeuvre/turning area that would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS 20 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM T2 and DM T3",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a water usage statement and an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use as well as include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
