    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding and the cycle store, by reason of their combined siting, scale and footprint is considered to result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of overdevelopment that would result in significant loss of rear garden area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.   The scheme fails to comply with SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3 and Core Strategy policy CS14.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the unacceptable layout the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  Overall, the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Core Strategy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - Had the scheme been considered as a large House in Multiple Occupation (sui generis), in the absence of a Housing Management Plan, the proposal is in conflict with Policy H16 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - Had the scheme been considered as a large House in Multiple Occupation (sui generis), by reason of lack of sufficient communal spaces in the main property, the proposal would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers for the large 9b9p HMO.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 5 - Had the scheme been considered as a large House in Multiple Occupation (sui generis), by reason of unsatisfactory siting and layout, the proposed development would also fail to provide convenient access to the occupier of \"bedroom 9\" to the main building.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a site specific flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nThe applicant is reminded that an increase in occupancy is a material change of use of the site as such the description of development has been amended to reflect this.   ",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
