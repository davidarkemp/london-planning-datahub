    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, design and depth would result in an overly dominant and unsympathetic form of development that would fail to reflect the pattern of development to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with, in particular, policies DMD2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of combined unacceptable siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 201 West Barnes Lane and potentially result in overshadowing. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
