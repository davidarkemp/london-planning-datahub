  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of satisfactory evidence to demonstrate the lack of demand for the continued use of the existing commercial use in existing or alternative employment generating and/or community uses, the loss of scattered employment sites is considered contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policy E4 of the London Plan (2021), policies DM E3 and DM R4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS3 and CS12 of Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The scheme by reason of its combined height, bulk and massing results in an incongruous, visually obtrusive, dominant and prominent form of overdevelopment that would adversely impact on the character and appearance of the area and the open character of the adjoining open space.  The scheme is therefore in conflict with, in particular, Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DMO1 and DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of tree survey, arboricultural impact assessment, arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the proposal is considered to adversely impact on the health and longevity of nearby trees to the detriment of visual amenity of the locality and biodiversity in the Borough.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM D2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and insufficient private amenity space the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "Reason : 5 - The scheme, by reason of the absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a water usage statement and an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use as well as include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 8 - The application has failed to demonstrate a net gain in biodiversity by incorporating ecologically friendly measures in the construction process, as such is contrary to, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is informed that the onus is on the applicant to ascertain land ownership and ensure the correct certificate is serve as part of any planning application."
