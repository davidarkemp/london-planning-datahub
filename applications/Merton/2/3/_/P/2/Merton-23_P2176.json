The proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with criteria A.4(7) of Class A, Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended). The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of the adjoining occupants of no.42 New Close. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). "
