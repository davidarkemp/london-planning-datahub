    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions, by reason of their combined siting, design, width, bulk and massing would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development at roof level to the detriment of the form, proportion and visual amenity of the host property, and the surrounding area in general. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, London Plan design policies D1, D4, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions, by reason of their combined siting, design, width, bulk and mass would result in a visually intrusive, unduly dominant and unsympathetic form of development that would appear overbearing to nearby occupants, in particular, no.29 Lower Morden Lane. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
