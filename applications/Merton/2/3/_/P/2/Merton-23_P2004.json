    "Reason : 1 - The rear dormer roof extension by reason of its combined siting, design and use of inappropriate materials at roof level results in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to harmonise with the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the terrace row that its forms a part of and the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal fails to accord with, in particular, the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor side roof terrace, by reason of its combined siting and design would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous design feature that fails to harmonise with the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the terrace row that its forms a part of and the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal fails to accord with, in particular, the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of loss of front boundary treatment, the proposal will increase visual permeability into a predominantly hard-surfaced forecourt which is to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality and thus fail to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and lack of appropriate floor to ceiling height, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  Overall, the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Core Strategy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a parking survey undertaken to Lambeth Methodology, it has not been demonstrated there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the overspill parking from the proposed development.  The scheme is therefore considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain, contrary to Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a site specific flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - IINFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is informed that any redundant crossovers will expected to be removed and footpath reinstated at cost to the applicant.\r\n"
