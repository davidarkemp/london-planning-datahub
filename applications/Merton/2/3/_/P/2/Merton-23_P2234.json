    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, design, height, width, scale, massing, bulk and height results in a visually intrusive, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to achieve a high standard of design destroying the form, proportion and appearance of the host dwelling and the appearance of the terraced properties that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and draft policies D12.1, D12.3 of Merton Draft Local Plan 2022",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and lack of appropriate floor to ceiling height, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. Overall, the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Core Strategy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DM D2.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and unsatisfactory access to the private amenity space for Flat B and C the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The scheme fails to meet the requirements of, in particular, policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS14 of Merton Site's and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the bike store and absence of details of satisfactory provision of Electric Vehicle Charging Points, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of unsatisfactory parking layout, the proposal results in an intensification of use of the rear access that will adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular noise and disturbance.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM D2 and DM EP2.",

The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM D2 and DM EP2.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a satisfactory site specific flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
