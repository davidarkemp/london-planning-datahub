    "Condition : 1 - By reason of the lack of details of the proposed appearance of the front and rear garden and boundary treatment, the scheme is considered to increase visual permeability into a predominantly hard surfaced forecourt to the detriment of the overall appearance of the locality.

    "Condition : 3 - In absence of a layout plan showing details of the location of the proposed parking bay, the front boundary and dropped kerb, the scheme fails to provide a satisfactory form of vehicular access to the detriment of the free flow of traffic to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety in the locality and is considered to adversely impact on the visual amenity of the locality.
