    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its height, depth, scale, design and form results in a visually intrusive, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to appear subservient to the host dwelling and fail to reflect the scale of typical outbuildings in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies 4 And 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and draft policies D12.1, D12.3 of Merton Draft Local Plan 2022.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the scheme will not result in increase of risk of flooding in the locality.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular to Policies 4 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy SI 13 of the London Plan, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a Tree survey report, Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Arboricultural Method Statement and tree protection plan, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the scheme will safeguard the health and longevity of all on and off site trees to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality, nature conservation and biodiversity of the locality.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, to chapters 4 and 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS13 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM02 and DMD2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
