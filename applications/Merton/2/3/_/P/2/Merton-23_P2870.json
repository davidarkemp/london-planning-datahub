    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, design and height would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, and incongruous form of development that fails to harmonise with the appearance of the host site and the pattern of development in the locality to the detriment to the visual amenity of the surrounding area in general. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, the London Plan design policies D1, D4, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development and create an unacceptable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 103 Marina Avenue. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, the Merton Site and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM D2 and DM D3.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
