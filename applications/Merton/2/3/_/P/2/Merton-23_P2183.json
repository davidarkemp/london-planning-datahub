    "Condition : 5 - Condition Flood Resilience measures\r\nThe following flood risk mitigation measures must be implemented prior to the occupation of the proposed development:\r\nStandard basement construction practices will protect the site from residual flood risks and these may include the following: \r\n- A raised threshold around the front and rear lightwells by at least +250mm to reduce the risk of internal flooding into the basement.\r\n- Basement to be fully waterproofed (tanked) \r\n- Plaster boards to be installed in horizontal sheets rather than conventional vertical installation methods to minimise the amount of plasterboard that could be damaged in a flood event \r\r\n- Wall sockets to be raised to as high as is practicable and sockets fed from the ceiling down in order to minimise damage if flood waters inundate the property \r\r\n- A sump area to be installed within the basement floor in the event that the basement does flood and a sump pump fitted with a non-return valve or FLIP device to prevent water backing up into the property should the mains sewer become full\r\n\r\nReason: To reduce the impact the site may experience as a result of fluvial flooding and or surface water flooding to the proposed development and future users, in accordance with Merton�s policies CS16, DMF2 and the London Plan policy SI 13 \r\r\n",
