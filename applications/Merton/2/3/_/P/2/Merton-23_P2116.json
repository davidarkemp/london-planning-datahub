    "Reason : 1 - The extension by reason of its combined unacceptable siting, depth, width, design, scale, form and massing, would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that would destroy the appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding. The extension fails to achieve a high standard of design. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of combined scale, massing and siting the development results in a visually obtrusive form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and result in overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular no. 26 Martin Way.  The scheme is contrary to in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).    ",
