    "Reason : 1 - The proposed side/rear extension by reason of its combined siting and depth results in a disproportionate and incongruous form of overdevelopment of the site that fails to reflect the pattern of development in the locality.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objective of, in particular, London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies  DMD2 and DMD3. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The combined siting and footprint of the proposed side/rear extension and outbuilding results in a disproportionate and incongruous form of overdevelopment of the site that results in excessive site coverage failing to reflect the pattern of development in the locality.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objective of, in particular, London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies  DMD2 and DMD3. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The overall combined size, height, siting and design of the outbuilding fails to reflect that of a typical garden outbuilding and thus fail to reflect the pattern of development in the locality.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objective of, in particular, London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies  DMD2 and DMD3. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed side/rear extension by reason of combined siting, height and depth results in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that will create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupiers, in particular, no. 20 Litchfield Avenue.  Further, given site orientation, it is considered that the proposal is likely to result in overshadowing in particular to the rear garden area that is most used by this occupant.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
