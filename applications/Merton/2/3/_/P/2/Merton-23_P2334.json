    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and insufficient private amenity space the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The proposal would be contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policies CS 9 & CS14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, the scheme fails to promote a sustainable form of transport contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy.",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would minimise water usage rates as well as include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",

    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a satisfactory Flood Risk Assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of proposed development and details of Sustainable Urban Drainage Scheme, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 12, CS policy CS16 and SPP policies DM F1 and DM F2.",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
