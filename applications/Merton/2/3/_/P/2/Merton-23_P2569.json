    "Reason : 1 - The single storey front extension by reason of its combined siting, design and use of inappropriate materials results in a visually intrusive, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to achieve a high standard of design destroying the form, proportion and appearance of the host shopfront and the appearance of the terraced row it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), Shop Front Guidance - Design Supplementary Planning Document 2017, and draft policies D12.1, D12.3 of Merton Draft Local Plan 2022.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
