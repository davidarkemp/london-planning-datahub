    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of the proposed roof addition would be overbearing and visually intrusive for the neighbouring properties at 72A and 74 Havelock Road. The proposals are also considered likely to result in overshadowing/loss of daylight sunlight for these neighbouring properties. The proposals are therefore considered to fail to comply with Policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the Core strategy 2011 and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of the proposed additional massing at roof level, would result in a bulky and incongruous addition for the site at the rear which would result in overdevelopment of this constrained site to the detriment of the character of the area. The proposal is therefore considered to fail to comply with Policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011 and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
