    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, due to a combination of its height, bulk, massing and design would have a detrimental impact on the Bridges Road streetscene, as well as the character and appearance of the existing building; neighbouring buildings; and the immediate surrounding area contrary to Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014), Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy (2011) and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its position, scale, height and bulk represents an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive resulting in a harmful sense of enclosure, overlooking and obstruction of daylight and sunlight which would be materially harmful to the amenity of residential neighbouring occupiers at 266 and 270 The Broadway and 6 Bridges Road Mews. The development is therefore contrary to policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) which seeks to protect the amenity of adjacent occupiers.",
    "Reason : 3 - Due to the lack of access for all the flats to the cycle storage and refuse storage in the courtyard yard the proposal is poorly designed and would therefore fail to comply with Policies D4 and T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS14, CS17 and CS18 of the Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM T1 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed 3 storey new building would be directly opposite and relatively very close to the existing building. This would result in loss of privacy for the occupants of both buildings as views to be possible to habitable room windows. The proposed rear extension of the first and second floors of the existing building by reason of its height, scale, bulk and mass would result in overshadowing of and loss of light to the existing windows at the rear of the building. Therefore the amenity of any future occupants would be adversely affected. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.  ",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel) and DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), Policy CS20 (Parking, servicing and delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policies T6 (Car Parking) and T6.1 (Residential Parking) of the London Plan (2021)\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
