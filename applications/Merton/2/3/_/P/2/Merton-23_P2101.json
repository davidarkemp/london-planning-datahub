    "Reason : 1 - The proposed front porch by reason of its combined height, width, siting and design are considered to represent an unsympathetic form of development that would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area. Due to the provision of a large porch by virtue of its proportions, design and siting would disrupt the terrace in which it lies in and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area. Therefore, the scheme would be contrary to, in particular, Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
