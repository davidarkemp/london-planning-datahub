    "Reason : 1 - The outbuilding, by reason of its combined siting, design and excessive scale would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to reflect the form and proportion of a typical outbuilding for ancillary use associated with the main dwellinghouse in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding residential properties and on the openness of the adjoining Metropolitan Open Land. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Chapters 4, 12, 13 and 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), G3, G4, G7 (Trees and Woodlands) of the London Plan (2021), policies CS 14 (Design) and CS13 (Open Space, Nature Conservation, Leisure and Culture) of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments), DM D3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings), and 2014 DMO2 (Nature conservation, trees, hedges and landscape features) of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a use statement confirming the proposed granny annex outbuilding will remain an ancillary use to the host dwelling the proposal would fall outside the scope of a householder application. The scheme fails to comply with requirements set out under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and The Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2023.",
    "Reason : 3 - \nIn the absence of a use statement confirming the proposed granny annex outbuilding will remain an ancillary use to the host dwelling, the proposed development would result in intensification of residential use, unacceptable noise and disturbance to nearby occupants, and impact on free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Chapters 4, 9 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023),  London Plan 2021 D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), T3 (Transport capacity, connectivity and safeguarding), T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts), Merton Core Strategy planning policies CS14 (Design) and CS20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 (Design considerations in all developments) and DMT2 (Transport impacts of development) of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the removal of existing trees and in absence of satisfactory replacement trees and landscaping, the applicant has failed to demonstrate the proposal would conserve and enhance the natural environment on and off-site and thus will impact on the biodiversity in the Borough and visual amenity of the locality. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy G7 (Trees and Woodlands), Merton's Core Strategy 2011 Policy CS13 (Open Space, Nature Conservation, Leisure and Culture) and Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DMO2 (Nature conservation, trees, hedges and landscape features) and DMD2 (Design considerations in all developments).",

    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE \r\nHad the scheme been considered acceptable, the correct certificate B would have been required.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
