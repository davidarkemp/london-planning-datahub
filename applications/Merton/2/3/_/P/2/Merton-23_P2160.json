    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension works by reason of design, siting, scale, height, proportions and massing, represent an overly large, unduly dominant and visually intrusive form of development that fails to respect or complement the original building and the form, function and structure of surrounding buildings and locally distinctive pattern of development and would therefore also be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and to the visual amenities of the Florence Avenue streetscene, contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, LBM Core Strategy Policy CS14 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension works by reason of their size and siting are considered an unneighbourly form of development which would be visually intrusive, overly dominant and harmful to the amenity of neighbours at 6 Florence Avenue due to loss of outlook, overshadowing and a sense of enclosure contrary to the principles of policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
