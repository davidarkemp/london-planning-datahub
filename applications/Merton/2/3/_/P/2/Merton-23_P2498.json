    "Reason : 1 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason: \r\n\r\nThe proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and potentially result in unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of the adjoining occupants, in particular 45 and 49 Avenue Road. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason: \r\nThe proposed drawings show the proposed extension measuring 6.163m and the original dwellinghouse is semi-detached, not detached. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1 (g)(i) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason: \r\nThe proposed drawings and description show the proposed extension with an eaves height of 3.2m. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1(f)(i) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason: The proposed drawings show the extension to be finished externally in brick, materials not similar in appearance to those used in the construction. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.3(a) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
