    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of unsatisfactory layout and substandard size and absence of windows to the main communal spaces of the property, specifically the kitchen, would create a poor standard of internal environment for occupiers of the C4 HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to polices DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies CS 8, CS9 and CS14 within the Council's Adopted Core Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of lack of satisfactory layout/access to external amenity space to meet the likely needs of future occupiers the scheme the proposal would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers of the HMO.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
