    "Reason : 1 - The outbuilding, by reason of its combined siting and excessive scale would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to reflect the form and proportion of a typical outbuilding for ancillary use associated with the main dwellinghouse in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding and the setting, character and appearance of John Innes Conservation Area. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policy CS 14 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - By virtue of unacceptable siting and absence of information to demonstrate the works can co-exist sustainably with existing on-site tree, the proposal is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing tree to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and the setting, character and appearance of John Innes Conservation Area and thus would fail to achieve the objectives set out within, in particular, policy DM D2, DM D4 and DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014 and London Plan policies London Plan policies D3 & HC1 and the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a heritage statement, the proposal does not accord with chapter 16 of the NPPF 2023 and policy DM D4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
