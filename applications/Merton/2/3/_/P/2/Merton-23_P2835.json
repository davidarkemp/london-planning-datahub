    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions would appear unduly dominant and visually prominent from the Haslemere Avenue and Homefield Garden streetscene and would be viewed as an incongruous form of development to the dwellinghouse and surrounding area. Therefore, the scheme fails to complement the character of the original dwelling and their surroundings, and the proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
