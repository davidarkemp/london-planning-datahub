    "Condition : 6 - Flood mitigation - The development hereby approved shall implement the flood mitigation measures as submitted with the proposal titled: Flood Risk Assessment 2021-92_982. These measures shall thereafter be retained in perpetuity \r\n\r\nReason: To reduce the risk of flooding and to comply with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS16 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM F2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",

    "Condition : 9 - External Lighting - Any external lighting shall be positioned and angled to prevent any light spillage or glare beyond the site boundary.",
    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nPlanning permission is not an overarching right to build and there may be other legal matters to consider. Issues pertaining to property boundaries and right of way are a civil matter between neighbours ",
    "Condition : 11 - INFORMATIVE\r\nYou are advised to contact the Council's Highways team on 020 8545 3700 before undertaking any works within the Public Highway to obtain the necessary approvals and/or licences. Please be advised that there is a further charge for this work. If your application falls within a Controlled Parking Zone this has further costs involved and can delay the application by 6 to 12 months.\r\n",
    "Condition : 12 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIt is the responsibility of the developer to make proper provision for drainage to ground, watercourses or a suitable sewer.  In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off-site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of ground water.

Any such works or events commissioned by the developer and particularly those involving the connection of any utility to the site, shall be co-ordinated by them in liaison with the London Borough of Merton, Network Coordinator, (telephone 020 8545 3976). This must take place at least one month in advance of the works and particularly to ensure that statutory undertaker connections/supplies to the site are co-ordinated to take place wherever possible at the same time.\r\n",
    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThis planning permission contains certain conditions precedent that state 'before development commences' or 'prior to commencement of any development' (or similar). As a result these must be discharged prior to ANY development activity taking place on site. Commencement of development without having complied with these conditions will make any development unauthorised and possibly subject to enforcement action such as a Stop Notice.\r\n",
    "Condition : 15 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n\r\n"
