    "Condition : 1 - Permission Expires (Advert Consent) - This consent shall expire 5 years from the date of this decision.",
    "Condition : 2 - Owner's Permission - No advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.",
    "Condition : 3 - Hazards - No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military), obscure or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle.",
    "Condition : 4 - Clean and Tidy Condition - Any advertisement displayed, and any site used for the display of advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.",
    "Condition : 5 - Safety - Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not endanger the public.",
    "Condition : 6 - Removal if Necessary - Where an Advertisement is required under these Regulations to be removed, the site shall be left in a condition that does not endanger the public or impair visual amenity.",
    "Condition : 7 - Approved Plans - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Site Location Plan & Images; Communication Hub Brochure; Covering Letter; Hub Unit Management Planp; Annexe to Hub Unit Management Plan; Hub Unit Specification; Merton Sustainability Appendix B; Merton Reinstatement Appendix C. ",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its location and size, does not accord with the \r\nobligation to create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible which \r\npromote health and well-being and high standards of amenity for existing and \r\nfuture users. The proposal would lead to a conflict with various users of the \r\nshared pavement and cycle way and thereby cause harm to highway and \r\npedestrian safety. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies CS18 \r\n(Active Transport) and CS 20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of the Core \r\nStrategy 2011, and Policy DM D5 (Advertisements) of the Sies and Policies \r\nPlan 2014."
