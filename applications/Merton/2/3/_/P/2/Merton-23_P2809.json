    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension would extend from/beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, thereby breaching the threshold ofï¿½ Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (J) (iii) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015; therefore, planning permission is required.
