Please contact the Street Naming & Numbering Officer at the London Borough of Merton\r\n\r\nStreet Naming and Numbering (Business Improvement Division)\r\nCorporate Services\r\n7th Floor, Merton Civic Centre\r\nLondon Road\r\nMorden\r\nSM4 5DX\r\nEmail: street.naming@merton.gov.uk\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building. Further information is available at the following link: \r\nhttp://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/buildingpolicyandlegislation/current legislation/partywallact\r\n",

    "Condition : 13 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThis planning permission contains certain conditions precedent that state 'before development commences' or 'prior to commencement of any development' (or similar). As a result these must be discharged prior to ANY development activity taking place on site. Commencement of development without having complied with these conditions will make any development unauthorised and possibly subject to enforcement action such as a Stop Notice.\r\n",
    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE\r\nAlthough the Environment Agency (EA) has no comments on this planning application, the applicant may be required to apply for other consents directly from the EA.
