It is therefore concluded that the scheme would fail to comply with the principles of, in particular, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 of the London Plan 2021 and draft policies D12.1, D12.3 of Merton Draft Local Plan 2022.",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",

    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe proposal would involve the expansion of the existing MOT, vehicle repair garage and office under Use Class Sui Generis. As such, any future submission should establish the levels of existing on-site parking arrangements for the site. This would be to assess the balance between the potential gain for the applicant in terms of employment space and the potential loss to the neighbours amenity. "
