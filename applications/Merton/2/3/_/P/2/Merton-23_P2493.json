The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would create a sense of enclosure and potentially result in unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 85 Tennyson Avenue.
