    "Reason : 1 - The single storey rear extension by reason of its combined unacceptable siting and depth would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that fails to respect the character and appearance of the host dwelling to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality . The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of satisfactory evidence to demonstrate the lack of demand for the continued use of the Class E use in existing or alternative employment generating and/or community uses, the loss of commercial floor space in a sustainable location is considered to adversely impact on the vitality and viability of the local services to the community. The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM R3 and DM R4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS12 of Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The scheme, by reason of absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the increased number of occupiers, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
