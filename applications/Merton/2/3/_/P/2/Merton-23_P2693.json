    "Reason : 1 - The outbuilding by reason of its combined siting, design, width and depth results in a dominant, disproportionate and unsympathetic form of development that fails to relate to the character of the original building and the wider area contrary to, in particular, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of an arboricultural survey, arboricultural impact assessment and arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the scheme is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing off-site tree to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
