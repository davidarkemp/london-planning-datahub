Buildings should also be inspected for bird nests and bat roosts prior to demolition. All species of bat in Britain and their roosts are afforded special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside act 1981.  If bats are found, Natural England should be contacted for advice (tel: 020 7831 6922).\r\n",
