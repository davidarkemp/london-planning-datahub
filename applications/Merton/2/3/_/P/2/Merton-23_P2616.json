    "Reason : 1 - The proposed provision of x2 additional car parking spaces to the front and rear gardens to provide a total of x3 spaces to the application site would result in an overprovision of car parking contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a swept path analysis to demonstrate the rear parking space can be accommodated, it is considered the parking space would adversely impact on free movement to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety in the locality and would be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed parking space location on Stanford Road as shown on proposed plan drawings and associated vehicle access does not align with that consented by LBM Highways. The proposed front parking space by reason of its siting resulting in the loss of the off-site street tree unidentified by the Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Method Statement, results in an unsympathetic and unsustainable form of development that would adversely impact on the health and longevity of existing street tree to the detriment of the ecological benefit, natural environment and visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy G7, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS13 and Policies DMD2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement accurately assessing the development the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be air quality neutral, thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021."
