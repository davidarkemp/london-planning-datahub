    "Reason : 1 - By reason of loss of an existing family sized unit (3 bedroom), the scheme fails to comply with the requirements set out in Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension and rear dormer roof extension, by reason of their combined siting, width, height, design and appearance, results in a visually intrusive, unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to respect the form and appearance of the host dwelling, the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The development is therefore considered to be contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and absence of information on the allocation/provision of private amenity space, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the bike store, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 5 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain, contrary to, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional dwellings over and above the number of units currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nHad the scheme been considered acceptable, an updated Site Location Plan including the front garden would have been sought."
