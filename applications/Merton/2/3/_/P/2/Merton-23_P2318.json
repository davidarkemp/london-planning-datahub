    "Reason : 1 - The proposed mobile home unit, by reason of its siting and design would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that is easily visible from street view to the detriment of the visual amenity of the host property and the surrounding area in general. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, the London Plan design policies D1, D4, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, height and design would result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that would adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupant in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking, in particular, towards no. 16 Marlowe Square. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, London Plan design policies D1, D4, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014  Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
