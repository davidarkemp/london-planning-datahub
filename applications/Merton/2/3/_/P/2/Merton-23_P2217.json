    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined unacceptable design, height, width, depth, siting, bulk and massing would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, visually obtrusive, dominant and cramped form of overdevelopment of the site that fails to preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the streetscene and Mitcham Cricket Conservation Area.  This would amount to less than substantial harm to the heritage asset for which there is no outweighing public benefit. As such it would fail to comply with, in particular, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its unacceptable combined layout, height, depth, width, bulk and massing results in a visually intrusive, dominant and prominent form of overdevelopment that would also result in overlooking, loss of privacy and create an sense of enclosure and potential overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D1, DM D2 and DMD3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan policy D2, D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that new dwellings are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T4, T6 of the London Plan, policy DM T1, DM T2 and DM T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of satisfactory refuse storage provision, the scheme will adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety,  The proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy and policies T2 and T3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014,",
    "Reason : 5 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain, contrary to Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a site specific Flood Risk Assessment, the proposal has not demonstrated it would safeguard the locality from risk of flooding.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policies SI12 and SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Site and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
