    "Condition : 3 - Before the development hereby permitted begins, a short frontage agreement shall be agreed in writing with the local Highways authority and be put in place and operated in accordance with that agreement.\r\n\r\nREASON: To ensure that the development safeguards the free flow of traffic, the conditions of general safety along the neighbouring highways, the amenity of the area and to accord with the Councils car parking policy and standards; Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM T2 and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS20\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Hardstanding (Flooding) - The hardstanding hereby permitted shall be made of porous materials, or provision made to direct surface water run-off to a permeable or porous area or surface within the application site before the development hereby permitted is first occupied or brought into use.",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nAdvice regarding permeable and porous hardstandings can be found in the document 'Guidance on the Permeable Surfacing of Front Gardens' available at http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/pavingfrontgardens\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIt is Council policy for the Council's contractor to construct new vehicular accesses. The applicant should contact the Council's Highways Team on 020 8545 3829 prior to any work starting to arrange for this work to be done. If the applicant wishes to undertake this work the Council will require a deposit and the applicant will need to cover all the Council's costs (including supervision of the works).

In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off-site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of ground water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
