    "Reason : 1 - The rear roof extension by reason of its siting within the roof, design, size, scale and massing results in an unsympathetic, visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that fails to achieve a high standard of design, harmonise with the pattern of development of the locality, the character and appearance of the host property and the row of semi-detached dwellings it belongs to and the London Road streetscene. The proposal fails to accord with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The single storey rear/side extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth fails to achieve a high standard of design and results in an unsympathetic, visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that fails to harmonise with the pattern of development of the locality, the character and appearance of the host property and the row of semi-detached dwellings it belongs to and the London Road streetscene and creates a sense of enclosure, loss of light and is visually intrusive to the detriment of the amenity of 203 and 207 London Road. The proposals would be contrary London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Core Strategy Policy CS14 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
