    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of its combined siting, depth, width, design, layout and loss of spacing in rear garden is considered to represent an unsympathetic, incongruous and congested form of development that is out of character with the pattern of development to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality and the setting, character and appearance of adjoining conservation area. The proposal therefore be contrary to, in particular, the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and insufficient private amenity space the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, Policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM H1 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development, by reason of its combined height, bulk, massing and depth along the shared boundaries would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no.34 and 22 Baron Grove.  The proposal would be in conflict with, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout, siting of the smoking shelter and absence of mitigation measures, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the amenity of nearby occupants by way of noise and smell. The proposal would conflict with Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of an acoustic impact assessment, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the residential amenity of nearby occupants will be safeguarded.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policies DM D2 and DM EP2",
    "Reason : 7 - By reason of lack of cycle parking for staff, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and fails to provide a sustainable form of development.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 20, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM T2 and London Plan policies T5.",
    "Reason : 8 - The application has failed to demonstrate a net gain in biodiversity by incorporating ecologically friendly measures in the construction process, as such is contrary to, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of satisfactory soft landscaping incorporating tree planting, the proposal is considered to be to the detriment of visual amenity of the locality and biodiversity in the Borough.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM D2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
