Please be advised that there is a further charge for this work. If your application falls within a Controlled Parking Zone this has further costs involved and can delay the application by 6 to 12 months.\r\n",
    "Condition : 13 - INFORMATIVE\r\nAny works/events carried out either by, or at the behest of, the developer, whether they are located on, or affecting a prospectively maintainable highway, as defined under Section 87 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, or on or affecting the public highway, shall be co-ordinated under the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic management Act 2004 and licensed accordingly in order to secure the expeditious movement of traffic by minimising disruption to users of the highway network in Merton. Any such works or events commissioned by the developer and particularly those involving the connection of any utility to the site, shall be co-ordinated by them in liaison with the London Borough of Merton, Network Coordinator, (telephone 020 8545 3976). This must take place at least one month in advance of the works and particularly to ensure that statutory undertaker connections/supplies to the site are co-ordinated to take place wherever possible at the same time.\r\n",
    "Condition : 14 - INFORMATIVE (Party Wall Act) - The applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building.

    "Condition : 15 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The applicant/agent was provided with pre-application advice.\r\n   ii) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   iii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n   iv) The application was considered by the Planning Committee where the applicant/agent had the opportunity to speak to the committee and promote the application.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The scale, form, design, positioning and height of the proposals are considered to result in a harmful sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and be overbearing to the neighbouring amenities of Unit 5 (96 Merton High Street). As such, the proposals are therefore considered to fail to comply with policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
