    "Reason : 1 - The rear dormer roof extension (involving raising the ridge height by 50mm), by reason of its combined siting, height, design and appearance, results in a visually intrusive, unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to respect the form and appearance of the host dwelling, the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  Additionally, in absence of detailed information on the bin store and boundary treatments, the development is considered to cause harm to the character and appearance of the host site and surrounding area. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the external amenity area for future occupiers represents over-intensification and over-development of the site failing to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers of the HMO.  The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, London Plan (2021) Policy H9, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS14, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) DMH5 and DM D2 and London Borough of Merton Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) Requirements (Revised July 2021).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the bike store, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the bike store, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of satisfactory refuse and recycling facilities, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety contrary to, in particular, the London Plan (2021) Policy SI 7 and Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 17.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nYou shall be made aware that the works refused in this application do not have permission and as such an enforcement case shall be open and officers shall review next steps on formal enforcement action unless remedied\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
