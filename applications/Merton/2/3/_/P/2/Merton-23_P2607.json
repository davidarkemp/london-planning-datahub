The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, Chapter 4, 12 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policies D3 and HC1 London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011, Policies DM D2 and DMD4 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development reason of its siting and height is considered to reauslt in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that will increase the sense of enclosure to nearby occupants, in particular, no. 247 Coombe Lane and no. 14 Westcoombe Avenue. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to, in particular, Chapters 4 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS 14 Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
