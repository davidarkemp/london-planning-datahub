    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its combined siting and design would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development to the outrigger, easily visible from street view, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the host property, and the surrounding area in general. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, the London Plan design policies D1, D4, Merton Site and Policies Plan policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, design, depth and height would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create a sense of enclosure and potentially result in unacceptable overshadowing and loss of daylight/sunlight to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, to flats of nos. 45 and 49 London Road. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Merton Site and Policies Plan policies 2014 policies DM D2, DM D3. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
