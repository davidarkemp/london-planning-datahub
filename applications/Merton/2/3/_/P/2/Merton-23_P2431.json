    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its location and size, does not accord with the \r\nobligation to create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible which \r\npromote health and well-being and high standards of amenity for existing and \r\nfuture users. The proposal would lead to a conflict with various users of the \r\nshared pavement and cycle way and thereby cause harm to highway and \r\npedestrian safety. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies CS18 \r\n(Active Transport) and CS 20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of the Core \r\nStrategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
