The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed part single/part two storey rear extension by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, 4 Southway. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD2.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of layout, would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation resulting in an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers, particularly of Unit D. The proposal would also fail to provide acceptable external amenity space for all units. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the additional units and occupancy on site, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 7 - The applicant has failed to provide a soft-landscaping scheme, thereby failing to comply the objectives set out in G5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Measures, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 10 - In the absence of an arboricultural survey, arboricultural impact assessment and arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the proposal is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing on site and off-site (4 Southway) tree to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 11 - In the absence of confirmation of the retention of the existing front boundary wall, the scheme would increase visual permeability into a predominately hard surfaced forecourt which fails to positively contribute to the visual amenity of the streetscene contrary to, in particular, DMD2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
