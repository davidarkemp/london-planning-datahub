  "description": "ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY DWELLINGHOUSE WITHIN THE REAR COURTYARD OF THE SITE ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of their size, design, layout and location would result in an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation for future occupiers, by reason of poor outlook, lack of external amenity space and poor pedestrian access via a rear service road. The proposals would fail to comply with policy 3.5 and policy 7.2 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS.14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy, and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be safe from flooding, or that the development would not increase flood risk elsewhere. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMF1 and DMF2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policy CS16 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011, and 5.12 and 5.13 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
