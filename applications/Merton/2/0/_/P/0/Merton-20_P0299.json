  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would, by virtue of its height, scale and siting constitute an unneighbourly form of development that would be visually intrusive, oppressive and result in an increased sense of enclosure to the outdoor amenities of the occupiers of 19B Russell Road, contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would, by virtue of its design, height, scale and siting result in a visually intrusive form of development to the local area and streetscene, out of keeping with the host bungalow building, contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy (2011).",

    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. Officers reviewed amended plans for a reduced scale proposal, however, these were not formally put forward for determination by the applicant under the current planning applciation.  \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n\r\n"
