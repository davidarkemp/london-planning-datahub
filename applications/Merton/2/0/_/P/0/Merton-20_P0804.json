  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its layout, inadequate gross internal floor area for both flats and lack of external amenity space for the upper floor flat, would fail to provide suitable living conditions for future occupiers of both the ground floor and first floor flat. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Merton Local Development Framework Core Strategy (July 20110 policy CS14 d(a) & b(ii), London Plan policy 3.5 and table 3.3 of the London Plan Housing Standards (amended March 2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed conversion would result in the loss of a family sized unit and would fail to incorporate the re-provision of at least one family sized unit. This would be contrary to Merton Site's and Policies Plan (2014) Policy CS 14.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its design and sitting, would result in a incongruous form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling. The proposal therefore contrary to the principles of London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD1 and DMD2.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed ground floor rear extension by reason of its scale and sitting would be overbearing form when viewed from the adjoining property at 55 Morden Road and would also have an undue impact toward their daylight and sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2016) Policies 7.4 and 7.6, Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) CS14 and Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal fails to provide details to demonstrate that cycle parking would be implemented for both flats. As such, the proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016 and policy CS 18 of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) . ",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumption reductions can be achieved so as to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure that water usage in London is sustainable. The proposal would therefore be contrary to London Plan 2016 Policy 5.2 and 5.15 and policy CS 15 of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 7 - The proposal fails to provide details refuse stores and collection details. As such, the proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy CS 17 of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011)",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE 1\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
