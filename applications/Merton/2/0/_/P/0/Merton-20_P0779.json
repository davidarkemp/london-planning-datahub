  "description": "ERECTION OF PART SINGLE PART TWO STOREY REAR AND SIDE EXTENSIONS, LOFT CONVERSION (INVOLVING HIP TO GABLE ROOF EXTENSION AND REAR DORMERS) TO NUMBERS 119 & 121 EDGEHILL ROAD, TO CONVERT THE TWO DWELLINGS INTO 7 SELF-CONTAINED FLATS (2X 3B, 1X 2B, 3X 1B AND 1X STUDIO).  ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would provide a substandard environment for future occupiers, with the provision of poor quality and cramped internal flat layouts, and there would be limited access to sunlight, daylight and outlook for the external amenity area of Flat E. The proposal would be contrary to the London Plan (2016) Policy 3.5, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14, Policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), the London Housing SPG (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The size, scale and design of the proposed ground floor extension would result in a single grossly oversized addition which would be excessive in appearance toward the dwellinghouses. The extension would also result in the loss of separation and legibility of the properties as two end of terrace dwellings which would be harmful toward the character and appearance of the Edgehill Road streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2016) Policies 7.4 & 7.6, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 3 - The design and scale of the proposed first floor roof addition at number 119 Edgehill Road would exhibit an inappropriate flat crown roof design which would be unsympathetic to the original roof form, it would appear bulky and incongruous toward the main dwellinghouse and out of character within the surrounding area. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2016) Policies 7.4 & 7.6, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so at to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2016) Policy 5.2 and 5.15, and Merton Core Strategy Policy (2011) Policy CS 15. ",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development would be subject to a section 106 agreement restricting future occupiers/users from obtaining a parking permit. The lack of an agreement in this instance is not considered compliant and would raise concerns with potential increase in car use resulting in pressure toward on-street parking, congestion, road safety and local amenity. This would be contrary to Merton Site and Policies Plan (2014) Policy CS 20, and Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policies DM T2 and DM T3. ",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
