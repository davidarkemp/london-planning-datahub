    "Reason : 1 - The size, siting and design of the proposed development would represent an unneighbourly form of development that would result in a loss of light and outlook whilst appearing visually intrusive and overly dominant, thereby harming the amenity of neighbouring residents and the character and appearance of the Gorringe Park Avenue and Figges Road streetscenes contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 and 7.6, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed top floor flat by reason of its design, size and layout would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation with poor outlook that fails to meet adopted minimum external amenity space standards to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
