    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its, mass and design, particularly with respect to the roof, would result in a development that appears out of scale. The resulting building would also appear uncharacteristically tall and slender within the garden plot. The development would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the street scene at this location contrary to policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan [2014] CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy [2011] and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
