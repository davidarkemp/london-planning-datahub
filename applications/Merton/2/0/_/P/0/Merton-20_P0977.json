    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of their scale, height, massing, design and positioning, in proximity to windows to habitable rooms and outdoor amenity space at 486 Kingston Road would appear overly bulky and unduly dominant, resulting in an unneighbourly sense of enclosure to the outdoor space and a loss of light and outlook to the detriment of the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2016) policies 7.4 and 7.6, Merton's Core Strategy policy (2011) CS14 and policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
