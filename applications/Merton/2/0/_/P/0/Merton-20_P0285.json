  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application . \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing sufficient refuse and recycling facilities, and would be likely to detract from neighbour and visual amenity, contrary to policy 5.17 of the London Plan 2016 and policy CS17 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal by reason of the number of bedrooms, and associated potential occupancy, would result in an unneighbourly overdevelopment and intensification of the use of the site, resulting in a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers by reason of a lack of communal facilities and adequate security arrangements and, in conjunction with other housing with shared facilities locally would likely be harmful to the residential character and amenities of the surrounding Conservation Area by reason of the increased comings and goings and noise and activity associated with the use. The proposal is therefore in conflict with Policies DM D2, DM D4 and DM H5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policies 7.4 & 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policy CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011."
