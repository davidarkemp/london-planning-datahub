    "Reason : 2 - The cafï¿½ entrance and London Rd frontage shop front by reason of design and appearance fail to enhance the public realm through high quality urban design or to provide an active frontage with a window display with direct access from the shopping frontage and therefore has a negative impact on the appearance, character, vitality and viability of the premises and wider Mitcham Town centre contrary to policies DM D2, DM D7 and DM R4 of the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies CS2 and CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 ",
