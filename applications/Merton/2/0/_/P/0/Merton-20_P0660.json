    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its increase in height and resultant scale would result in a visually harmful effect on the streetscenes of Hillview and Cottenham Drive, character of host dwelling and character of the local area, in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its increase in height and resultant scale would result in a visually overbearing impact and overlooking impact on the outdoor amenity space of 13 Heights Close, and loss of natural light to the first floor window of 15 Heights Close and the ground floor side window of 13 Heights Close, in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011.\r\n"
