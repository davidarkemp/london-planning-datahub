  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, bulk, design, materials and form, the proposals would result in an inappropriate form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive and unsympathetic to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the subject building's pair, and the wider area. Therefore, the proposals are contrary to policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its scale, siting and design, would be overly dominant and an un-neighbourly form of development resulting in, an overbearing impact to adjacent occupants and cause a sense of enclosure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy 7.15 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
