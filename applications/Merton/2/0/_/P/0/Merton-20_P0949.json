  "description": "CHANGE OF USE FROM EXISITING RETAIL USE TO NURSERY USE. ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development has the potential to impact adversely on neighbour amenity arising from noise associated with the use of outside spaces and the applicant has failed to demonstrate how such an impact would be mitigated. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies DM D2, DM EP2 and DM C1 of the Merton Sites and Polices Plan July 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed nursery would be located on part of Transport for London's strategic highway network (a Red Route) and would not include the provision of off street parking or adequate dropping off and picking up facilities for parents. The proposal would harm highway safety and efficiency and result in parking issues both on the main road and side roads to the detriment of both highway safety and neighbour amenity at this location. The proposal is contrary to policies DM T2 and DM T3 of the Merton Sites and Polices Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n"
