Our Asset Protection team will ensure the works can be carried out without risk to the operational railway. The applicant / developer may be required to enter into an Asset Protection Agreement to get the required resource and expertise on-board to enable approval of detailed works. More information can also be obtained from our website https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/looking-after-the-railway/asset-protection-and-optimisation/. ",
    "Condition : 15 - Network Rail\r\n\r\nFuture maintenance\r\n\r\nThe applicant must ensure that any construction and subsequent maintenance can be carried out to any proposed buildings or structures without adversely affecting the safety of/or encroaching upon Network Rail�s adjacent land and air-space. Therefore, any buildings are required to be situated at least 2 metres (3m for overhead lines and third rail) from Network Rail�s boundary.\r\nThis requirement will allow for the construction and future maintenance of a building without the need to access the operational railway environment. Any less than 2m (3m for overhead lines and third rail) and there is a strong possibility that the applicant (and any future resident) will need to utilise Network Rail land and air-space to facilitate works as well as adversely impact upon Network Rail�s maintenance teams� ability to maintain our boundary fencing and boundary treatments. Access to Network Rail�s land may not always be granted and if granted may be subject to railway site safety requirements and special provisions with all associated railway costs charged to the applicant.\r\nAs mentioned above, any works within Network Rail�s land would need approval from the Network Rail Asset Protection Engineer. This request should be submitted at least 20 weeks before any works are due to commence on site and the applicant is liable for all associated costs (e.g. all possession, site safety, asset protection presence costs). However, Network Rail is not required to grant permission for any third-party access to its land.",
    "Condition : 16 - Network Rail:\r\n\r\nPlant & Materials\r\nAll operations, including the use of cranes or other mechanical plant working adjacent to Network Rail�s property, must at all times be carried out in a �fail safe� manner such that in the event of mishandling, collapse or failure, no plant or materials are capable of falling within 3.0m of the boundary with Network Rail.",
    "Condition : 17 - Network Rail:\r\n\r\nDrainage\r\n\r\nStorm/surface water must not be discharged onto Network Rail�s property or into Network Rail�s culverts or drains except by agreement with Network Rail. Suitable drainage or other works must be provided and maintained by the Developer to prevent surface water flows or run-off onto Network Rail�s property. Proper provision must be made to accept and continue drainage discharging from Network Rail�s property; full details to be submitted for approval to the Network Rail Asset Protection Engineer. Suitable foul drainage must be provided separate from Network Rail�s existing drainage. Soakaways, as a means of storm/surface water disposal must not be constructed within 20 metres of Network Rail�s boundary or at any point which could adversely affect the stability of Network Rail�s property. After the completion and occupation of the development, any new or exacerbated problems attributable to the new development shall be investigated and remedied at the applicants� expense.",
    "Condition : 18 - Scaffolding\r\nAny scaffold which is to be constructed within 10 metres of the railway boundary fence must be erected in such a manner that at no time will any poles over-sail the railway and protective netting around such scaffold must be installed. The applicant/applicant�s contractor must consider if they can undertake the works and associated scaffold/access for working at height within the footprint of their property boundary.",
    "Condition : 19 - Network Rail:\r\n\r\nPiling\r\nWhere vibro-compaction/displacement piling plant is to be used in development, details of the use of such machinery and a method statement should be submitted for the approval of the Network Rail�s Asset Protection Engineer prior to the commencement of works and the works shall only be carried out in accordance with the approved method statement.",
    "Condition : 20 - Network Rail:\r\n\r\nFencing\r\nIn view of the nature of the development, it is essential that the developer provide (at their own expense) and thereafter maintain a substantial, trespass proof fence along the development side of the existing boundary fence, to a minimum height of 1.8 metres. The 1.8m fencing should be adjacent to the railway boundary and the developer/applicant should make provision for its future maintenance and renewal without encroachment upon Network Rail land. Network Rail�s existing fencing / wall must not be removed or damaged and at no point during or post construction should the foundations of the fencing or wall or any embankment therein, be damaged, undermined or compromised in any way. Any vegetation within Network Rail�s land boundary must not be disturbed. Any fencing installed by the applicant must not prevent Network Rail from maintaining its own fencing/boundary treatment.",
    "Condition : 21 - Netowork Rail:\r\n\r\nLighting\r\n\r\nAny lighting associated with the development (including vehicle lights) must not interfere with the sighting of signalling apparatus and/or train drivers� vision on approaching trains. The location and colour of lights must not give rise to the potential for confusion with the signalling arrangements on the railway. The developers should obtain Network Rail�s Asset Protection Engineer�s approval of their detailed proposals regarding lighting.",
    "Condition : 22 - Network Rail:\r\n\r\nNoise and Vibration\r\nThe potential for any noise/vibration impacts caused by the proximity between the proposed development and any existing railway must be assessed in the context of the National Planning Policy Framework which hold relevant national guidance information. The current level of usage may be subject to change at any time without notification including increased frequency of trains, night time train running and heavy freight trains.",
    "Condition : 23 - Network Rail:\r\n\r\nVehicle Incursion\r\nWhere a proposal calls for hard standing area/parking of vehicles area near the boundary with the operational railway, Network Rail would recommend the installation of a highways approved vehicle incursion barrier or high kerbs to prevent vehicles accidentally driving or rolling onto the railway or damaging lineside fencing.",
    "Condition : 24 - Network Rail:\r\n\r\nLandscaping\r\n\r\nAny trees/shrubs to be planted adjacent to the railway boundary these shrubs should be positioned at a minimum distance greater than their predicted mature height from the boundary. Certain broad leaf deciduous species should not be planted adjacent to the railway boundary as the species will contribute to leaf fall which will have a detrimental effect on the safety and operation of the railway. Network Rail wish to be involved in the approval of any landscaping scheme adjacent to the railway. Any hedge planted adjacent to Network Rail�s boundary fencing for screening purposes should be so placed that when fully grown it does not damage the fencing or provide a means of scaling it. No hedge should prevent Network Rail from maintaining its boundary fencing. If required, Network Rail�s Asset Protection team are able to provide more details on which trees/shrubs are permitted within close proximity to the railway.",
    "Condition : 25 - Network Rail\r\n\r\nExisting Rights\r\n\r\nThe applicant must identify and comply with all existing rights on the land. Network Rail request all existing rights, covenants and easements are retained unless agreed otherwise with Network Rail.",
    "Condition : 26 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) An extended expiry was agreed with the applicant\r\n\r\n\r\n"
