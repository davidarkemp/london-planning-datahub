    "Reason : 1 - The current proposal, due to the siting, appearance and scale of the proposed equipment would be visually intrusive and detrimental to the open character of the neighbouring area. The proposal would also be considered harmful on highway grounds due to loss of the highway verge, and the amount of cabinets in this area. As such the proposal would be contrary to policies DMD1; DM O1; DM D4; DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policies CS13 and CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy 2011; and policies D1, D2, D3, D4, D8, SI 6 and T2 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
