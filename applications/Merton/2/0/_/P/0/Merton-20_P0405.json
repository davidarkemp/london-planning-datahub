  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension by reason of its height, depth and siting would result in an overly dominant and un-neighbourly form of development that would harm the amenities of no. 3 Belmont Avenue in the form of visual intrusion, loss of outlook, a sense of overbearing. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites & Policy Plan (2014) and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that that sufficient flood risk mitigation and resilient measures are incorporated, as necessary within Flood Zone 2. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to policy DMF1 of the Merton Sites & Policy Plan (2014), policies 5.12 and 5.13 of the London Plan (2016) and policy CS 16 of the Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nThe applicant is reminded that raised platforms above 0.3m in height from the natural ground level require planning permission and the existing platform is therefore liable to any enforcement action. It is advised to seek consent for the existing platform either separately or as part of any future planning application. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
