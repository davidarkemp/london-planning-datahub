LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
