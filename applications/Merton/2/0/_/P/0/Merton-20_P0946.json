    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: 11449-05 -D; 11449-03; 11449-01; Manufactures details - Bellus Single Wheelie Bin and 4 Recycling Box Storage",
    "Condition : 3 - The ground floor room labelled 'reception' within approved drawing 11449-05 Rev D, shall at no time be used as a bedroom, and shall be retained as a shared communal space for the occupants of the building.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure that all bedrooms are fit for occupation, and to ensure that their is an adequate provision of communal space for relaxation and leisure, so to comply with SPP DMD2.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until the refuse and recycling storage facilities shown on the approved plans, and as per Manufactures details - Bellus Single Wheelie Bin and 4 Recycling Box Storage, have been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",
    "Condition : 5 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable with amendments.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n \r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of the absence of windows in external walls to the main communal spaces of the property, specifically the kitchen and reception room (living room), juxtaposed with the potential number of occupants, would create a poor standard of internal environment for occupiers of the large HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to polices DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan [2014], and policies CS 8, CS9 and CS14 within the Council's Adopted Core Strategy [2011].",
