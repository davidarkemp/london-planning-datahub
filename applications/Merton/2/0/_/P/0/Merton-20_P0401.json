    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of scale, bulk and massing, would be unduly dominant and intrusive, resulting in a sense of enclosure, loss of light and outlook and as such would be harmful to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at 25 Hillcross Road. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - Furthermore the applicant has failed to provide a clear and accurate description of the proposed development. In particular, the boundary line between 27 and 29 shown on the submitted plans conflicts with the boundary line shown on the land registry title, and the location of the garage does not accurately reflect what is on site. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (1)(2)(a) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015."
