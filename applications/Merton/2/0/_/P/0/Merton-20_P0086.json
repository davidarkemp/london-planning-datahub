    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its size, sitting, design and layout would represent an uncharacteristic over development of this back land site in Mitcham Town centre that would fail to achieve a high standard of design that would complement or enhance the character of the area to the detriment of the character of the London Road streetscene, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies CS 2, CS13 and CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two-storey house by reason of its size, design, layout and siting would result in the provision of cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation failing to meet adopted minimum internal and external space standards to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of absence of arboricultural reports and tree surveys, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development can be undertaken without causing harm to the nearby Lime trees resulting in their possible loss with resultant harm to local biodiversity and visual amenity contrary to London Plan 2021 Policy G7, Policies DM D2 & DM O2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy CS 13 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing sufficient safe, secure and accessible cycle storage and refuse and recycling facilities contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS17 and CS 18 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Polices Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposed single aspect south facing development would meet the Council's sustainability policy objectives to withstand the long-term impacts of climate change, particularly the effect of rising temperatures on mechanical cooling requirements in or comply with adopted emissions reductions targets, contrary to policy CS 15 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application but no further information was forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
