    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion, by reason of the loss of the existing family sized unit and failure to re-provide at least one family sized unit, would be contrary to the requirements of Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS 14.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The development does not include a formal undertaking to ensure that the future occupiers of the development are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits of the Controlled Parking Zone and in the absence of sufficient on-site parking to serve the residential unit. The proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking which would lead to increased kerbside parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and pedestrian safety contrary to Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
