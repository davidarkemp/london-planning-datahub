    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\nOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\nWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\nAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\nThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\nThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\nThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The scale, form and design of the proposal is considered to have a detrimental impact on the character of the area and the wider streetscene and on the amenity of neighbouring properties. In addition, the proposal does not include a valid basement impact assessment. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with principles of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM D2, CS 14 of the Merton Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2011) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016).
