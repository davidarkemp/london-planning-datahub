  "description": "DEMOLITION AND ERECTION OF REAR PRAYER HALL FACING PARK AVENUE. ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, form and design, would represent an incongruous addition that would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and Park Avenue streetscene, resulting in a loss of light, outlook and increased sense of enclosure toward 201 Streatham Road and 2a Park Avenue Mews, as well as reducing the sense of security and loss of natural surveillance currently experienced into the adjacent mews access path. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to Policies 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that any change in visitors to the proposed development would not have a harmful impact on parking pressure on the surrounding streets and that there would not be an increased demand for on-street spaces to the detriment of local residents. The proposals would be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan Policy DM T2 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS20.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
