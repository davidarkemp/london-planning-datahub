  "description": "DEMOLITION OF EXISTING CONSERVATORY AND ERECTION OF A NEW SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The single storey rear extension, by reason of its design, scale, bulk and massing, would represent an unduly dominant and visually intrusive form, resulting in considerable overshadowing, loss of outlook and an increased sense of enclosure toward the rear of the adjoining property 10 Springfield Avenue. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 Policies 7.4 & 7.6, Policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
