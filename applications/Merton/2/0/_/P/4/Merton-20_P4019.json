  "description": "ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR AND SIDE EXTENSION TO GROUND FLOOR FLAT. THE ERECTION OF A BALCONY AT REAR OF FIRST FLOOR FLAT",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal due to the position, height, size and location of the balcony / terrace area relative to neighbours gardens and habitable rooms would result in overlooking and a harmful reduction of privacy, along with noise disturbance. The associated balustrade, planting bed and first floor door is also unacceptable, due to resulting appearance concerns, and the potential for these features to facilitate use of the flat roof as a terrace, causing harm to amenity. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE 1 -  Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n",
