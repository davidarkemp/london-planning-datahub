  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, comprising the proposed change of use to a worship and community centre, fails to be accompanied with sufficient details pertaining to the accessibility of its services and potential improvements or changes to the shop front. The absence of these details have the potential to be harmful to the character and appearance of the shop front failing to promote an accessible use and active street frontage to the detriment of this part of Mitcham Town centre and designated Secondary shopping frontage, adversely affecting the prospects for regeneration and the vitality and viability of the shopping area. This would be contrary to Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMR1, DMR4, DMD2 and DMD7 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) Policies CS2 and CS7.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals fail to demonstrate the potential noise impacts of the proposed change of use and its associated activities to be provided; in the absence of a noise impact assessment/ acoustic report and clarification of potential occupancy on site, the proposals would have the potential to be harmful to the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers. This would be contrary to Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMC1, DMD2, DMEP2, DMR4 and the London Plan (2021) Policies D13 and D14.   ",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a Transport statement or up-to-date Parking survey, the application fails to provide sufficient details to demonstrate the potential impact of increased vehicle movement likely to be generated by the proposed use, and that the provision of an on-site parking space in the rear yard could be accessed safely without hazard to pedestrian and highway safety. This would be contrary to Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2, DMR4, DMT2 and DMT5, Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) Policies CS18 and CS20 and the London Plan (2021) Policies T3 and T4. ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
