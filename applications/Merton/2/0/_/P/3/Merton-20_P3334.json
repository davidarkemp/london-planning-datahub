  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear outbuilding, by reason of its mass, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the dwelling, due to the disproportionate scale of the extension and the reduction of the rear amenity space, in comparison with the overall size of the site and the main dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear outbuilding, by reason of its mass, would be harmful to the residential amenity of the neighbouring dwellings, due to the outbuilding's side elevations creating a large hard surfaced area that protrudes past the height of the neighbouring fence/wall by approximately 1m for the majority of the length of the boundaries with both properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey rear outbuilding, by reason of its mass, would be harmful to the residential amenity of the host dwelling, due to the reduction of the area amenity area to approximately 6.7sqm, which is an unacceptable size for a dwelling of this size and type. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
