    "Condition : 1 - This consent, for signs 1, 2 and 3, shall expire 5 years from the date of this decision.",
    "Condition : 2 - No advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.",
    "Condition : 3 - No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to endanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military), obscure or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or hinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle.",
    "Condition : 4 - Any advertisement displayed, and any site used for the display of advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.",
    "Condition : 5 - Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not endanger the public.",
    "Condition : 6 - There should be no special effects (including noise, smell, smoke, animation, exposed cold cathode tubing, flashing, scrolling, three dimensional, intermittent or video elements) of any kind.\r\n\r\nReason:  In the interest of Highway safety and to comply with policy DM D5 of the Sites & Policies Plan 2014",
    "Condition : 7 - The proposed illuminated fascia signage should operate at an illumination level no greater than 300cd/m2 between dusk and dawn, consistent with the guidance set out in the Institute of Lighting Professionals (ILP) publication: \"The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements\" (PLG05, January 2015).\r\n\r\nReason:  In the interest of Highway safety and to comply with policy DM D5 of the Sites & Policies Plan 2014",
    "Condition : 8 - The projecting sign shall not be erected unless or until an oversail licence under s.177 of the Highways Act 1980 has been completed.",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed sign 4, due to its siting and internal illuminated design is considered unacceptable as it would create unnecessary visual clutter, resulting in harm to the overall character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policy 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS 7 and CS 14 of the Core Strategy, and policy DMD5 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
