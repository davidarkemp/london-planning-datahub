  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that 2 of the 3 dwellings are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally, and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. It would also prevent the Council recouping money spent to modify the Traffic Management Order. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, policy DM T1, DM T2 and DM T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that 2 of the 3 dwellings are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally, and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport.
