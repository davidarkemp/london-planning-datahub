  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its size, siting and design would constitute an overly intensive form of development. The proposal would appear cramped within the site, unduly prominent, and out of context with the street scene, resulting in harm to the character of the area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D1 and DM D2, Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and London Plan (2016) Policies 3.5 and 7.6.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its size, height, design and siting would result in harm to the neighbouring occupiers of 116 and 118 Streatham Road, presenting an intrusive and dominant flank elevation to the detriment of their visual amenity, enjoyment of their gardens and privacy. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and London Plan (2016) Policy 7.6.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would fail to provide a satisfactory outdoor amenity space which is private, of practical use and suitably screened from the public pathway. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to Merton SPP policy DM D2, London Plan (2016) Policy 3.5 and the London Housing SPG (2016). ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so at to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2016) Policies 5.2 and 5.15, and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 15.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
