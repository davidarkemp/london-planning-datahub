  "description": "ERECTION OF A GROUND FLOOR REAR EXTENSION, FIRST FLOOR PART REAR PART SIDE WRAPAROUND EXTENSION, SINGLE STOREY FRONT PORCH AND EXTENSION OF EXISITNG REAR DORMER OVER PROPOSED SIDE ADDITION. ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its design, scale, form and massing would constitute an unduly dominant and bulky addition that would dominate the rear roof form to a degree that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, out of keeping with the surrounding area and visually prominent when viewed from the neighbouring properties. The proposal would be contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
