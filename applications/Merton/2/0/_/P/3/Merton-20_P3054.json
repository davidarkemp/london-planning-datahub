  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its siting, scale, height and design would result in an overdevelopment of the site and be out of keeping with the streetscene and wider locality, and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Merton (John Innes Wilton Crescent) Conservation Area, in conflict with Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM D2 and DM D4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its siting, scale, height and outlook is considered to result in a materially harmful loss of outlook, light and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring residents at No.42 Wilton Crescent and result in a detrimental loss of privacy and loss of light to the rear amenity spaces of Nos.35 and 37 Fairlawn Road, in conflict with Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of its large overhang and level of outdoor amenity space resulting, is considered to result in a poor standard of accommodation for future occupants, in conflict with Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.  \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n\r\n"
