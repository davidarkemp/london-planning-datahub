    "Condition : 19 - Informative' Thames Water requests that the Applicant should incorporate within their proposal, protection to the property by installing a positive pumped device (or equivalent reflecting technological advances) to avoid the risk of backflow at a later date, on the assumption that the sewerage network may surcharge to ground level during storm conditions. Fitting only a non-return valve could result in flooding to the property should there be prolonged surcharge in the public sewer. If as part of the basement development there is a proposal to discharge ground water to the public network, this would require a Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water. Any discharge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. We would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures he will undertake to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquiries should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 02035779483 or by emailing wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk. Application forms should be completed on line via www.thameswater.co.uk/wastewaterquality",
