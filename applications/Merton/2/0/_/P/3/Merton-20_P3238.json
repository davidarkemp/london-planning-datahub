  "description": "APPLICATION FOR A LAWFUL DEVELOPMENT CERTIFICATE IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A FIRST FLOOR REAR EXTENSION ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension would join to the single-storey extension approved under LBM Ref: 20/P1162 which maintains an eaves height of 3.25m and would adjoin to the rear box dormer window under LBM Ref: 20/P1162 which has an eaves height well beyond 3.0 m, and is within 2m of the site boundary shared with 80 Kenilworth Road; the proposal therefore does not comply with criteria A.1 (i) and does not constitute permitted development under Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (as amended).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension would join to the single-storey extension approved under LBM Ref: 20/P1162 which maintains a total depth of 3.5m; the proposal therefore does not comply with criteria A.1 (h) and does not constitute permitted development under Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (as amended).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed extension would be finished in metal cladding which is not considered to provide a similar visual appearance to the walls of the existing dwellinghouse or those of the single-storey extension approved under LBM Ref: 20/P1162 which it is joined to; the proposal therefore does not comply with criteria A.3 (a) and does not constitute permitted development under Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (as amended).  ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed extension does not employ a roof pitch that is the same as the original dwellinghouse; the proposal therefore does not comply with criteria A.3 (c) and does not constitute permitted development under Class A of Schedule 2, Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (as amended).  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
