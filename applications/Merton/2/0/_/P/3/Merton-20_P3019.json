    "Reason : 2 - The proposed window in the gable end would have an unacceptable impact on the design and appearance of the host building, whilst failing to preserve the character and appearance of the Merton (Wimbledon Village) Conservation Area, contrary to policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy (2011).\r\n",
