  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The outbuilding, by reason of its excessive scale, design and siting, would be out of character with its surroundings, resulting in an unduly dominant form which would be visually intrusive to neighbouring occupiers and would harm the character and appearance of the surrounding Conservation Area, contrary to policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) policy CS 14 of the London Borough of Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
