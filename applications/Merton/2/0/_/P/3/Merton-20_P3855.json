    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials used in the development hereby permitted shall match those of the existing building in materials, style, colour, texture and, in the case of brickwork, bonding, coursing and pointing.",
    "Condition : 4 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.

    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nYou are advised to contact the Council's Highways team on 020 8545 3700 before undertaking any works within the Public Highway to obtain the necessary approvals and/or licences. Please be advised that there is a further charge for this work. If your application falls within a Controlled Parking Zone this has further costs involved and can delay the application by 6 to 12 months.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof dormer extension, by reason of its design, form, bulk, appearance and resulting roof profile would constitute an obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would harm the character and appearance of the locally listed building, along with the visual amenity of the wider area. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Sites and Policies Plan 2011 policy DMD1, DMD2, DMD3 and DMD4, Core Strategy 2014 policy CS 14 and London Plan 2016 policy 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8",
