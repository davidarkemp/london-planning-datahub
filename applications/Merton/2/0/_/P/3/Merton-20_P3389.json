  "description": "APPLICATION FOR PRIOR APPROVAL IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION WITH THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS: EXTENDS BEYOND THE REAR WALL OF THE ORIGINAL DWELLINGHOUSE BY 6 METRES. THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3 METRES. THE HEIGHT OF THE EAVES OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3 METRES.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its depth, height and form, would be an unduly dominant and intrusive development, resulting in a loss of light and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers at No 16 and 20 Graham Road. The proposal would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan (2016) policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the, General Permitted Development Order, Development Plan and NPPF as submitted.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE 2\r\nRefused drawings: \r\n20/16-03; 20/16-02; Site Plan"
