  "description": "PROPOSED DEMOLITION OF THE EXISTING BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION OF A 1 x BEDROOM DWELLING.\r\n",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its size, siting and design would constitute an overly intensive form of development. The proposal would appear cramped within the site and out of context with the street scene, resulting in harm to the character of the area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to SPP Policy DM D1 and DM D2, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan 2016 policy 3.5 and 7.6.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n",
