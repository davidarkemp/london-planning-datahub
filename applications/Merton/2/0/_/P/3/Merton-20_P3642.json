  "description": "APPLICATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER PRIOR APPROVAL IS REQUIRED IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION WITH THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS:\r\nEXTENDS BEYOND THE REAR WALL OF THE ORIGINAL DWELLINGHOUSE BY 6 METRES\r\nTHE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3.30 METRES\r\nTHE HEIGHT OF THE EAVES OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 2.70 METRES",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - In accordance with criteria A.1 (ja) if any total enlargement (being the enlarged part together with any existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse to which it will be joined) exceeds or would exceed the limits set out in sub-paragraphs (e) to (j) then it does not constitute permitted development. The proposed extension is joined to the two-storey component of the extension approved under LBM Ref: MER1261/85; as such, the total enlargement would have more than a single-storey and would maintain a total depth of 6.0m. The proposal therefore does not comply with criteria A.1 (h) and does not constitute permitted development. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In accordance with criteria A.1 (ja) if the proposed extension complies with criteria A.1 (i) but is being joined to a previous enlargement which exceeds these limitations, it will not constitute permitted development. . The proposed extension is joined to the two-storey component of the extension approved under LBM Ref: MER1261/85 which maintains an eaves height of approximately 5.6m within 2.0m of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse. The proposal therefore does not comply with criteria A.1 (i) and does not constitute permitted development. "
