  "description": "ERECTION OF A FIRST FLOOR SIDE AND REAR EXTENSION, ERECTION OF REAR DORMER ROOF EXTENSION, AND INSTALLATION OF TWO ROOFLIGHTS TO FRONT ROOF SLOPE. ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof and first floor rear extensions, by reason of their combined scale, form and siting, would have a detrimental impact upon the character or appearance of the host building, semi-detached pair and surrounding Conservation Area. The proposal would be therefore contrary to policies DMD2, DMD3 and DMD4 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed roof and first floor rear extensions, by reason of their combined scale, form and siting, would be visually obtrusive and overly dominant, resulting in a loss of outlook and light, harmful to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would be therefore contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
