  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The operations, comprising the erection of a single storey outbuilding extension to the rear of the dwelling, would consist of the enlargement of a dwelling house within the meaning of Class E of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in Class E. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 2 - The building, as constructed, does not match the submitted drawings and therefore the building is unlawful, notwithstanding the issuing of a certificate for a building with a lower eaves and overall height.",
    "Condition : 3 - The existing building is built upon a raised platform, which in conjunction with the height of the exsitng building, fails to meet the requirements of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E, paragraph (e)(ii), and is therefore is not considered Permitted Development."
