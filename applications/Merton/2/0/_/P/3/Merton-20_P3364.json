    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extensions, by reason of their form, design and appearance, would result in a detrimental effect on the character and appearance of the Wandle Valley Conservation Area. The public benefits of the proposed roof extensions, to provide 16 new residential units, are not considered to outweigh the less than substantial harm caused to the significance of this designated heritage asset. Therefore, proposed development is contrary to Sections 12 and 16 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2022 and Policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
