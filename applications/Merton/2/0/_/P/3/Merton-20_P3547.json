    "Reason : 1 - The proposed 1st floor roof extension by reason of its uplift in built form and proximity to neighbouring properties would result in a loss of privacy and cause overlooking for properties in Wilton Grove and Kingswood Road. As such the proposal is considered contrary to Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014), Policy CS 14 (Design) of Merton's Core Planning Strategy (July 2011), and Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed 1st floor roof extension and single storey side extension by reason of its proximity to Silver Birch Trees (T1, T2 and T3) would impact on the root protection of these trees which could lead to their removal. As such the proposals are considered to contrary to Policies DM D4 and DM O2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), Policy CS 14 (Design) of Merton's Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policies G7 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021.
