    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: CR/06 Rev C; CR08 Rev A; CR 05 Rev B; CR 07 Rev B",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials used in the development hereby permitted shall match those of the existing building in materials, style, colour, texture and, in the case of brickwork, bonding, coursing and pointing.",
    "Condition : 4 - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no extension, enlargement or other alteration of the new dwellinghouse granted under this permission, other than that expressly authorised by this permission shall be carried out without planning permission first obtained from the Local Planning Authority.\r\n\r\nReason: The Local Planning Authority considers that further development could cause detriment to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby properties or to the character of the area and for this reason would wish to control any future Development plan policies for Merton: policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - No development shall take place until a scheme for the storage of refuse and recycling has been submitted in writing for approval to the Local Planning Authority. This shall include provision for both the retained and approved new dwelling on the site. No works which are the subject of this condition shall be carried out until the scheme has been approved, and the new dwelling shall not be occupied until the scheme has been approved and has been carried out in full. Those facilities and measures shall thereafter be retained for use at all times from the date of first occupation.",
    "Condition : 6 - No development shall commence until details of secure cycle parking facilities for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. This shall include provision for both the retained and approved new dwelling on the site. The approved facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use prior to the first occupation of the development and thereafter retained for use at all times.",
    "Condition : 7 - The new dwelling hereby approved shall be occupied until evidence has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority confirming that the development has achieved CO2 reductions of not less than a 19% improvement on Part L regulations 2013, and internal water consumption rates of no greater than 105 litres per person per day.",
    "Condition : 8 - Access to the flat roof of the development hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 9 - The vehicle parking area shown on the approved plans shall be provided before the commencement of the buildings or use hereby permitted and shall be retained for parking purposes for occupiers and users of the development and for no other purpose.\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until the rear boundary treatment shown on the plans hereby approved has been installed and shall be retained thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: To ensure a satisfactory and safe development in accordance with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policies 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D1 and D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
