  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its size, siting, design and materials would constitute an overly intensive form of development. The proposal would appear cramped within the site and out of context with the street scene, resulting in harm to the character of the area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to SPP Policy DM D1 and DM D2, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan 2016 policy 3.5 and 7.6.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to provide a good standard of living conditions for the future occupants of the dwelling, given that the bedroom would suffer from poor outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policy 3.5 and 7.6 and Merton SPP policies DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Refused Drawings:\r\n130; 140; 141; 142; 143 144; 145; 146; 147\r\n\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
