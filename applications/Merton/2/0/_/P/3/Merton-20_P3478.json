  "description": "CONVERSION OF FUNCTION ROOM WITHIN THE PUBLIC HOUSE TO CREATE TWO FLATS.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposals would result in the loss of a function room that has the ability to serve the social and recreational needs of the wider community, and has failed to demonstrate that the proposed reduction of public house floor space would not threaten the wider viability of the public house, which in conjunction with the loss of the function room would diminish the social and recreational facilities of the local area. The proposals would be contrary to the objectives of the NPPF (paragraph 92), Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS 12 and Strategic Objective 4, and Merton SPP policy DM.R5.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to provide a high standard of living accommodation for the future occupants of the dwellings, due to inadequate levels of privacy, harmful levels of noise and associated disturbance along with potential for the proposed dwellings to be exposed to smoke pollution from the pub's smoking area. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policy 3.5 and Merton SPP policies DM D2 and DM EP2.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Refused Drawings\r\n20082/113; 20082/A114; 20082/A115; 20082/A111; 20082/A112\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
