  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 -  The scale, form, design and positioning of the proposed development is considered to have an undue detrimental effect on the character and appearance of the area and host building. Therefore, the proposal does not comply with the principle policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its design, scale and appearance would result in a visually dominant and overbearing form. Furthermore, the first floor extension by virtue of its positioning and design, would have a harmful visual impact on the neighbouring occupiers\r\nat both no.143 and no.149 Boundary Road. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2016) Policies 7.4 and 7.6, Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) CS14 and Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) DMD2 and DMD3.\r",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
