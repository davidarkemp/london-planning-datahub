  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The operations would consist of the enlargement of a dwelling house within the meaning of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class A. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 2 - The operations would consist of the enlargement of a dwelling house within the meaning of Class B of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class B. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 3 - The operations would consist of any other alteration to the roof of the dwelling house within the meaning of Class C of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class C. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Condition : 4 - Informative 1 - Proposed Drawings: \r\n104 Rev B; 105 Rev B; 106 Rev B; 107 Rev B; 108 Rev B; 109 Rev B; 103 Rev B\r\n\r\nInformative 2 -\r\nThe applicant should be aware that the site may provide a useful habitat for swifts. Swifts are currently in decline in the UK and in order to encourage and improve the conservation of swifts the applicant is advised to consider the installation of a swift nesting box/bricks on the site.",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension would be more than 3m in depth from the original rear wall of the dwelling. The development would therefore not comply with the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Planning permission would therefore be required."
