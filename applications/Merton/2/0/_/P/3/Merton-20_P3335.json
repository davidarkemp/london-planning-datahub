    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined backgarden siting, height, design, bulk and mass results in an incongruous, dominant and unsympathetic form of development that fails to reflect the pattern of development in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding.  The scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of lack of adequate private amenity space for both the existing and proposed dwelling units, the proposal represents an overintensification of the site to the detriment of the amenity of future occupants.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of satisfactory provision of accessible cycle and refuse stores, the proposal fails to represent a sustainable form of development that discourages the use of private car to the detriment of highway safety.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy CS 20 of the Core Strategy 2011 and policies SI 7 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
