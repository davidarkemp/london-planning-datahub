    "Condition : 26 - INFORMATIVE: \r\nWhere the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required. Should you require further information please refer to our website: https://www.thameswater.co.uk/",
    "Condition : 27 - INFORMATIVE: \r\nAs required by Building regulations part H paragraph 2.36, Thames Water requests that the Applicant should incorporate within their proposal, protection to the property to prevent sewage flooding, by installing a positive pumped device (or equivalent reflecting the technological advances), on the assumption that the sewerage network may surcharge to ground level during storm conditions. If as part of the basement development there is a proposal to discharge ground water to the public network, this would require a Groundwater Risk Management permit from Thames Water. Any discharge made within a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. We would expect the developer to demonstrate what measures will be undertaken to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit enquires should be directed to Thames Water's Risk Management Team by telephoning 02035779483 or by mailing wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk. Application forms should be completed on line via www.thameswater.co.uk. Please refer to Wholesale, Business customers; Groundwater discharges section.",
    "Condition : 28 - INFORMATIVE: \r\nThere are public sewers crossing or close to your development. If you're planning significant work near our sewers, it's important that you minimise risk of damage.

If you're planning significant works near our mains (within 3m) we'll need to check your development doesn't reduce capacity, limit repair or maintenance activities during and after construction, or inhibit the services we provide in any other way.

    "Condition : 31 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nIf you are planning on using mains water for construction purposes, it's important you let Thames Water know before you start using it, to avoid potential fines for improper usage. More information and how to apply can be found online at thameswater.co.uk/buildingwater.",
    "Condition : 32 - INFORMATIVE: \r\nThames Water will aim to provide customers within a minimum pressure of 10m head (approx. 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where it leaves Thames Waters pipes. The developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of the proposed development.",
    "Condition : 33 - INFORMATIVE: \r\nNo skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time.
