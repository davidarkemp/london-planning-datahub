    "Reason : 1 - The proposals, by reason of the nature of the residential use and its location within a locally significant industrial area would result in the unacceptable loss industrial floor space and would introduce a sensitive use in an area where legitimate expectations of generating noise are concomitant with the successful and long-term sustainable operation of industrial uses and associated activity. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies D13, D14, E4 & E6 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM.EP2 and DM.E1 of the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy CS12 of the adopted Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed residential units by reason of their location, design and layout would result in an inappropriate environment for future occupiers within a locally significant industrial area setting where the applicant has failed to demonstrate mitigation measures to address safe access, noise, fumes, air quality and disturbance from nearby industrial premises and heavy industrial traffic. The standard of residential accommodation proposed is further diminished by the poor quality of accommodation with poorly designed layouts, cramped accommodation (some units failing to meet minimum space standards), poor outlook, limited light levels and no amenity space to the detriment of future occupiers. The proposals therefore fail to accord with policies D3, D6, D14 & SI 1 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM D2, DM EP2 & of the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies CS9 & CS14 of the adopted Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the transport impacts of the development will not have an adverse impact on safety, parking and congestion along this strategically important route and the wider industrial area contrary to policies T1, T2 & T4 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM T2 and DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014  and policies CS18 and CS20 of Mertons Core Strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n.\r\n"
