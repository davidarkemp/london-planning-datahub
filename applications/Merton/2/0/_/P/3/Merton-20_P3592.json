  "description": "CONVERSION OF DWELLINGHOUSE INTO 1X3 BED AND 1X1 BED FLATS INVOLVING THE ERECTION OF A PART SINGLE,  PART TWO STOREY REAR EXTENSION, A REAR ROOF EXTENSION AND ASSOCIATED CYCLE PARKING AND REFUSE STORAGE. ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed ground floor rear extension, by reason of its depth, height and form, would be unduly dominant and intrusive, resulting in a loss of light and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers at 50  Ascot Road. The proposal would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan (2016) policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional dwellings over and above the number of units currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1. Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe agent was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
