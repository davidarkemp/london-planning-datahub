  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Proposed Floor Plan; Location Plan",
    "Condition : 3 - Alterations to the shopfront do not form part of this permission - \r\nNotwithstanding Condition 2, the alterations to the shopfront are hereby not approved, these alterations are not authorised by this permission and shall not be carried out under this permission. \r\n\r\nReason - To preserve the appearance of the locally listed building in accordance with policies of the development plan London Plan D4 and D8, Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD1, DMD2, DMD3, DMD4 and DMD7, and Core Strategy policy CS14. \r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to operation of the extraction flue, the odour mitigation measures as set out in the submitted Extract & Ventilation Statement, shall be adopted and implemented in full in accordance with the approved details, and shall be so maintained. \r\n\r\nReason - To prevent any significant disturbance to residents of nearby properties and comply with development plan policies, in particular policy DMD2 and DM EP4 of the Sites and Polices Plan 2014.",
    "Condition : 5 - Acoustic noise report needed alongside any necessary mitigation. The extraction flue shall not be switched on until an acoustic report has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. This report shall demonstrate that noise produced by the flue would meet the Council's noise standards, and include appropriate noise mitigation where necessary. The extract flue shall be completed in accordance with the details so approved.\r\n\r\nReason - To safeguard the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DMD2 and DM EP4 of the Sites and Polices Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable with conditions in place to limit the scope of works in agreement with the applicant. \r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The changes undertaken to the building's shopfront along with further proposed alterations, fail to preserve the design and architecture of the locally listed, art-deco, building resulting in harm to the appearance of the individual building, parade and the wider local character. The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan 2016 policy 7.4 and 7.6, Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD1, DMD2, DMD3, DMD4 and DMD7, and Core Strategy policy CS14.",
    "Reason : 2 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed restaurant use would not result in amenity harm due to noise, odour and refuse. The proposal is therefore contrary to London Plan 2016 policy 3.5, Merton Sites and Polices Plan policy DM D2 and DM EP2, and Merton Core Strategy policy CS17.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Refused Drawings\r\n\r\nA1.0; A1.1; A1.2\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE 2 - Note to Applicant\r\n\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
