  "description": "APPLICATION FOR PRIOR APPROVAL IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION WITH THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS: EXTENDS BEYOND THE REAR WALL OF THE ORIGINAL DWELLINGHOUSE BY 6 METRES. THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3.79 METRES. THE HEIGHT OF THE EAVES OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 2.78 METRES.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of design, position, scale, bulk and massing represents an unneighbourly form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive resulting in a sense of enclosure and lead to a loss of light and increased overshadowing that would be materially harmful to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at 187 Westway. The proposals would therefore be contrary to London Plan (2016) policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
