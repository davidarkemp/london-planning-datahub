  "description": "CONVERSION OF EXISTING GARAGE WITH FIRST FLOOR EXTENSION AND SINGLE STOREY REAR REAR EXTENSION.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension by reason of its design, form and appearance would be out of character with and detract from the Harewood Road streetscene and would constitute an incongruous form of development detrimental to the appearance of the host dwelling. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy Policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
