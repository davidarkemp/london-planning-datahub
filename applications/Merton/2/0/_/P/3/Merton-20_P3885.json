  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension due to its design, height, siting and form would introduce an unduly large and bulky element to the rear that would stand out as both dominant and intrusive, failing to complement the appearance of the existing building and terrace. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D2 and DMD3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan 2021 policy D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor extension by reason of its height, depth, form and proximity to neighbouring rear windows, would be an overbearing and un-neighbourly form of development, to the detriment of the amenities of neighbouring properties. Therefore, the development would be contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DMD2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
