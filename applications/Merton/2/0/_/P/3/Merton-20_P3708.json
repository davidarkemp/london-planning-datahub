  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The GPDO 2015 requires that the applicant supplies an accurate plan indicating the site and showing the proposed development that allows the LPA to establish whether the development complies with the conditions and limitations of Class A. The submitted plans and elevations are inconsistent with the dimensions stated on the application form because the drawings are incorrectly scaled and the extension is also not clearly drawn within the proposed rear elevation drawing. The application cannot, therefore, be assessed on the basis of the submitted information as stated in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.4 (2)(b) & (3)(a,b) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Refused Drawings\r\nSite Plan; Block Plan; Proposed Plans; Proposed Elevations\r\n\r\nINFORMATIVE 2 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended). \r\n"
