    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its siting, scale, height and design would provide a poor standard of accommodation, cause a harmful impact on neighbouring amenity and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014), Policy CSI4 of the Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021). ",
    "Reason : 2 -  The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing sufficient safe, secure and accessible cycle storage and refuse and recycling facilities contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, policies CSI7 and CS 18 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Polices Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM TI (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011). ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\t"
