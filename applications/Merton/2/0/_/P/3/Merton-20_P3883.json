    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding by reason of its design, size and siting is considered an unneighbourly form of development which would be visually intrusive, overly dominant and harmful to the amenity of neighbours and is unsympathetic to the design, materials, scale, bulk and proportions of the surrounding buildings and character of the local area contrary to the principles of policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear roof dormer by reason of its design, size and use of inappropriate materials is considered to be a visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that fails to respect and complement the design and detailing of the original building and the wider area contrary to the principles of policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
