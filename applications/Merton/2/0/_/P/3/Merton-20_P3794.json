  "description": "GROUND AND FIRST FLOOR REAR EXTENSIONS FOR THE CREATION OF 1 x ONE BEDROOM SELF CONTAINED FLAT.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due to its design, height, siting and massing would result in an incongruous and inappropriate form of development that would be dominant and intrusive, failing to complement the appearance of the existing building and terrace. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D1, DM D2 and DMD3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan 2016 policy 3.5 and 7.6.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers due to: i) the lack of external amenity space, ii) poor levels of privacy, iii) inadequate floor areas. The proposals would fail to comply with policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016, and Table 3.3 of the London Plan Housing Standards.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development due to the position of external openings as well as the height and position of massing, would result in a loss of privacy and daylight as well as have an enclosing impact on adjacent dwellings to the detriment of neighbour's living conditions. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that new dwelling is prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, Policy DM T1, DM T2 and DM T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of any refuse collection / servicing details the application fails to demonstrate how the proposal would provide suitable waste and recycling for future occupants of the dwelling, contrary to Policy 5.17 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
