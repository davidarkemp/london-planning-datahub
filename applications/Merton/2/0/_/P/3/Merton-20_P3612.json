    "Reason : 1 - Design - The proposed development by reasons of design, siting, bulk, massing and height would fail to achieve a high standard of design, failing to respond positively to the London Road Street Scene, adversely affecting the setting of the adjacent Grade II listed building at 348 London Road and would fail to either preserve or enhance the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area, contrary to policies contrary to London Plan 2021 policy HC 1, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM D2, DM D3 & DM D4 and NPPF 2024.",
    "Reason : 2 - Structural - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not harm the structural integrity of the adjoining Grade II listed building 348 London Road, contrary to the principle aims of London Plan 2021 policy HC 1, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D4 and NPPF 2024.",
    "Reason : 3 - Community Use - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the loss of the community use would not create, or add to, a shortfall in provision for the specific community uses or that there is no viable demand for any other community uses on the site, contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 Policy DM E3 and London Plan policies GG1 and S1.",
    "Reason : 4 - Residential Accommodation - The proposed development by reason of design, siting, and layout would fail to provide a high standard of residential accommodation for future occupiers due to a combination of unconventional flat layouts with irregularly shaped rooms, restricted head height, lack of private amenity space, limited outlook, loss of privacy and poor housing mix with a high percentage of single aspect units, contrary to London Plan 2021 policies D3, D6, H10 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM D2 and DM H2.",
    "Reason : 5 - Cycle Parking - The proposed development by reason of design and layout fails to provide safe and secure cycle parking facilities that takes account of crime prevention and would fail to provide minimum cycle parking standards as set out in the London Plan, therefore failing to provide adequate facilities to support active transport, contrary to London Plan 2021 policy T5 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM T1.",
    "Reason : 6 - Car Parking - Due to the lack of a parking survey or any mitigation measures, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the level of car parking associated with the proposed development would not adversely impact on local amenity and the road network, contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM T2 ",
    "Reason : 7 - Air Quality - Due to the lack of an Air Quality Assessment report, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would be Air Quality Natural, contrary to London Plan 2021 polices D3 and SI 1. ",
    "Reason : 8 - Servicing - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that servicing of the proposed development would not result in adverse harm to highway and pedestrian safety, contrary to London Plan 2021 policies T6 and T7 \r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
