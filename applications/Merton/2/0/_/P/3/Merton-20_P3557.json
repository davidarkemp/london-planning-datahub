    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: 20-511-PR03A; 20-511-PR02A; 20-511-PR01; 20-511-EX01",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied at any time other than for purposes ancillary to the enjoyment of the dwelling known as 61 Beech Gove, Mitcham, CR4 1LL. The annexe shall not be occupied independently from 61 Beech Grove.\r\n\r\nReason:  The floorspace of the accommodation is significantly below the nationally adopted minimum standard for a self-contained dwelling and would otherwise result in cramped and unsatisfactory living accommodation were it occupied independently; to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring residents, to prevent the unauthorised introduction of an independent use and to ensure compliance with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable with a minor revision.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n"
