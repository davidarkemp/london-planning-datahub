  "description": "ERECTION OF A ROOF TERRACE",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace is considered to have an undue detrimental impact on neighbouring amenity.by reason of overlooking and close proximity.   Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with the principles of policies DM D2 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016.  \r\n\r\nIt is therefore recommended to refuse permission. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
