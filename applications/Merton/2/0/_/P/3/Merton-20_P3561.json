    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive height, bulk, massing and siting, would appear incongruous in the Garfield Road street scene contrary to Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A (New dwellinghouses on detached blocks of flats) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to comply with  Part 20 Class A, paragraph A.1 (j) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the raising of the brickwork on the second floor is an engineering operation to improve the aesthetic appearance of the building and not to strengthen the existing walls. \r\n"
