    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due to its design, height, siting and massing would result in an incongruous and inappropriate form of development that would be dominant and intrusive, failing to complement the appearance of the existing building and neighbouring buildings. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D1, DM D2 and DMD3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan policy D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fail to provide a good standard of living conditions for the future occupants of the dwelling, given that the bedroom of Flat C would suffer from poor outlook. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D6 and Merton SPP policies DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development due to the position of external openings, as well as the height, depth and siting of the first floor and loft extension, would result in a loss of privacy, block light, and create an overbearing and unneighbourly presence to the detriment of neighbour's living conditions. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE 1 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant was informed of issues arising during consideration of the application.\r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
