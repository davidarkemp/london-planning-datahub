  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be visually intrusive and result in material harm to the character and appearance of the Cambridge Road streetscene and harmful toward the setting and views into and from the Copse Hill Conservation Area, failing to preserve or enhance its surrounding historic environment. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016; and Policy CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be visually intrusive and detrimental to the open character of the area and views toward the adjacent designated Open space and Metropolitan Open Land. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D6 and DM O1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; and Policy CS 13 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the development would not adversely effect on-street parking availability with the loss of a parking bay within Controlled Parking Zone RPC. The proposal would be contrary to Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011. "
