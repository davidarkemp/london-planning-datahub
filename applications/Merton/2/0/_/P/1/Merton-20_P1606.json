    "Reason : 2 - The development would cause harm to existing highway conditions due to the increased pressure on car parking resulting from the development and in the absence of a unilateral undertaking restricting future occupants from obtaining on street parking permits, the proposal is contrary to Merton's adopted Core Planning Strategy policy CS20."
