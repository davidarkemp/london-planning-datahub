    "Reason : 1 - The proposed studio unit of accommodation falls below the floorspace thresholds as set out within the Technical Housing Space Standards and in addition, fails to provide any private, external amenity space and would therefore provide a sub-standard form of accommodation that would not comply with the policy requirement to provide high quality and functional spaces for new housing. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS 14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE 1\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n   ii) The applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome within the re-submission of an application. \r\n   iii) It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n   iv) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
