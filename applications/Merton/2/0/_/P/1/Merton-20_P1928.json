    "Condition : 1 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n   ii) The application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF.\r\n   iii) It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n   iv) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by virtue of its scale and bulk would appear incongruous with its immediate context resulting in material harm to the character and appearance of the area contrary to Core Strategy CS14 (2011) and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would cause material harm to the amenity of adjacent occupiers through unreasonable sense of enclosure and diminished outlook contrary to DMD2 and DMD3 in the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - No outdoor amenity space has been provided for any of the flats proposed and therefore the proposal would not meet the requirements of DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan  (2014) and London Housing SPG with regard to outdoor amenity space.",

    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would result in the loss of a four-bed family sized unit and there are no three bed-room units proposed to mitigate this loss contrary to Policy CS14 in the Merton Core Strategy (2011).",
