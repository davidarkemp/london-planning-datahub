  "description": "ERECTION OF A THREE BEDROOM DWELLINGHOUSE",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of residential accommodation due to the close proximity of the ground floor bedroom window to the public highway, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and policy 3.5 of the London Plan (March 2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would result in one additional residential unit, whilst the site is located in a controlled parking zone and there is no legal agreement in place for the proposed unit to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS.20 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (July 2011), and policy DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed house by virtue of its height, scale, siting and footprint, would result in an overdevelopment and loss of spaciousness of this part of the Elm Grove Industrial Estate and have a detrimental impact on the Elm Grove streetscene, contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and Policy CS14 of the Core strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
