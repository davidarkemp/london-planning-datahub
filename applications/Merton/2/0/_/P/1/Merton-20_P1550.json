    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension by reason of its depth, scale and form would have a detrimental impact toward the host dwelling and surrounding character of the area. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with the principles of Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension by reason of its depth, scale and form would have a detrimental impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers at 414 and 418 (Ground Floor and First Floor Flats) Durnsford Road. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with the principles of Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
