  "description": "ERECTION OF A THREE STOREY ROOF EXTENSION, INCLUDING A TWO STORY MANSARD, TO CREATE 5 x SELF-CONTAINED FLATS WITH ASSOCIATED REFUSE AND CYCLE STORES",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development represents an unsatisfactory piecemeal development in the town centre that would impede the site's ability along with neighbouring land to deliver optimal housing outputs. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies CS3 and CS7 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011, policy 3.4 of the London Plan 2016, policy SD6 of the emerging London Plan 2019, policy N3.3 of the Merton Draft Local Plan, and the NPPF 2019, along with guidance from the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 and the Morden Station Planning Brief SPD (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, due to the scale, proportions and design would appear overly dominant,  incongruous and visually jarring against the 'art deco' style of the building's original facade and the subject terrace. The proposal would upset the symmetry of the terrace, the setting of the locally listed Morden Underground Station, and would detract from the character of this part of  Morden Town Centre. The proposals would be contrary to policies CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011, policy DMD2 and DMD4 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, policy 7.6 of the London Plan, along with guidance from the Morden Station Planning Brief SPD 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers due to: i)the lack of external amenity spaces, and ii) poor outlook and natural light due to the small size of the windows for the proposed loft level flat. The proposals would fail to comply with policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that the proposed units are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zones, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking on the local highway network, in an area of good public transport accessibility, to the detriment of the safe and efficient functioning of the highway for both pedestrians and motorists, and would fail to fulfil the Council's objectives of reducing the number of cars in the borough and promote \"active transport\" where walking, cycling and public transport are the modes of choice when planning all journeys. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, Policy DM T1, DM T2 and DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted."
