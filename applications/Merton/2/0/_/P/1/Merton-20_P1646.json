    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear roof dormer by reason of design, siting, bulk and massing represents a  detrimental, visually intrusive and overly dominant form of development that would be at odds with the predominantly pitched roof proportions and character of dwellings in the vicinity and that would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling and locality contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 and 7.6 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 in the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nThe applicant is advised that condition 9 attached to planning permission 16/P4144 has not been discharged. A failure to discharge this condition may lead to enforcement action.\r\nNon Standard Condition (Sustainability) No part of the development hereby approved shall be occupied until evidence has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority demonstrating that the development has achieved not less than the CO2 reductions (ENE1) (a 25% reduction compared to 2010 part L regulations), and internal water usage (WAT1) (105 litres/p/day) standards equivalent to Code for Sustainable Homes level 4. Informative: Evidence requirements in respect of condition 13 are detailed in the \"Schedule of evidence required for Post Construction Stage from Ene1 & Wat1 of the Code for Sustainable Homes Technical Guide. Reason for condition: To ensure the development achieves a high standard of sustainability and makes efficient use of resources and to comply with policies 5.2 of the Adopted London Plan 2015 and CS 15 of the Adopted Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.\r\n\r\n"
