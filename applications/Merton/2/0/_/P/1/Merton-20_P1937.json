  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, height, design, materials and form, the proposals would result in an inappropriate form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and unsympathetic to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, and the wider area. Therefore, the proposals are contrary to policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extensions, by reason their scale, siting and design, are unacceptable due to the potential to cause a loss of daylight and sunlight to neighbouring occupants, to the detriment of the amenities of the neighbouring property. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE - \r\n\r\nRefused Plan Numbers : Site Location Plan; 018; 019; 020; 021; 022; 023; 024; 025; 026; 027; 028; 029 Tree Survey and Arboricultural Impact Assessment.\r\n\r\nNote to Applicant:\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
