    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey extension, by reason of its scale, form, design and positioning\r\nis considered to have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the host building, surrounding area and on the neighbouring amenity of the occupiers of No.30 Malvern Close by reason of loss of daylight, loss of sunlight, loss of outlook and overbearing form. Therefore, the proposal conflicts with policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
