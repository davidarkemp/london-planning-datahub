    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of design, position, scale, bulk and massing, would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive resulting in a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook that would be materially harmful to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers at 102 Riverside Drive. The proposals would therefore be contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
