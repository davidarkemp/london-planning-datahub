    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would result in a width greater than half the width of the main dwellinghouse. This would be contrary to Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1(j)(iii) of the GPDO 2015 (as amended). Planning permission is therefore required.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of scale, bulk and massing, would be unduly dominant and visually intrusive, resulting in considerable overshadowing, loss of outlook and overbearing form toward the rear of the neighbouring property 32 Park Avenue. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
