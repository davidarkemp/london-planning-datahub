    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of size, siting, design, including facing materials, and appearance would represent an unneighbourly form of development that would result in loss of privacy and outlook whilst appearing visually intrusive thereby harming the amenity of neighbouring residents contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of design, bulk, scale, and massing, would represent an incongruous form of over development that would i) fail to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, rhythm, scale, density, proportions, height, materials and massing of surrounding buildings and existing street patterns and ii) fail to respect the space between buildings where it contributes to the character of the area and to complement the character and appearance of the wider setting resulting in material harm to the Cavendish Road streetscene contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of officer concerns arising during consideration of the application . \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n"
