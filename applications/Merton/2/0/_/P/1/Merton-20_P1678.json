    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension would be less than 0.2 metres from the eaves of the original roof, measured along the roof slope from the outside edge of the eaves. The development would therefore not comply with the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. Planning permission would therefore be required.",
