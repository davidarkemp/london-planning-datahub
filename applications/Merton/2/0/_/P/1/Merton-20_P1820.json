  "description": "APPLICATION FOR PRIOR APPROVAL IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION WITH THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS: EXTENDS BEYOND THE REAR WALL OF THE ORIGINAL DWELLINGHOUSE BY 6 METRES. THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3 METRES. THE HEIGHT OF THE EAVES OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3 METRES.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The proposed single storey extension would, by virtue of its depth, height, siting and bulk result in an overly dominate and imposing form of development adversely affecting the amenities adjoining neighbouring properties at 9 and 13 New Close, contrary to Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n\r\nYou have the right of appeal against the Council's refusal to give prior approval. Please approach the Planning Inspectorate for the procedure and forms at https://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/appeals/planningappeals\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension, by reason of its proposed depth, height and proximity to the site boundaries, would be visually intrusive and overly dominant resulting in an unneighbourly form of development that would result in a loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook to the detriment of the amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property, No.13 New Close and a loss of daylight and outlook to the detriment of the amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property, No.9 New Close. The proposals would be contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. "
