    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its design, scale, form and appearance, would represent a bulky rear addition accompanied by an unsympathetic alteration of the roof; the extensions would be highly prominent from public view, and harmful to the character and appearance of the original dwelling and streetscene of the Robinson Road and Defoe Close junction where the terrace dwellings display a distinctive building pattern.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
