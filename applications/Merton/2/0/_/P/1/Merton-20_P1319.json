  "description": "RETENTION OF EXISTING BOUNDARY TREATMENT. ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The boundary constructed around the rear yard of 55-61 Manor Road, by reason of its height, design, siting and materials, is considered an unneighbourly form of development which is unduly prominent and visually intrusive, resulting in reduced outlook and light toward the adjoining residential occupiers along Manor Road and Manor Way. The proposal is contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 of the Merton sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE: \r\nPlanning permission needs to be sought for the change of use of the site, and for the use of the porta cabin as an office. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
