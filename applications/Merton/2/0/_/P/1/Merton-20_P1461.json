  "description": "ERECTION OF A HIP TO GABLE AND REAR ROOF EXTENSION WITH THE INSERTION OF 3 x ROOFLIGHTS TO THE FRONT ROOF SLOPE.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof extension, by reason of its design and bulk, would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the streetscene and would therefore present an incongruous development to the detriment of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy policy CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
