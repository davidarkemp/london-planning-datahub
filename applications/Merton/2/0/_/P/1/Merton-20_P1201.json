    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the new flat, detriment to the amenities of future occupiers due to the lack of external amenity space and poor standard of usable floorspace. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS 14 of the Core strategy 2011 and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension would result in a visually harmful addition to the existing dwelling and surrounding character of the area by virtue of its flat roof design and depth, contrary to Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011). ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE: For any re-submission of an application, the applicant is advised to submit a Flood Risk Assessment. ",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.  \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant was informed at Pre-Application advice that a new flat wihtin the loft space would be unacceptable.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
