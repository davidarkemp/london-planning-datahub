    "Reason : 1 - The proposed conversion to flats by reason of size, design and layout fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation in the development to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, London Plan 2016 policy 3.5, DCLG Technical Housing Standards-Nationally Described Space Standards 2015",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed external staircase by reason of design, materials, size and location would fail to respect and complement the design and detailing of the original building and character of the wider setting of the local area and would represent an unneighbourly form of development that would be noisy, overly dominant, visually intrusive and lead to a loss of privacy, materially detrimental to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers and would therefore be contrary to policies; CS14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 and 7.6 ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
