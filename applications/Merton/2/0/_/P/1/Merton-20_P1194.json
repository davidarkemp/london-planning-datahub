  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The size, scale and design of the proposed dwellinghouse would present an inappropriate backland structure which would be unduly dominant when viewed from the rear of the neighbouring properties and main dwellinghouse 33 Seddon Road; it would be considered an unneighbourly form of development within the rear garden and disruptive to the building pattern of the surrounding area. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan (2016) Policies 7.4 & 7.6, Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to provide sufficient justification as to the availability of on-street parking in the area and whether would be an adequate offer of parking in the surrounding streets which would not be inappropriately exacerbated by the increase of residential accommodation. The lack of information is not considered compliant, and would raise concerns with potential increase in pressure toward on-street parking, congestion, road safety and local amenity. This would be contrary to Merton Site and Policies Plan (2014) Policy CS 20, and Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policies DM T2 and DM T3.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so at to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2016) Policy 5.2 and 5.15, and Merton's Core Strategy Policy (2011) Policy CS 15. ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
