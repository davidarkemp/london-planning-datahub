    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the proposal's scale, design and position, the two-storey extension is considered to cause material harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, adjoining building(s), and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to the principles of the London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy Policy CS14, and Sites and Policies Plan DM D2.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\n\r\nRefused Planning Drawings: \r\n7980/014 Rev N; 7980/015 Rev N; 7980/016 Rev N; 7980/017 Rev N; 7980/018 Rev N; 7980/021 Rev N; 7980/020 Rev N; Site Location Plan\r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
