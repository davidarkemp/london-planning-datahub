  "description": "ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY EXTENSION TO THE FRONT OF THE EXISTING SIDE EXTENSION",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey extension works, by reason of size, siting and design would fail to respect the appearance, materials, scale, bulk, proportions and character of the original building and its surroundings resulting in a loss of openness and an overbearing relationship with the street scene that would constitute an obtrusive and incongruous form of development that would be out of keeping with, and detrimental to, the visual amenity and character of the St. Helier Estate as a whole. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 and 7.6, Core Strategy policy CS14, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3 and the St Helier Estate Design Guide.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
