  "description": "ERECTION OF PART SINGLE PART TWO STOREY REAR AND SIDE EXTENSIONS, LOFT CONVERSION (INVOLVING HIP TO GABLE ROOF EXTENSION AND REAR DORMERS) TO NUMBERS 119 & 121 EDGEHILL ROAD, TO CONVERT THE TWO DWELLINGS INTO 7 SELF-CONTAINED FLATS (2 x 3B, 1 x 2B, 3 x 1 BED AND 1 x STUDIO).  ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would provide a substandard environment for future occupiers, with the provision of poor quality and cramped internal flat layouts resulting from an inappropriate over-intensification of the site. The proposal would be contrary to the London Plan (2016) Policy 3.5, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14, Policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), the London Housing SPG (2016).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so at to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2016) Policy 5.2 and 5.15, and Merton Core Strategy Policy (2011) Policy CS 15. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would be subject to a section 106 agreement restricting future occupiers/users from obtaining a parking permit. The lack of an agreement in this instance is not considered compliant and would raise concerns with potential increase in car use resulting in pressure toward on-street parking, congestion, road safety and local amenity. This would be contrary to Merton Site and Policies Plan (2014) Policy CS 20, and Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policies DM T2 and DM T3. ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
