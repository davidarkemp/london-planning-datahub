  "description": "ALTERATIONS AND FIRST FLOOR EXTENSIONS TO EXISTING BUILDING TO CREATE 3 X NEW DWELLINGS. ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension, by virtue of its scale, height and design would harm the character and appearance of the surrounding area and consequently would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Wimbledon Village Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by virtue of its scale, height and design would have a harmful effect on the amenity of properties on Lingfield Road and Homefield Road and therefore fails to comply with Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM D2.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a valid sustainability statement, the proposal fails to demonstrate that policy compliant carbon dioxide reductions and water consumptions reductions can be achieved so at to make the fullest contribution to climate change mitigation and to ensure water usage in London is sustainable. The proposals would be contrary to London Plan (2016) policies 5.2 and 5.15 and Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) policy CS 15. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would not deliver an appropriate standard of accommodation for future occupants and would be contrary to the London Plan (2016) policy 3.5, Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM D2."
