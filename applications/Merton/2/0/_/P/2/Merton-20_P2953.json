    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials used in the development hereby permitted shall match those of the existing building in materials, style, colour, texture and, in the case of brickwork, bonding, coursing and pointing.",
    "Condition : 4 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE \r\nThis approval confers permission under the Town and Country Planning Acts only. It does not confer consent or approval under any other statutory enactment; including the Building Regulations. Failure to obtain all necessary consents may result in enforcement action.\r\n\r\nThe extension straddles the boundary line of the neighbouring property, 13 Monkleigh Road, and therefore the explicit permission of the neighbour is required, as planning permission does not convey an ultimate right to develop on land outside of the applicant's ownership."
