  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear and side extensions, by reason of their combined scale, form and siting, would have a detrimental impact upon the character or appearance of the host building, surrounding area and on neighbouring amenity. The proposal would be therefore contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed rear and side extensions, by reason of their combined scale, form and siting, would be visually obtrusive and overly dominant, resulting in a loss of outlook and light, harmful to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would be therefore contrary to policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016."
