  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n   ii) It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n   iii) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - Notwithstanding the presence of the existing building on site, the proposed development, by reason of its use (as a new dwelling), design and siting would introduce an inappropriate form of development on this backland site, resulting in a poor outlook for future occupants and would entail access via a poor, unsecure and unlit access way to the detriment of the safety and security of future occupiers and the ambulant disabled resulting overall in a poor quality environment for future occupiers. The proposal would be contrary to policies 7.2 and 7.3 of the London Plan (2016), and policy DM.D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
