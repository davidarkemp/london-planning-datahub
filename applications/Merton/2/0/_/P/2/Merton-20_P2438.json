The ledge shall be set at least 600mm below the soffit of the bridge and be at least 300mm in width. The ledge shall remain and maintained in place thereafter.\r\n\r\nReason: To mitigate the potential impact on otters, by providing a route for otters (a protected species) and other mammals to navigate the bridge and avoid crossing the road which could lead to road death and to comply with policy 7.19 of the London Plan, policy CS.13 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy and policy DM.O2 of the Merton sites and Policies Plan.\r\n",
    "Condition : 4 - Prior to the commencement of the development, the applicant shall submit a detailed Construction Method Statement which includes but is not limited to, maintaining flood flow conveyance during construction works, river sediment management, mitigation measures to manage higher flood flows in heavy rainfall for in and out of hours including an emergency contact. \r\n \r\nReason: To ensure that flood risk is not increased and is appropriately managed during construction works and to comply with policy 5.12 of the London Plan, policy CS.16 of the Merton Local Core Planning strategy and policy DM.F1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan.\r\n",
