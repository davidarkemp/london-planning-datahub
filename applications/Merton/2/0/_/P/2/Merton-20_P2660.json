  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would result in an incongruous and inappropriate form of development that would be unduly prominent, visually dominant and intrusive and unsympathetic to the character of the area and pattern of development in the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed parking arrangement requiring an extension of the dropped curb, would have a harmful impact on the safe and efficient operation of the highway network and footpath, and therefore fails to comply with policy CS18 and CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011, policies DM T2 and DM T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\n\r\nRefused Drawings :\r\n91WR-100; 91WR-101; 91WR-103; 91WR-104; 91WR-105; 91WR-106; 91WR-107\r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
