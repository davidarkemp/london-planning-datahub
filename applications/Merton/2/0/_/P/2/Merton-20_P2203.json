  "description": "APPLICTATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER PRIOR APPROVAL IS REQUIRED IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF AN 18 METRE HIGH TELECOM MONOPOLE",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions on this particular site, rather a site on the other side of the road.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be visually intrusive and result in material harm to the character and appearance of the adjacent Grade 2* Listed Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul and the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area, contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.
