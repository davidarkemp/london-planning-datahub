    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its rear location behind commercial premises and its small size is considered to provide an inadequate habitable space by reason of it being in conflict with minimum space standards and poor access in conflict with the existing surrounding commercial uses, and thereby creating a poor standard of accommodation. The proposal is therefore considered to fail to comply with Policies DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy D6 of the London plan 2021 and the National Minimum Space Standards 2015.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its rear position on the site would prevent rear service access for the existing ground floor commercial unit and thereby could lead to its loss as a viable commercial unit. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with Policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM R3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
