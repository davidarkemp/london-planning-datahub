    "Condition : 5 - \"For the avoidance of doubt, this permission does not confer approval for anything other than the extension to the dwelling known as 70 Glamorgan Drive. Use of 70 Glamorgan Drive for purposes other than as a Single Dwelling (Use within Class C3) or as a Small House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) (Use within Class C4) would be a breach of planning control.\r\nUse Class C4 defines a Small HMO as \"a small shared houses occupied by between three and six unrelated individuals, as their only or main residence, who share basic amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom\". Use for any other purposes would be unlawful and may be subject to enforcement action under the Town and Country Planning Acts\". \r\n\r\n",

It  is sometimes called a 'house share'. If you want to rent out your property as a house in multiple occupation in England or Wales you must contact your council to check if you need a licence.\r\nYou should contact Bhamini.Patel@Merton.gov.uk at Merton Council for further advice.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i)  The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n  "
