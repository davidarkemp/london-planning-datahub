  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be detrimental to the character of the Upper Morden Conservation Area and harmful to views toward the Locally Listed Douglas Square/Legion Court building block, failing to preserve or enhance its surrounding historic environment and assets. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016; and Policy CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
