  "description": "BASEMENT, SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION AND ALTERATION TO FRONT BOUNDARY WALL.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed basement, by reason of its scale, form, design, positioning and materials would exceed 50% of either the front, rear and side garden and extend excessively beyond the external elevations of the host building, and would therefore be excessive in size for the host site and locally listed building, causing harm to the setting of the locally listed building, its character and the Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposals fails to comply with policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and the NPPF 2019.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front boundary treatment, by reason of its increase in height is considered to have a detrimental impact upon the character or appearance of the host building and surrounding Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposals fails to comply with policies DM D2 and DM D4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and the NPPF 2019. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, by reason of the proposed basement scale, a lack of an appropriate SuDS Drainage Scheme and Section Drawing showing the extent of the depth of the basement, has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not cause a harmful impact on drainage and flood risk for the area, contrary to Policies DM D2 and DM F2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS 16 of the Core Strategy 2011, Policy 5.13 of the London Plan 2016 and the NPPF 2019.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
