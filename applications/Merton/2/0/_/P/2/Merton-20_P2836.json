  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n   ii) The applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n   iii) The application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n   iv) It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n   v) The applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its design, height, scale and massing would have a detrimental impact on the character of the site and surrounding Conservation Area. As such the proposal fails to comply with Policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014), CS14 of Merton's Core Strategy (2011) and Policy 7.8 of The London Plan (2016). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its design, height, scale and massing would result in a development that would have an overbearing impact, be visually intrusive and cause overshadowing to neighbouring amenity, in conflict with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy (2011).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
