    "Reason : 1 - The applicant has failed to provide a clear and accurate description of the proposed development. In particular, the height of the eaves of the development as described on the submitted application form conflicts with the submitted plans. This application therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, condition A.4 (1)(2)(a) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The dormer roof extension cannot be considered under an application to determine if prior approval is required for a proposed: Larger home extension. The development therefore does not comply with the conditions, limitations of restrictions permitted by Class A which exceeds the limits in paragraph A.1(f) but is allowed by paragraph A.1(g), Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 .",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended)\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
