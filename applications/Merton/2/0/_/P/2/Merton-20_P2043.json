  "description": "ERECTION OF A REAR ROOF EXTENSION.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of its scale, design and siting, would result in a significant and prominent feature which is not subordinate to the roof of the original property, would be out of character with the original dwelling and surrounding properties, harmful to visual amenity when viewed from neighbouring properties and Daniel Close to the rear and would appear unduly intrusive and overly dominant to the detriment of neighbour amenity. The proposed development is therefore contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF.\r\n"
