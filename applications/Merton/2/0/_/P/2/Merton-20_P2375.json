    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the scale, form, design, positioning and materials of the proposed solar panels, the proposed development would have a detrimental impact upon the appearance of the application property and would adversely affect the character and appearance of the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposal would conflict with polices DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Merton Sites, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Polices Plan July 2014 and D1, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n"
