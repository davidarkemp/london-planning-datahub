  "description": "APPLICATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER PRIOR APPROVAL IS REQUIRED IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION WITH THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS:\r\nEXTENDS BEYOND THE REAR WALL OF THE ORIGINAL DWLELINGHOUSE BY 6 METRES\r\nTHE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3.5 METRES\r\nTHE HEIGHT OF THE EAVES OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 2.5 METRES",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would result in a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. This would be contrary to Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A (j)(iii) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Planning permission would be required.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, bulk and massing, would be unduly dominant and visually intrusive resulting in a loss of daylight and outlook, and increased sense of enclosure, toward 311 Hillcross Avenue. The proposal would be contrary to London Plan 2016 policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
