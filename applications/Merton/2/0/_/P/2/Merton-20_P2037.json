    "Reason : 1 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of location, size, layout and design would result in a structure capable of independent use that failed to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, rhythm, scale, proportions, height and massing of surrounding buildings, urban layout and landscape features of the surrounding area and which would be an  unneighbourly form of development which through its overly dominant and visually intrusive appearance would be materially harmful to the amenity of neighbouring residents contrary to polices DM D2 of the Merton sites and Policies Plan 2014, London Plan 2016 polices 7.4 and 7.6 and policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011.
