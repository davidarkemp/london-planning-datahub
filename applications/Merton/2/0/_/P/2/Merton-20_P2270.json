    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor rear extension and single storey rear extensions by reason of their design, scale and siting are considered to represent an overly dominant, overly intensive, visually intrusive and unneighbourly form of development which i) fails respect and complement the design, form, scale, bulk, massing and proportions of the original building or to complement the character and appearance of the wider setting and respect the space between buildings where it contributes to that character and ii) would have a negative impact on neighbour amenity in terms of loss of light, outlook, visual intrusion and sense of enclosure. The proposals are therefore considered contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, LBM Core Strategy Policy CS14 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (2014).   ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
