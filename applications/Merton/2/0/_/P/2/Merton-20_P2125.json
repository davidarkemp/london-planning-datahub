  "description": "REBUILDING SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION, ERECTION OF FIRST AND SECOND STOREY REAR EXTENSIONS INVOLVING ROOF EXTENSION WITH THE INSERTION OF 1X ROOFLIGHT ON FRONT ROOFSLOPE; WORKS TO ENLARGE EXISTING HMO ON THE UPPER LEVELS AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE FOR THE GROUND FLOOR COMMERCIAL UNIT.  ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor, second floor and roof extensions, by reason of their scale, bulk, massing and design would be unduly prominent resulting in incongruous additions to the host dwelling and be detrimental to the amenity of neighbouring properties and character and appearance of the host dwelling, as well as failing to preserve the character and appearance of the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation area. The proposal would be contrary to the London Plan (2016) Policies 7.4 & 7.6, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DM D2 and DM D3. ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of bedroom and shared facility sizes provided in the proposed large HMO, this would result in cramped and overcrowded rooms delivering an unsatisfactory standard of living accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. This would be contrary to the London Plan (2016) Policy 3.5, Merton Site's and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM D2 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards (nationally described space standards) (2015). ",
    "Reason : 3 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing sufficient refuse and recycling facilities, contrary to the London Plan (2016) Policy 5.17 and Merton's Core Strategy Policy CS 17. ",
    "Reason : 4 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing cycle storage facilities, contrary to the London Plan (2016) Policy 6.13, Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 18 and Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policy DM T1. ",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant:\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
