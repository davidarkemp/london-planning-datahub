  "description": "APPLICATION FOR PRIOR APPROVAL IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION WITH THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS: EXTENDS BEYOND THE REAR WALL OF THE ORIGINAL DWELLINGHOUSE BY 6 METRES. THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 3.85 METRES. THE HEIGHT OF THE EAVES OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 2.95 METRES.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The eaves height of the extension would exceed 3m in height within 2m of the site boundary and would hence not comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension by reason of its depth, scale and form would have a detrimental impact on the amenities of 56 and 60 Lower Downs Road. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with the principles of Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. "
