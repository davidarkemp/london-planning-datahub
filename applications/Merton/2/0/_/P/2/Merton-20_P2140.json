  "description": "ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY FRONT EXTENSION, CHANGE OF USE FROM B8 STORAGE TO C3 RESIDENTIAL FOR THE CREATION OF 2 x ONE BEDROOM SELF-CONTAINED FLATS.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed flats by reason of design and layout would result in poor quality and unsatisfactory accommodation that would fail to provide adequate privacy to habitable rooms, acceptable outlook from the amenity areas and would fail to meet adopted minimum external amenity space standards for the occupiers of both units to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers, contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed front extension by reason of its design, size and siting would be a form of development which would be; i) visually intrusive and overbearing, ii) fail to have regard to the pattern and grain of existing streets ensuring buildings create a positive relationship with street level activity and iii) appropriately define the public realm, respecting space between buildings  and complementing the character and appearance of the wider setting, all to the detriment of visual amenity and the open suburban nature of the Hallowell Close streetscene. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies CS13 & CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011), policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
