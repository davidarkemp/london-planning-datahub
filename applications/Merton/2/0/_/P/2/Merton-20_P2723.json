    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by virtue of its scale, height and design would harm the character and appearance of the surrounding area, and consequently would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the setting of the South Park Gardens Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by virtue of its scale, height and design would have a harmful effect on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers of 3-4 Florence Place and 29-33c South Park Road in terms of loss of outlook and therefore fails to comply with Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM D2. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).
