  "description": "PRIOR APPROVAL FOR CHANGE OF USE FROM CLASS B1(C) LIGHT INDUSTRIAL TO CLASS C3 RESIDENTIAL FOR THE CREATION OF 7 SELF CONTAINED DWELLINGHOUSES.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The developer has failed to submit a statement setting out the evidence the developer relies upon to demonstrate the building was used solely for a light industrial use on the date referred to in paragraph PA.1(b). Therefore the application does not comply with GPDO 2015 (as amended) Schedule 2, Part 3, Class PA, Condition 2- 1 (a).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a completed S.106 undertaking to ensure that the residential dwellings are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal fails to provide adequate natural light in all habitable rooms of the residential units, and therefore the proposal would not provide adequate living conditions for future occupiers. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016.  ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\n\r\nThe refused drawings are as follows:\r\n002 Rev E; 003 Rev E; 006 Rev E; 007 Rev E; 008 Rev E; 009 Rev E; 010 Rev E; 011 Rev E; 012 Rev E; 013 Rev E; 014 Rev E;  015 Rev E; 016 Rev E; 019 Rev E; 022 Rev E; 023 Rev E\r\n\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions.
