  "description": "ERECTION OF DWELLING AT REAR OF PROPERTY",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its size, sitting and design would represent an unneighbourly, overly dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would materially harm the amenity of neighbouring occupiers by reason of loss of outlook and diminishing the enjoyment of outdoor amenity space by overshadowing neighbouring gardens contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its design and siting and presence of trees on neighbouring plots, would result in cramped and unsatisfactory accommodation with a poor outlook and restricted light to habitable rooms and would fail to meet adopted minimum internal floorspace standards or provide adequate external amenity space appropriate to its proposed level of occupation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS9 & CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development by reason of its size, design and siting would be an overly dominant and visually intrusive backland development that failed to relate positively and appropriately to the siting, context, rhythm, scale, and character of surrounding buildings and prevailing street patterns of Beaulieu Close and would have the potential to impact negatively on both biodiversity and visual amenity value of neighbouring trees contrary to London Plan policies 7.4 & 7.6, Core Strategy policies CS 13 & CS14 and SPP Policies DM D2 & DM O2.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
