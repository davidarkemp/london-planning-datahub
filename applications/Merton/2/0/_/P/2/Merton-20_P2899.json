    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",

    "Condition : 3 - No development shall take place until details of particulars and samples of the materials to be used on all external faces of the development hereby permitted, including window frames and doors (notwithstanding any materials specified in the application form and/or the approved drawings), have been submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval. No works which are the subject of this condition shall be carried out until the details are approved, and the development shall be carried out in full accordance with the approved details.",
    "Condition : 4 - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 5 - No development [including demolition] pursuant to this consent shall commence until an updated Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, drafted in accordance with the recommendations and guidance set out in BS 5837:2012 has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and the approved details have been installed.  The details and measures as approved shall be retained and maintained, until the completion of all site operations.",
    "Condition : 6 - ï¿½Site supervision: The details of the Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan shall include the retention of an arboricultural expert to supervise, monitor and report to the LPA not less than monthly the status of all tree works and tree protection measures throughout the course of the construction period. At the conclusion of the construction period the arboricultural expert shall submit to the LPA a satisfactory completion statement to demonstrate compliance with the approved protection measures.",
    "Condition : 7 - No development shall take place until details of the surfacing of all those parts of the site not covered by buildings or soft landscaping, including any parking, service areas or roads, footpaths, hard and soft have been submitted in writing for approval by the Local Planning Authority. No works that are the subject of this condition shall be carried out until the details are approved, and the development shall not be occupied / the use of the development hereby approved shall not commence until the details have been approved and works to which this condition relates have been carried out in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Condition : 8 - No development shall take place until details of the front boundary are submitted in writing for approval to the Local Planning Authority. No works which are the subject of this condition shall be carried out until the details are approved, and the development shall not be occupied / the use of the development hereby approved shall not commence until the details are approved and works to which this condition relates have been carried out in accordance with the approved details. The walls and fencing shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Condition : 9 - The implementation of a vehicle crossover will be subject to a separate Vehicle Crossover Application with the Council. Applications for crossovers sited within controlled parking zones will be required to meet the criteria outlined the Vehicle Crossover Information Pack . If it is necessary to remove an existing on street parking space an amendment to the Traffic Order will be required. All fees must be paid by the applicant to cover the council's costs in advertising and consulting on the proposal and will also significantly delay the process of approving a crossover application. The council may refuse an application where it is considered that the removal of too many onstreet spaces or provision of too many crossovers would lead to insufficient on street space being available. The approval of a crossover would be subject to the outcome of a statutory consultation and therefore cannot be guaranteed. Should street furniture need to be re-located, this shall be at the expense of the applicant.",
    "Condition : 10 - No surface water runoff should discharge onto the public highway including the public footway or highway. When it is proposed to connect to a public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.   Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).",
    "Condition : 11 - No waste material, including concrete, mortar, grout, plaster, fats, oils and chemicals shall be washed down on the highway or disposed of into the highway drainage system."
