  "description": "APPLICATION FOR PRIOR APPROVAL IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION WITH THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS - EXTENDS BEYONG THE REAR WALL OF THE ORIGINAL DWELLINGHOUSE BY 6.00 THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 2.97 THE HEIGHT OF THE EAVES OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOUSE WILL BE 2.94",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The total enlargement to the dwellinghouse (being the enlarged part together with any existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse to which it will be joined), will exceed the limits set out in Class A, A.1(j), thereby failing to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1(ja) of the GPDO (2015) (as amended). ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed extension, by reason of its proposed depth, height,\r\nproximity to the boundary and orientation, would be visually intrusive and\r\noverly dominant resulting in an unneighbourly form of development that\r\nwould result in a loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook to the detriment of\r\nthe amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property, No.138 Central Road. The proposals would be contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
