    "Condition : 1 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n   ii) It is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposals, by reason of the nature of the residential use and its location within a Strategic Industrial Location would result in the unacceptable loss of the site for industrial purposes for which there is an identified need, and introduce a noise sensitive use in an area where legitimate expectations of generating noise are concomitant with the successful and long term operation of industrial uses and associated activity. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies D14, E4 & E5 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM.EP2 and DM.E1 of the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy CS12 of the adopted Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of their location, design and layout provide an unattractive, unsecure and poor quality living environment whereby occupiers are susceptible to noise and fumes from nearby industrial premises with poor quality living and amenity facilities that are not fully integrated into any residential surroundings such as to be detrimental to the amenity of occupiers. The proposals therefore fail to accord with policies D3, D13 & D14 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM D2, DM EP2, DM EP4, DM H2 & DM H5 of the adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policies CS9 & CS14 of the adopted Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposals, by reason of failing to provide any safe and secure facilities for the storage of bicycles, would fail to promote a healthy environment and more sustainable modes of transport contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS18 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
