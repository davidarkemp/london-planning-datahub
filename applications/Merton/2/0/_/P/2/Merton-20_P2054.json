    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - No development [including demolition] pursuant to this consent shall commence until an Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, drafted in accordance with the recommendations and guidance set out in BS 5837:2012 has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and the approved details have been installed.  The details and measures as approved shall be retained and maintained, until the completion of all site operations.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Site supervision: The details of the Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan shall include the retention of an arboricultural expert to supervise, monitor and report to the LPA not less than monthly the status of all tree works and tree protection measures throughout the course of the construction period. At the conclusion of the construction period the arboricultural expert shall submit to the LPA a satisfactory completion statement to demonstrate compliance with the approved protection measures.",
    "Condition : 6 - The premises shall only be used for open storage and distribution (Class B8) and vehicle hire use (Sui Generis) and for no other purpose, (including any other purpose within Class B and Sui Generis of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes Order) 1987), or in any provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification.",
    "Condition : 7 - Development shall not commence until a Delivery and Servicing Plan (the Plan) has been submitted in writing for approval to the Local Planning Authority. No occupation of the development shall be permitted until the Plan is approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and implemented in accordance with the approved plan.  The approved measures shall be maintained, in accordance with the Plan, for the duration of the use, unless the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority is obtained to any variation.",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nDemolition of buildings should avoid the bird nesting and bat roosting season. This avoids disturbing birds and bats during a critical period and will assist in preventing possible contravention of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which seeks to protect nesting birds/bats and their nests/roosts. Buildings should also be inspected for bird nests and bat roosts prior to demolition. All species of bat in Britain and their roosts are afforded special protection under the Wildlife and Countryside act 1981.  If bats are found, Natural England should be contacted for advice (tel: 020 7831 6922).\r\n",

    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nYou are advised to contact the Council's Highways team on 020 8545 3700 before undertaking any works within the Public Highway to obtain the necessary approvals and/or licences. Please be advised that there is a further charge for this work. If your application falls within a Controlled Parking Zone this has further costs involved and can delay the application by 6 to 12 months.\r\n",
    "Condition : 11 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i The application was approved without delay.\r\n\r\n"
