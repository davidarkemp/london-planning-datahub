    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would result in 7 net additional residential units with only two additional off-street car parking spaces proposed. The site is located in a controlled parking zone, and there is no legal agreement in place for the units to be 'permit free', which means the proposal would have a detrimental impact on the surrounding road network, contrary to Policies DM T1 and DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014), Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A (New dwellinghouses on detached blocks of flats) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
