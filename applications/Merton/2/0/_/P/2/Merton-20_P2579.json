    "Condition : 25 - Waste Comments\r\n\r\nWith regard to SURFACE WATER drainage, Thames Water would advise that if the developer follows\r\nthe sequential approach to the disposal of surface water we would have no objection. Where the\r\ndeveloper proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer\r\nServices will be required. Should you require further information please refer to our website.\r\nhttps://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__developers.thameswater.co.uk_Developing\u00022Da-2Dlarge-2Dsite_Apply-2Dand-2Dpay-2Dfor-2Dservices_Wastewater\u00022Dservices&d=DwIFaQ&c=HmJinpA0me9MkKQ19xEDwK7irBsCvGfF6AWwfMZqono&r=HVy2BaAHoy\r\n75Et42R7vHQVgBJr4jmCMnquJWjP\u0002jOUE&m=QpnnIxX7OTquWnI7hphCyWegTzdsFwEzybHgn93HjvE&s=DERBCPca9m9QAwH0QRYrw5fY\r\nBT9fc1sT9Ex4A-Sml9M&e=\r\n\r\nAs required by Building regulations part H paragraph 2.36, Thames Water requests that the Applicant\r\nshould incorporate within their proposal, protection to the property to prevent sewage flooding, by\r\ninstalling a positive pumped device (or equivalent reflecting technological advances), on the\r\nassumption that the sewerage network may surcharge to ground level during storm conditions. If as\r\npart of the basement development there is a proposal to discharge ground water to the public\r\nnetwork, this would require a Groundwater Risk Management Permit from Thames Water. Any\r\ndischarge made without a permit is deemed illegal and may result in prosecution under the\r\nprovisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. We would expect the developer to demonstrate what\r\nmeasures will be undertaken to minimise groundwater discharges into the public sewer. Permit\r\nenquiries should be directed to Thames Waterï¿½s Risk Management Team by telephoning\r\n02035779483 or by emailing wwqriskmanagement@thameswater.co.uk.

    "Condition : 26 - INFORMATIVE\r\nWater Comments\r\nIf you are planning on using mains water for construction purposes, itï¿½s important you let Thames\r\nWater know before you start using it, to avoid potential fines for improper usage. More information\r\nand how to apply can be found online at thameswater.co.uk/buildingwater.\r\nOn the basis of information provided, Thames Water would advise that with regard to water network\r\nand water treatment infrastructure capacity, we would not have any objection to the above planning\r\napplication. Thames Water recommends the following informative be attached to this planning\r\npermission. Thames Water will aim to provide customers with a minimum pressure of 10m head\r\n(approx 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where it leaves Thames Waters pipes.\r\nThe developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of the proposed\r\ndevelopment.",
    "Condition : 27 - INFORMATIVE:\r\n\r\nSECURE BY DESIGN\r\n\r\nThe residential communal entrance should be video access controlled SBD approved entries, tested with the appropriate locking mechanisms in situ i.e. to LPS 1175 or STS 202 or equivalent. The video access should preferably be linked to a dedicated monitor/screen within the residence. \r\n\r\nThe unit doors should be to PAS24 without a letterplate.  Mail delivery should be to a facility (individual key operated boxes) at the primary entrance point of the building within view of those using the building, preferably externally delivered and internally collected. This will mitigate the theft opportunities of post, a prevalent offence in London which often leads to identity and financial fraud offences.\r\n\r\nAny lighting should be to the required British Standards, avoiding the various forms of light pollution (vertical and horizontal glare). It should be as sustainable as possible with good uniformity. SBD asks for white light as this aids good CCTV colour rendition and gives a feeling of security to residents and visitors. ",
    "Condition : 28 - INFORMATIVE\r\n\r\nCCTV \r\n\r\nAll CCTV systems should have a simple Operational Requirement (OR) detailed to ensure that the equipment fitted meets that standard, without an OR it is hard to assess a system as being effective or proportionate as its targeted purpose has not been defined. The OR will also set out a minimum performance specification for the system. The system should be capable of generating evidential quality images day or night 24/7. For SBD CCTV systems there is a requirement that the system is operated in accordance with the best practice guidelines of the Surveillance and Data Protection Commissioners and the Human Rights Act."
