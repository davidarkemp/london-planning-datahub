  "decision_conditions": [
    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 2 - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: N/O1 A, NO/2, NO/3, N/O4, N/O5, N/O1.",
    "Condition : 3 - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - Access to the flat roof of the development hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 5 - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 6 - No development shall be occupied until details of secure cycle parking facilities for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The approved facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use prior to the first occupation of the development and thereafter retained for use at all times.",
    "Condition : 7 - No Permitted Development (Windows and Doors): Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no window, door or other opening other than those expressly authorised by this permission shall be constructed in the side elevations without planning permission first being obtained from the Local Planning Authority. \r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - No part of the development hereby approved shall be occupied until evidence has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority confirming that the development has achieved CO2 reductions of not less than a 19% improvement on Part L regulations 2013, and internal water consumption rates of no greater than 105 litres per person per day.",
    "Condition : 9 - In accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The applicant/agent was provided with pre-application advice.\r\n   ii) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   iii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n   iv) The application was considered by the Planning Committee where the applicant/agent had the opportunity to speak to the committee and promote the application.\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - Carbon emissions evidence requirements for Post Construction stage assessments must provide: \r\n\r\nDetailed documentary evidence confirming the Target Emission Rate (TER), Dwelling Emission Rate (DER)and compliance with the 19% improvement of DER over TER based on 'As Built' SAP 10 outputs (i.e. dated outputs with accredited energy assessor name; registration number, assessment status, plot number and development address); OR, where applicable: \r\n\r\nA copy of revised/final calculations as detailed in the assessment methodology based on 'As Built' SAP 10 outputs; AND \r\n\r\nConfirmation of Fabric Energy Efficiency (FEE) performance where SAP 10 section 16 allowances (i.e. CO2 emissions associated with appliances and cooking, and site-wide electricity generation technologies) have been included in the calculation.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would provide a poor standard of accommodation for both residential units by reason of a poor outlook and poor access to natural light to both bedrooms. As such the proposal fails to comply with DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS14 of Merton's Core Strategy (2011) and Policy 3.5 of The London Plan 2016.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
