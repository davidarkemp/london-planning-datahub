  "description": "SINGLE STOREY REAR/SIDE INFILL EXTENSION, FIRST FLOOR SIDE EXTENSION WITH GABLE END ROOF, ERECTION OF A REAR ROOF DORMER WITH JULIETTE BALCONY, INSERTION OF 2X OBSCURE WINDOWS ON SIDE (EASTERN) ELEVATION, CONVERSION OF GARAGE INTO HABITABLE ROOM INVOLVING ALTERATION OF DOOR INTO WINDOW AND ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR OUTBUILDING. ",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor side extension, involving roof enlargement, and enlarged dormer to the rear extended roof slope, by reason of their design, scale, form, and massing, would represent bulky additions extending the property disproportionately and resulting in an imbalance with its semi-detached neighbouring dwellinghouse. This would have a negative impact on the Coombe Lane streetscene and would be considered unduly prominent and harmful on neighbouring outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 & DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).  ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
