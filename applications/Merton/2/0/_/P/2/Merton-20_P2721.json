  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive height, bulk, massing and poor proportions, would have a detrimental impact on the appearance of the host building and the Garfield Road street scene contrary to Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy (2011), Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A (New dwellinghouses on detached blocks of flats) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its excessive height and siting, would result in an unacceptable level of overlooking of the rear gardens of Nos. 58 - 60 Milton Road and 62 - 64 Cowper Road contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A (New dwellinghouses on detached blocks of flats) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in 8 additional residential units with no off-street parking provision. The site is located in a controlled parking zone, and there is no legal agreement in place for the units to be 'permit free', which means the proposal would have a detrimental impact on the surrounding road network, contrary to Policies DM T1 and DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan (2014), Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A (New dwellinghouses on detached blocks of flats) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\n"
