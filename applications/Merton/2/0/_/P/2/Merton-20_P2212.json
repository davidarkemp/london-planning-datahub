  "description": "APPLICATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER PRIOR APPROVAL IS REQUIRED IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A 17 METRE HIGH TELECOM MONOPOLE WITH WRAPAROUND CABINET AT BASE",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, namely the furthermost cabinet, is noted to be located within close proximity to the nearby street tree causing harm to its long term stability and health, and would therefore result in a materially harmful impact to the visual appearance of the streetscene and be harmful to the character of the surrounding area. This is contrary to policies DM D1, DM D2 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n"
