  "description": "CONVERSION OF EXISTING DWELLING HOUSE TO FORM 2 X 1 BED FLATS, INCORPORATING THE ERECTION OF A NEW SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposals would result in the unacceptable loss of family sized accommodation through the provision of two small flats, the upper of which by reason of size and layout failed to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space and which failed to provide adequate outdoor amenity space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies CS 9 & CS.14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2016 policy 3.5, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical housing standards -Nationally described space standard 2015",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing sufficient safe, secure and accessible cycle storage and refuse and recycling facilities contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS17 and CS 18 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Polices Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
