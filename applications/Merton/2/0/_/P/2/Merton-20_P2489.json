  "description": "APPLICATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER PRIOR APPROVAL IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROPOSED INSTALLATION OF AN 18M MONOPOLE WITH CABINET BASE AND ASSOCIATED ANCILLARY WORKS.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be detrimental to the character of the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area and harmful to views toward the Grade II Listed Park Place building, failing to preserve or enhance its surrounding historic environment and assets. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016; and Policy CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be visually intrusive and lead to a dilution of the enhanced visual amenity to be delivered from the implementation of the planning applications for The Canons and its surrounding grounds (17/P1449 and 17/P1450), works which are supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and currently in progress. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D4 and DM D6 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; Policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016; and Policy CS 14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal, due to its siting, appearance, height and scale would be visually intrusive and detrimental to the open character of the area and key views toward surrounding designated open space and Metropolitan Open Land. The proposal would be contrary to Policies DM D1, DM D2, DM D6 and DM O1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014; and Policy CS 13 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 4 - Due to the siting and positioning of the proposed monopole and its associated equipment on the footpath, this would result in a reduction of the footpath width and obstruction to the free-flow of pedestrian movement which would cause a potentially unsafe environment for pedestrians. The proposal would be contrary to Policy DM T5 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014."
