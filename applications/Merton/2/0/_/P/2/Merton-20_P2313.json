  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of height and rearward projection in conjunction with an existing extension would be visually intrusive and overly dominant and result in a loss of outlook to the detriment of the amenities of the occupiers of 166 Kingsbridge Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
