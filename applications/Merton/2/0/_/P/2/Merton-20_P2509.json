  "description": "APPLICATION FOR PRIOR APPROVAL IN RESPECT OF THE PROPOSED ERECTION OF A SINGLE STOREY REAR EXTENSION WITH THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS 6.00M EXTENDS BEYOND THE REAR WALL OF THE ORIGINAL DWELLINGHOUSE BY 3.91M THE HEIGHT OF THE EAVES OF THE ENLARGED PART OF THE DWELLINGHOSUE WILL BE 2.36",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear extension, by reason of its depth, height and form, would be unduly dominant and intrusive, resulting in a loss of light and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers at No 83 Camborne Road. The proposal would therefore cause harm to neighbouring amenity contrary to London Plan (2016) policies 7.4 & 7.6, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) ",
