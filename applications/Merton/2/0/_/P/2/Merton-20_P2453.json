  "description": "FORMATION OF ROOF TERRACE ON REAR OUTRIGGER",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed roof terrace, by reason of its scale, form, design, siting and appearance would constitute an unduly prominent and visually intrusive addition that would detract from the character and appearance of the host building and be out of keeping with the character of the area.  In addition, the proposal would be visually intrusive and harmful to the outlook of neighbouring occupiers, the height of the balustrade allowing opportunity for overlooking, and the usage of the terrace would give rise to noise and disturbance to the detriment of the amenities of adjacent residential occupiers, representing an unneighbourly form of development. The proposal would be contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, Policy CS14 of Merton's Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission."
