    "Reason : 2 - This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED.\r\n\r\nThis is because it does not meet criteria E.1(c) of Class E Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and any subsequent legislative amendments. This is because the refuse store is sited on land forward of a wall forming the principal elevation of the original dwellinghouse.\r\n"
