    "Condition : 1 - The operations would consist of the enlargement of a dwelling house within the meaning of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development)  (England) Order 2015 \"the Order\" and would comply with the development tolerances set out in said Class A. The operation would therefore have been granted planning permission by Article 3 of the Order.",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed doors and juliet balconies which would replace windows would result overall in too much of a change and would materially affect the character and appearance of the host locally listed building in the Conservation Area. As such, the proposed works would not be permitted development and not in accordance with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Planning permission would therefore be required."
