    "Reason : 1 - The massing of the first floor extension would be excessively bulky and visually dominant harming the character and significance of the Wimbledon North Conservation Area. Accordingly, the proposal would conflict with NPPF London Plan policy HC1 and MLP policy D12.5.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would fall contrary to MLP policy D12.3 (g) in respect of neighbouring amenity by reason of unacceptable impact on outlook in respect of no. 27 Calonne Road. \r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would be excessively bulky and visually dominant when viewed in relation to the host dwelling and from no. 27 Calonne Road thereby failing to comply with to MLP policy D12.3 and D12.3 in respect of design, character and appearance. ",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
