    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to demonstrate it would comply with the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 due to measurements submitted for eaves height of the proposal exceeding the required tolerances. Planning permission would therefore be required.    ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to demonstrate it would comply with the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 due to failure to submit correct measurements in application description, and accurate drawings of the propose a site location and block plans. A resubmission with correct information application description and drawings would therefore be required. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (GPDO) 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of no. 18 Midmoor Road is assessed to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, depth, height and massing, would be unduly visually intrusive; resulting in an increased sense of enclosure toward the adjoining property no. 18 Midmoor Road. The proposal would be contrary to policies D12.1, D12.4 the Merton Local Plan (2024). "
