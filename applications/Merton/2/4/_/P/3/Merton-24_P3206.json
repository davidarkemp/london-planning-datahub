    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of design, size and layout represents an overly dominant, visually intrusive and incongruous maximisation, rather than an optimisation, of the sites capacity that would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and its wider setting and consequently the proposals are considered contrary to London Plan 2021 policy D3 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D2",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n"
