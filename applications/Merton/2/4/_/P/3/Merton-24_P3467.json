    "Reason : 1 - By reason of combined siting, height and depth, the single storey rear extension and raised patio with associated fencing results in an overbearing and visually obtrusive form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and result in overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular no.115 Kingsbridge Road. The scheme is contrary to in particular, Merton Local Plan (2024) D12.3 and D12.4",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is informed that any future resubmissi on must include a Fire Safety Strategy or Reasonabel Exemption Statement in line with London Plan Policy D12.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
