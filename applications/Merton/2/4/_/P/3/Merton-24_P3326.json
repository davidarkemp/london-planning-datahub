The proposal therefore fails to comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A, A.1(i) of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason:\r\nThe proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, form and massing, would be overbearing, unduly dominant and visually intrusive; resulting in an unacceptable loss of light, outlook and increased sense of enclosure toward the adjoining/adjacent property nos. 45 and 49 Avenue Road.
