    "Reason : 1 - This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED. This is because it does not meet criteria laid down under Class E (a) of Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and any subsequent legislative amendments. This is because the proposed development, by reason of its scale and absence of information in relation to the proposed use, has failed to demonstrate that it is reasonably required for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the main dwellinghouse."
