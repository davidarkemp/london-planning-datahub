    "Reason : 1 - The proposal  would erode the spatious green character of the site and is likely to be sited forward of the dominant building line. As such it is considered to have a detrimwental impact on the character of the site, the streetscene and the surrounding area. It therefore fails to comply with DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Polciies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals are considered likely to be overbearing, visually intrusive and result in a loss of daylight/sunlight and cause overshadowing for the adjoining site at 11 St Mary's Road. The proposal would also likely lead to harm to the standard of accommodation at 47 Leeward Gardens by any siting adjacent to the side of this dwelling. As such the proposals are considered to fail to comply with DM D2 of Merton's Site's and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a signed S106 Agreement securing the development as a custom or self-build development, the proposal has failed to comply with the Biodiversity Net Gain Legislation requirements under Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021).",

    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\nThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n"
