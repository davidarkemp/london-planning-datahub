    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding by reason of its combined siting and height results in an unsympathetic, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that adversely impacts on the setting of the host property and the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal does not comply with the principle policies D12.1, D12.3 and D12.4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024 and D3 of the London Plan 2021\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 policy SI 13 and Merton Local Plan 2024 policies F15.7 and F15.8",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
