    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dwelling by reason of its combined siting, layout and design would result in an incongruous form of development that fails to reflect the predominantly ancillary characteristic of the rear garden outbuildings in the locality. The proposal would be contrary, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Merton Local Plan 2024 Strategic Policy D12.1, Policies D12.3 and D12.4. ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the unacceptable design, layout and poor outlook from the Kitchen, Living, Dining room, the scheme would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.   Overall, the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Local Plan 2024 Strategic Policy D12.1, Policies D12.3 and D12.4.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable design and layout, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.   Overall, the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Local Plan 2024 Strategic Policy D12.1, Policies D12.3 and D12.4.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of necessary Energy Statement and the scheme failing to achieve Zero Carbon and the absence of a legal agreement to secure the required carbon offset fund the scheme fails to provide a sustainable and energy efficient scheme contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, Strategic Policy CC2.1 and Policies CC2.2, CC2.3 and CC2.4 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a water usage statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1, SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and Merton Local Plan 2024 Strategic Policy CC2.1 and Policy CC2.6.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a Fire Safety Strategy incorporating but not limited to a plan detailing appropriate positioning of fire appliances and appropriate evacuation assembly points the scheme fails to demonstrate that it would provide a safe form of development for future users contrary to, in particular, Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of sufficient evidence to confirm the development  accords with the exemption criteria claimed, the scheme fails to comply with requirements set out in, in particular, the Environment Act 2021, The Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Exemptions) Regulations 2024 and Merton Local Plan Policy O15.3.",
    "Reason : 8 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout, refuse and recycling storage facilities and intensification of use of the side passage. the scheme fails to safeguard the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, 23 Worcester Close and 25 Worcester Close in terms of noise and disturbance. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4, SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021, Strategic Policies D12.1 and W14.4, Policies D12.3, T16.3, and T16.4 of Merton Local Plan 2024. ",
    "Reason : 9 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout and restricted access to the cycle storage facilities, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of active travel and transport, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policies T5 and T6.1, London Cycling Design Standards 2016 Chapter 8.5.3 and Merton Local Plan 2024 Policy T16.1.",
    "Reason : 10 - By reason of unacceptable siting, layout and lack of adequate external lighting in particular along the rear access, the scheme fails to provide a safe and accessible form of development to the detriment of the standard of living of the future occupiers of the site. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4 of the London Plan 2021, Strategic Policies D12.1 and Policies D12.3 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 11 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
