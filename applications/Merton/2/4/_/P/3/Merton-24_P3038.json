    "Reason : 1 - The existing outbuilding by reason of its combined siting and height results in an unsympathetic, dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that adversely impacts on the appearance, form and proportion of the host property and also adversely impacts the residential amenity of nearby occupants in terms of loss of outlook and visual intrusion, in particular, the adjoining neighbours at 148 and 152 Streatham Road.  The proposal does not comply with the principle policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nThe applicant is reminded that there is an enforcement case under reference 23/E0118. If the applicant does not accord with the permission under 24/P2065  and reduces the maximum height to 2.5m then LBM Enforcement Department could issue a PCN on site."
