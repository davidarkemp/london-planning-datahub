    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the loss of existing B8 (Storage and Distribution) use within a Strategic Industrial Location, the scheme would impact on the supply of general industrial uses contrary to, in particular, London Plan (2021) Policy E5 and Merton Local Plan (2024) Policy EC13.2. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed external alterations by reason of its combined siting and design would  destroy the evident uniformity along the building frontage to the detriment of the visual amenity of the street scene.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policies D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4 of Merton Local Plan (2024).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a satisfactory Transport Assessment, details of siting of off-street parking spaces including disabled parking space/s, details of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, cycle parking spaces and details of refuse/recycling storage location, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, policies T16.3 and T16.4 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an energy assessment it has not been demonstrated the proposal would meet the necessary carbon minimisation contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI2 and Local Plan policy CC2.2,CC2.3 and CC2.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
