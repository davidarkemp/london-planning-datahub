    "Condition : 1 - Commencement of development (Full Permission) - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - Approved Plans - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: [2446_EX-001,\r\n2446_PL-301,\r\n2446_PL-302,\r\n2446_PL-303,\r\n2446_PL-304]",
    "Condition : 3 - Materials as Specified - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - No Use of Flat Roof  - Access to the flat roof of the development hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 5 - Informative - Both prior approval applications, LBM Ref 24/P2694 and 24/P3617 seek to convert the same section of the ground floor (space adjacent to the rear window). Therefore, both approvals cannot be implemented simultaneously as neither permission would be in accordance with the approved plans.  Either LBM Ref 24/P2694 and 24/P3617 would need to be implemented independently. \r\n\r\nThe applicant is reminded of planning condition 3 of LBM Ref 24/P3617 requiring confirmation of which permission is to be implemented.\r\n\r\nCondition 3 - Notwithstanding the approval of the two prior approval applications on this site in relation to the part change of use from betting shop (sui generis use) to residential (C3 use) to provide 1 x studio flat, only one application shall be implemented. Prior to the commencement of any development, the applicant must notify the local planning authority in writing of the chosen application to be implemented. No development shall commence until written confirmation of the chosen application has been received from the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nAny further changes to the ground floor layout and use may therefore need additional approvals. \r\n\r\nPlease note any breaches in planning can be subject of enforcement action.",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE (Party Wall Act) - The applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building. Further information is available at the following link: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/party-walls-building-works\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant -Approved Schemes\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\n1. Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4. Determining applications in a timely manner including providing a fast track service, details to be found on Get a quicker planning decision on LBM's website.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\ni) The application was acceptable as submitted, and approved [without delay/ with an agreed determination date].\r\n \r\n\r\n"
