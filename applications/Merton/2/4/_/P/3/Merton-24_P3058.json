    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by virtue of its height, depth, siting and design would be overbearing, visually intrusive and result in an unacceptable level of enclosure, and daylight/sunlight loss, to the detriment of occupiers of No.30 Newton Road, contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would be excessive in terms of height, bulk, and massing and would have a detrimental impact on the appearance of the original house and the terrace contrary to policies CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).   ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
