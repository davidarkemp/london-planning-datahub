    "Reason : 1 - The scheme by reason of substandard units size, unsatisfactory layout and lack of furniture details would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space which results in cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of occupiers, particularly the occupier of Flat 3. The scheme also fails to provide external amenity space for occupiers of Flats 2 and 3. The scheme is therefore contrary to, in particular, policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision for each unit and enclosures, the scheme is considered to harm the visual amenity of the host site and has the potential to impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy D3, SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021, DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 4 - The site does not have a soft-landscaping scheme and the application has failed to provide on-site biodiversity measures thereby failing to comply the objectives set out in G5 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the additional units and occupancy on site, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of loss of a family-sized unit, the scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy CS14 of Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of loss of a family-sized unit, the scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy CS14 of Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 7 - The single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in a visually intrusive, overbearing and dominant form of development that would create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants. The proposals would be contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Core Strategy Policy CS14 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",

    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance: \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nThe single storey rear addition is unauthorised and must be regularised"
