    "Reason : 1 - The proposed dormer roof extension to main roof and roof to outrigger, owing to its excessive depth, design and siting, is considered to result in a dominant and incongruous form of development to the detriment of the existing character and appearance of the host property and terrace in which it forms part of. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, polices D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of The Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
