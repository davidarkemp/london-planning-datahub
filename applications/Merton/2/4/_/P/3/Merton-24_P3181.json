    "Reason : 1 - Under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason: \r\n\r\nBy reason of substandard unit size, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site failing to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers of the scheme.  The scheme fails to meet the minimum gross internal floor area as set out by the Technical Housing Standards - nationally described space standards 2015 and fails to comply with Article 3, Paragraph 9A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason: \r\n\r\nIn the absence of sufficient on-site parking to serve the residential units and the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that new residential units are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on-street parking to the detriment of the free flow of traffic in the locality and highway and pedestrian safety and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.\r\n",
