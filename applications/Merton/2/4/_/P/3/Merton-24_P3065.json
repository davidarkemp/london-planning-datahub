    "Reason : 1 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout which results in inadequate floor to ceiling height, inadequate external amenity space and inadequate Kitchen, Living, Dining room area, the scheme would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. Overall, the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Local Plan 2024 Strategic Policy D12.1, Policies D12.3 and D12.4.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a s106 legal agreement securing the required financial contribution towards affordable housing or a financial viability assessment to justify the lack of, the scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan (2024).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of absence of necessary Energy Statement and the scheme failing to achieve Zero Carbon and the absence of a legal agreement to secure the required carbon offset fund the scheme fails to provide a sustainable and energy efficient scheme contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, Strategic Policy CC2.1 and Policies CC2.2, CC2.3 and CC2.4 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a water usage statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1, SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and Merton Local Plan 2024 Strategic Policy CC2.1 and Policy CC2.6.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of sufficient evidence to confirm the development  accords with the exemption criteria claimed, the scheme fails to comply with requirements set out in, in particular, the Environment Act 2021, The Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Exemptions) Regulations 2024 and Merton Local Plan Policy O15.3.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of sufficient evidence to confirm the development  accords with the exemption criteria claimed, the scheme fails to comply with requirements set out in, in particular, the Environment Act 2021, The Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Exemptions) Regulations 2024 and Merton Local Plan Policy O15.3.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of insufficient refuse and recycling storage facilities for the three proposed residential units. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4, SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021, Strategic Policies D12.1 and W14.4, Policies D12.3, T16.3, and T16.4 of Merton Local Plan 2024. ",
    "Reason : 7 - By reason of inadequate cycle storage, unsatisfactory layout and restricted access to the cycle storage facilities, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of active travel and transport, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policies T5 and T6.1, London Cycling Design Standards 2016 Chapter 8.5.3 and Merton Local Plan 2024 Policy T16.1.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
