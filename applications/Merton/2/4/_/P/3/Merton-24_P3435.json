  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of a family sized residential unit, thereby failing to comply with policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan 2024 ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two on-site car parking spaces due to the siting, poor accessibility and lack of swept path analysis would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy T16.1 of Merton's Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to limit the parking permit to 1 residential car parking permit within the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, T16.1, T16.3 and T16.4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of satisfactory and convenient access to cycle storage facilities, the scheme is contrary to policy T16.2 of Merton's Local Plan 2024 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of adequate refuse and recycling storage facilities for the development, and due to the refuse store doors opening over the public highway (footway), the applicant has not demonstrated that the scheme would not adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and result in material harm to the visual amenity  of the area.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4, SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021,  Merton Local Plan 2024 policy D12.2, D12.3 and W14.4.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a Biodiversity Net Gain Statement incorporating aerial images of the site, marked up to show existing development areas, and how that accords with the exemption criteria claimed, together with photographs of the current site conditions, the scheme fails to comply with requirements set out in, in particular, the Environment Act 2021, The Biodiversity Gain Requirements (Exemptions) Regulations 2024 and Merton Local Plan Policy O15.3.",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating drainage strategy, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Strategic Policy F15.7, Policy F15.8 Managing Local Flooding and Policy F15.9 Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDS) of the Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
