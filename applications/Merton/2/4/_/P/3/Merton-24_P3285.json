    "Condition : 5 - Noise Levels - Expressed as the equivalent continuous sound level) LAeq (15 minutes), from the new mechanical plant/air conditioning shall not exceed LA90-10bB at the boundary with any residential property. \r\n\r\nReason:  To safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of adjoining properties and to comply with the following Development Plan policies for Merton: policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policy CS14 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2, DM D3 & DM EP2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014\r\n",

In the event that implementation of the development \r\nimpacts users of those services such as alighting or accessing bus stops or requires the \r\ntemporary re-routeing of bus services or other such arrangements, these must be agreed with TfL \r\nbefore the work. \r\n\r\nHigh Street supports various bus routes.  All vehicles associated with the development must only \r\npark / stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions. \r\n\r\nIt is vital that construction work associated with the development is carried out in accordance with \r\nbest practice, minimising impact upon vulnerable road users including cyclists on surrounding streets. TfL strongly encourages the use of construction contractors who are registered on the Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme and adhere to the CLOCS standard. Contractor vehicles should include side-bars, blind spot mirrors and detection equipment to reduce the risk and impact of collisions with other road users and pedestrians on the capitalï¿½s roads.

Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2.
