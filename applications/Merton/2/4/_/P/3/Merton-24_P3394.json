    "Reason : 1 - The siting, scale, form and massing of the combined first and second floor extension would be overly dominant and of excessive bulk when viewed in relation to the original dwelling and in relation to the surrounding Conservation Area. Accordingly, the proposal would conflict with NPPF London Plan policy HC1 and MLP policy D12.5 due to the harm caused to the significance of the Conservation Area and Locally Listed Building. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The siting, scale, form and massing of the combined first and second floor extension would be overly dominant and of excessive bulk when viewed in relation to the original dwelling and in relation to dwellings in the locality. Therefore the proposal would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area contrary to MLP policy D12.3 and D12.3",
    "Reason : 3 - Officers consider the proposed development would fall contrary to \r\nMLP policy D12.3 (g) in respect of neighbouring amenity by reason of unacceptable impact on outlook in respect of no. 34 Denmark Road, and unacceptable impact on privacy from the proposed Juliet balcony in respect of no. 4 and 5 St John's Road. \r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\nThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\nIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n"
