The works that have been recently completed do not comply with the requirements of Conditions 2 & 3 as they do not accord with the approved drawings or materials and would not be lawful under section 171A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Therefore, the planning permission granted by virtue of LBM 13/P1704 has lapsed and there is no extant consent in place for the works that have themselves been undertaken other than in accordance with the approved plans and materials. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development was substantially complete at least 4 years prior to the submission of the application and therefore the development would not be lawful under section 171B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)."
