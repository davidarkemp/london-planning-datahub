    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer roof extension by reason of its combined siting, design and use of incongruous materials at roof level would fail to achieve a high standard of design, being out of keeping, unduly dominant and unsympathetic to the appearance and character of the original building, the terrace row that its forms a part of and the wider area contrary to, in particular, National Planning Policy Framework Chapters 4 and 12, London Plan 2021 policies D3 and D4,  Merton Local Plan 2024 policies D12.1, D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear dormer roof extension by reason of its combined siting, design and layout incorporating a terrace platform would create direct views and a platform for prolonged overlooking to the rear gardens of No. 24 and No. 28 St Olave's Walk, Streatham that would result in an unacceptable impact on the privacy, perceived overlooking to the detriment of the residential amenity and quality of life of the occupiers of those properties contrary to, in particular, National Planning Policy Framework Chapters 4 and 12, London Plan 2021 policies D3 and D4,  Merton Local Plan 2024 policies D12.1, D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4.

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
