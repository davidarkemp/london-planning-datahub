    "Reason : 1 - The proposals by reason of unsatisfactory layout and substandard size and to the main communal spaces of the property, specifically the living room, would create a poor standard of internal environment for occupiers of the Sui Generis HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to polices H11.1 and D12.3 of the Merton Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of satisfactory refuse and recycling storage facilities for the development, the proposal fails to accord with Policies SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021, and W14.4 of the Merton Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional occupiers over and above the number of units currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, and policies T16.2, T16.3 and T16.4 of the Merton Local Plan 2024",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of the lack of an energy assessment (demonstrating how the scheme will maximise carbon savings against the Mayor�s Zero Carbon target and achieve minimum onsite targets), a lack of information to demonstrate that internal water usage rates of less than 105 litres per person per day will be achieved and a lack of information relating to ventilation or overheating, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the application would meet the requirement of Policies CC2.1, CC2.2, CC2.3, CC2.4 and CC2.6.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a fire safety strategy, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would provide the highest standard of fire safety, thereby failing to comply with policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n"
