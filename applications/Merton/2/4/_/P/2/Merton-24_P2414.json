    "Reason : 1 - The general height, scale and form of the proposed dwelling would be inappropriate for the proposal's location, and the resulting bulk and mass would serve to erode the character and appearance of the host site and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its unacceptable combined layout, height, depth, width, bulk and massing results in a visually intrusive, dominant and prominent form of overdevelopment that would also result in perceived overlooking, loss of privacy and create an sense of enclosure and potential overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, particularly 19&23 Oxford Close. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D2, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan policy D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of section drawings, officers are unable to ascertain whether the proposal would have acceptable floor to ceiling heighs as outline within policy D6 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 4 - The development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to policy  DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of adequate refuse and recycling storage facilities for the development, the applicant has not demonstrated that the scheme would not adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and result in material harm to the visual amenity  of the area.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4, SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021,  Merton Core Strategy 2011 policies CS14 & CS17 and Policies DM D2, (plus highway policies) of the SPP 2014.",
    "Reason : 6 - The scheme, by reason of unsatisfactory forecourt layout and absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2. ",
    "Reason : 8 - The applicant has failed to provide a soft-landscaping scheme, thereby failing to comply the objectives set out in G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 9 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the development secures a net biodiversity gain of 10% or any relevant exemptions. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021)",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposal by reason of its siting and absence of a tree protection plan, arboricultural impact assessment, arboricultural method statement, the scheme results in an unsustainable form of development that could adversely impact on the health and longevity of existing street tree and the adjoining tree to the detriment of the ecological benefit, natural environment and visual amenity of the locality. The scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy G7, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS13 and Policies DMD2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 11 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 12 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\r\n"
