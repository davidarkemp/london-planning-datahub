    "Reason : 1 - The proposals would result in the unacceptable loss of family sized accommodation through the provision of two small flats, the upper of which by reason of size and layout failed to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space and which failed to provide adequate outdoor amenity space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policies CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical housing standards - Nationally described space standard 2015",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is capable of providing sufficient safe, secure and accessible cycle storage contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton: Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS 18 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM T1 of Merton's Sites and Polices Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposals meet the required standards for sustainable build and internal water consumption contrary to London Plan 2021 policy SI 2, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D2 and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS15.",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal provides an adequately safe and fire-resistant environment to ensure the safety of all building users, contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton London Plan policy D12 and Merton Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) policy DM D2\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed refuse and cycle storage facilities in the front garden could be suitably accommodated such that the frontage did not appear cluttered an over developed, to the detriment of the appearance and character of the wider Langdale Avenue street scene, contrary to the following Development Plan policies for Merton, London Plan 2021 policy D3 and Merton Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014) policy DM D2",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposed development, located in an area with a PTAL score of 3 (average), would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a signed legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement for the upper floor flat, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), CS20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and T1(Strategic approach to transport), T2 (Healthy Streets), T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts), and T6 (Car Parking) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\n Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
