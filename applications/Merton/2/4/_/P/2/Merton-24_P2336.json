    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of design, siting, footprint, height and depth would fail to achieve a high standard of design, resulting in an overly dominant and unsympathetic form of development that would fail to respect the host building, plot and general pattern of development in the immediate area, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with, in particular, policies DMD2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its design, siting, footprint, height and depth would be an unneighbourly form of development, resulting in loss of light, overshadowing, sense of enclosure, and an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development detrimental to the amenities of 94 and 98 Abbotsbury Road. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
