    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the detailing regarding the layout of the proposed unit the scheme has not demonstrated functionality and could result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. Overall, the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Core Strategy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of adequate and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities to all units and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of insufficient private external amenity space and lack of justification as to why it cannot be provided, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",

Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Measures, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with, in particular, policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
