    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of detailing regarding the proposed soakaway and materials, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality. The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a swept path analysis to demonstrate vehicles can be accommodated and safely accessed/egressed, it is considered the parking space would adversely impact on free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and would be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 3 - Due to the existing road layout including a central island the proposal will give rise to conditions prejudicial to the free flow of traffic and conditions of general safety for both vehicular and pedestrian movement on the public highway, contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of loss of existing on-street parking bay and absence of a parking survey to confirm the loss of existing on-street parking bay will not increase parking pressure in the locality, the scheme is considered to impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of loss of front boundary treatment, the scheme will increase visual permeability into a predominantly hard surfaced forecourt to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme therefore is not considered to positively contribution to the streetscene contrary to policy The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and draft policies D12.1, D12.3 of Merton Draft Local Plan 2022.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
