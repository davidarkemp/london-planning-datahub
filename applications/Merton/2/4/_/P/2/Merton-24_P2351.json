    "Reason : 1 - The proposal fails to demonstrate it would comply with the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) due to failure to submit correct measurements in application description, and accurate drawings of the proposed site location and block plans. A resubmission with correct information application description and drawings would therefore be required. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal fails to comply with the permitted development tolerances set out in Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) due to its size and positioning of the total enlargement of proposal over the original dwellinghouse, which includes the existing single storey rear extension to the dwellinghouse. Planning permission would therefore be required for the proposed development."
