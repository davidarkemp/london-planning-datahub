    "Reason : 1 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason: \r\n\r\nIn the absence of accurate dimensions of the eaves height of the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse, the proposal would not accord with criteria A.4(2)(a)(ii) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason:\r\n\r\nBy reason of the design of the enlargement of the dwellinghouse that would  have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and extend from a non-original rear wall, the proposed single storey rear extension enlargement would fail to comply with criteria A.1,(j) (iii) and A.1(ja) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and consequently Prior Approval is Required and Refused.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason:\r\n\r\nThe proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would create a sense of enclosure and potentially result in unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 4 St Olave's Walk. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
