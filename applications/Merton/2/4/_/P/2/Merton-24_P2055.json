  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed siting, design and proximity to the rear boundary of the single storey rear extension results in a visually obtrusive, cramped and unsympathetic form of development that would erode the character and appearance of the host site and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the unacceptable layout the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  Overall, the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Core Strategy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DM D2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of adequate and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities to all units and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a soft-landscaping scheme, the scheme fails to comply the objectives set out in, in particular, Policy G5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of absence of satisfactory off-street parking provision and absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the additional units and occupancy on site, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 8 - By reason of reduction in front boundary treatment and increase hard surfacing in the forecourt to facilitate off-street parking provision, the proposal would increase visual permeability into a predominantly hard surfaced forecourt to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality and street scene.  The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 9 - By reason of unsatisfactory parking layout and lack of satisfactory visibility splays the proposal fails to safeguard highway and pedestrian safety.  The proposal would therefore be contrary , in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed provision of 3 car parking spaces to the front garden of the application site would result in an overprovision of car parking contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 11 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Measures, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with, in particular, policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 12 - In the absence of an arboricultural survey, arboricultural impact assessment and arboricultural method statement, the proposal is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing on site and off-site (4 Southway) tree to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 13 - In the absence of sufficient detail to demonstrate that the proposal is exempt under the Biodiverstiy Net Gain requirements, the proposal fails to comply with Environment Act 2021.",
    "Reason : 14 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
