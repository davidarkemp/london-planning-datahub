    "Condition : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIt is the responsibility of the developer to make proper provision for drainage to ground, watercourses or a suitable sewer.  In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off-site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of ground water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).\r\n",

The applicant should contact the Council's Highways Team on 020 8545 3829 prior to any work starting to arrange for this work to be done. If the applicant wishes to undertake this work the Council will require a deposit and the applicant will need to cover all the Council's costs (including supervision of the works). If the works are of a significant nature, a Section 278 Agreement (Highways Act 1980) will be required and the works must be carried out to the Council's specification.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nAdvice regarding permeable and porous hardstandings can be found in the document 'Guidance on the Permeable Surfacing of Front Gardens' available at http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/pavingfrontgardens\r\n"
