    "Reason : 1 - The proposed combined hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension, by reason of their design, siting, and massing, would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the characteristic hipped roof form of this part of Rowan Road to the detriment of the visual amenity of the streetscene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies DM.D2 and DM.D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), and CS 14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
