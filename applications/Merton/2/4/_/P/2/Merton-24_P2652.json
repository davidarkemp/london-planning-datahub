If you are in any doubt about this you can get further information via https://www.merton.gov.uk/planning-and-buildings/building-control  or by emailing building.control@merton.gov.uk.\r\n",
    "Condition : 5 - Informative (Crossover Drainage) - London Borough of Merton requires a drainage channel across the full hard standing area which must drain to soft landscaping or a formulated soakaway for all vehicle crossover applications. The  drainage channel must be installed between the Hard Standing and the councils footway where the hard standing slopes towards the highway and where an open granular surfacing has not been constructed as a finished surface. Block Paving, resin surfacing, Hard Rolled fine granular surfacing and all close bound semi-pervious solutions can all clog up over time and have increased the water runoff from private property. In acceptance of this and to comply with Sec 163. Highways Act 1980, all Vehicle crossover applications must be supported by a drainage channel. Where an extension to an existing crossover is requested the drainage channel must be for the new full width including any previously approved crossover."
