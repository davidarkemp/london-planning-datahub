    "Reason : 1 -  The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, design, sheight, width, depth, scale, mass and bulk, results in a visually intrusive, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to achieve a high standard of design destroying the form, proportion and appearance of the host dwelling and the appearance of the building line of the terrace row that it forms a part of, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy D3 and D4 of the \r\nLondon Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and draft policies D12.1, D12.3 of Merton Draft Local Plan 2022.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a site specific flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development and a drainage strategy, the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, Chapters 4, 12 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS16 of Merton Core Strategy (2011) and Policies DM F1 and DM F2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
