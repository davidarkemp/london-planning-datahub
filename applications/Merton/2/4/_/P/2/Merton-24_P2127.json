    "Reason : 1 - The proposed digital screen would result in a material increase in the amount of visual street clutter which would adversely impact on the appearance of the streetscene and the character of the surrounding area. In addition it would limit views of up and down Wimbledon Hill Road and would conflict with consented landscaping plans under planning permission 21/P3163. As such the proposals are considered to fail to comply with DM D2 and DM D5 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan and policy D8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would narrow the footway for pedestrians and create an uncomfortable user experience for pedestrians and people sitting in nearby cafes and other outdoor seating areas. As such the proposals are considered harmful to pedestrian amenity and is therefore considered to fail to comply with policy DM D2 and DM D5 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan and D8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\""
