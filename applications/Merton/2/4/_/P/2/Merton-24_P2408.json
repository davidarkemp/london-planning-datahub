    "Reason : 1 - The combined siting, scale, form and massing of the proposed single storey rear extension, raised patio platform, rear outbuilding and fence works would be overdevelopment and overly dominant to the site when viewed in relation to the original dwelling and in relation to dwellings in the locality. Therefore, the proposal would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area contrary to MLP policy D12.3 and D12.3 ",
    "Reason : 2 - Officers consider the proposed development would fall contrary to MLP policy D12.3 and D12.4 in respect of neighbouring amenity by reason of unacceptable overlooking, visual intrusion and overdevelopment to the detriment of quality of living conditions of the surrounding area in respect of nos. 15b, 19b Laurel Road.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
