    "Reason : 1 - The development would result in the loss of a family sized unit (5b 5p minimum), thereby failing to comply with policy H11.1 of Merton Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of inadequate furniture layout and unsatisfactory layout would create a poor standard of internal environment for occupiers of the proposed C4 housing of multiple occupancy (HMO). The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policy D12.3 of Merton's Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 3 - The development has failed to provide adequate secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to policy T16.2 of Merton Local Plan 2024 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1, SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and Strategic Policy CC2.1 of Merton's Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a site specific flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development and a drainage strategy, the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, Chapters 4, 12 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, Strategic Policy F15.7 Flood Risk Management and Sustainable Drainage and Policies F15.8 and F15.9 of Merton's Local Plan 2024.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
