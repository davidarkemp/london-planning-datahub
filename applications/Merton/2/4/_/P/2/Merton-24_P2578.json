    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear and outrigger dormers, with associated works, and single storey rear extension, by reason of failing to demonstrate it has provided sufficient and correct drawings would be contrary to the London Plan design policies D1, D4, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear and outrigger dormers, with associated works, and single storey rear extension, by reason of their combined siting, massing and design would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, and unsympathetic form of development along the rear building line to the detriment of the visual amenity of the host property, and the surrounding area in general. The scheme would be contrary to the London Plan design policies D1, D4, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
