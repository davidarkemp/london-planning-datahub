  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, design, height, width, scale, massing, bulk and height results in a visually intrusive, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to achieve a high standard of design destroying the form, proportion and appearance of the semi-detached host dwellings and the appearance of the character of the Heatherdene Close to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and NPPF 2024 Chapters 4 and 12.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, height and depth along the common boundary would result in a visually intrusive, overbearing and dominant form of development that would create a sense of enclosure and potential impact on daylight/sunlight and overshadowing to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 15 Heatherdene Close, Mitcham . The proposals would be contrary, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and NPPF 2024 Chapters 4 and 12.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a Fire Safety Strategy incorporating but not limited to a plan detailing appropriate positioning of fire appliances and appropriate evacuation assembly points the scheme fails to provide a safe form of development for future users contrary to, in particular, Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe Existing Hip to Gable and Rear Dormer Roof Extension and Side Windows at No. 13 Heatherdene Close are not Permitted Development. As such a Planning Permission is required to regularise this development. "
