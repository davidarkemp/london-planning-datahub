    "Reason : 1 - The fencing to the front of the dwelling, by reason of its height and prominent siting represents a dominant and intrusive feature which is harmful to and detracts from the character and visual appearance of the street scene and the surrounding residential area. As such the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Polices Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n"
