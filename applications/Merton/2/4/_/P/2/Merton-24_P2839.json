    "Reason : 1 - This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED. \r\n\r\nThe proposed roof extensions would create additional cubic content which would exceed 40 cubic metres for the terraced house and would thereby fail to comply with Class B. B.1 (d)(i)\r\nof Schedule 2, Part 1, of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. Planning permission would therefore be required.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant - Refused Schemes\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\n1. Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4. Determining applications in a timely manner including providing a fast track service, details to be found on Get a quicker planning decision on LBM's website.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\nThe applicants did not seek formal pre-application advice, and the scheme was found to be contrary to policy and guidance or legislation, and subsequently refused. The Council is ready to enter into formal pre-application discussions to advise the applicants of relevant policy, guidance or legislation; and where possible assist in the preparation of a new application.\r\n"
