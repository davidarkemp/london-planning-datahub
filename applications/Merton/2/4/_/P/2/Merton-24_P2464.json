    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its siting, layout, form, design and loss of existing Hybrid Black Poplar tree, would result in an overdevelopment of the site with excessive built footprint and lack of soft landscaping, being a visually dominant form of development that fails to achieve a high standard of design or respond positively to the character and appearance of the street scene and built environment. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies D3, D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS 14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development, due to its design, height, depth, proximity to the boundary and juxtaposition with the neighbouring property, would not result in adverse loss of light to rooms within Pavilion Court, particularly those served by the east facing flank windows. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development, by reason of its design, layout and fenestration would fail to provide a high standard of residential accommodation for future occupants due to poor light levels for flats 1 and 3, flats 2 and 4 relying on light levels and outlook across land outside the applicant's ownership and poorly designed internal cycling facilities to promote sustainable modes of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies D7 and T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS 14 and CS18 of the Core planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would result in the loss of the protected and high public amenity value Hybrid Black Poplar tree for which the applicant has failed to adequately secure replacement planting or landscape enhancement of a similar or greater value to that which has been lost. The loss of the Hybrid Black Poplar tree would therefore result in harm to the visual amenities of the street scene and adversely impact on the environment and wildlife. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies G6 & G7 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS 13 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 & DM O2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the application is exempt from Biodiversity Net Gain requirements and the proposed development does not incorporate adequate measures to achieve a 10% Biodiversity Net Gain, contrary to policy G6 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS 13 of the Core planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM O2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n"
