Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4. Determining applications in a timely manner including providing a fast track service, details to be found on Get a quicker planning decision on LBM's website.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\ni) The application was amended following negotiations with the Council to ensure the scheme complied with adopted policy and guidance, and a decision was made with an agreed determination date.\r\n",
    "Condition : 28 - INFORMATIVE - Section 106 Agreement \r\nThis planning permission has a Section 106 Agreement which must be read in conjunction with it.\r\n",
    "Condition : 29 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe scheme may be liable for Mayor and Borough CIL.",
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of absence of evidence to demonstrate suitability of alternative locations to achieve similar sustainable outcome, the proposed solar panels by reason of their combined siting, design and height  are considered to result in an unsympathetic, incongruous and prominent form of development that fails to harmonise with the streetscene to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme does not comply with, in particular, Merton's Core Planning Strategy (2011) policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2011) policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its siting, height and depth are considered to result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that will adversely impact on outlook and potential overshadowing and loss of daylight/sunlight to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, the residential occupants at no. 89 Elmhurst Avenue. The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DM D2",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed legal agreement to restrict access of the additional residential unit from gaining access to residents parking permits and unsatisfactory refuse arrangement, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on parking pressure and the free flow of traffic to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety in the locality.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM T2 and DM T3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS20 of Merton Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an acoustic impact assessment or any required mitigaton measures for the ASHP, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the residential amenity of nearby occupants will be safeguarded.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM D2 and DM EP2.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposal, by reason of substandard unit size, unsatisfactory layout and access to the private amenity space for Flat 2, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of tree survey, arboricultural impact assessment, arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the proposal is considered to adversely impact on the health and longevity of nearby trees to the detriment of visual amenity of the locality and biodiversity in the Borough.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM D2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 7 - The application has failed to demonstrate a net gain in biodiversity by incorporating ecologically friendly measures exceeding existing situation, as such is contrary to, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
