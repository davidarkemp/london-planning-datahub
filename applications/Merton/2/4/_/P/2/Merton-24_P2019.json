    "Reason : 1 - The proposed outbuilding, due to the proximity to common boundaries combined with the eaves height and ridge height, would be visually harmful to the host site and surrounding area and therefore in conflict with Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed outbuilding, due to its proximity to shared boundaries combined with eaves height and roof pitch would result in an unacceptable level of visual intrusion, sense of enclosure and overshadowing to the detriment of occupiers of 135A Claremont Avenue, 137 Claremont Avenue and 121 Byron Avenue and therefore in conflict with Policies DMD2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 ",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2. ",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an arboricultural survey, arboricultural impact assessment and arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the proposal is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing trees within the immediate area to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of justification to demonstrate why it is not possible to accommodate the activities in the enlarged dwellinghouse and lack of satisfactory demonstration that the outbuilding is reasonably required for purposes ancillary to the enjoyment of the main dwellinghouse the proposal is in contrary to Chapter 12 of the NPPF and policy D3 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
