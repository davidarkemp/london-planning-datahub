    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of evidence to justify the loss of a C3 dwellinghouse, the proposal would impact on existing housing stock in the borough, contrary to, in particular, LBM Core Strategy 2011 Policy CS 9 and LBM Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DM H1 and London Plan Policy H8.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of absence of a satisfactory Transport Statement and parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the change of use, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads. The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 4 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of details to confirm the retention of existing front boundary treatment, the scheme fails to preserve or enhance the character, appearance and setting of the conservation area and the visual amenity of the locality.  The development is therefore considered to be contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM D4 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 7 - By reason of proposed change of use and intensification of occupancy within the site, the scheme would increase noise and disturbance to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policies DM D2 and DM EP2.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\n\r\nDue to ambiguity regarding the existing use (C3) had the application been considered acceptable, officers would have requested evidence from the applicant to establish the existing use"
