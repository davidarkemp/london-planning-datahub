    "Reason : 1 - The combined unacceptable siting, design, height, width, bulk and mass is considered to result in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that destroys the appearance, form and proportion of the host dwelling, the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
