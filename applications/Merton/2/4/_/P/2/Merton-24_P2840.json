    "Reason : 1 - The replacement windows by reason of their combined siting, design, absence of justification that a design that better reflect the original can not be achieved and lack of public benefit result in an unsympathetic and visually intrusive form of development that fails to preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the host dwelling and conservation area and the visual amenity of the locality.  Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, Policies DMD2, DMD3, DMD4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011, and Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of lack of public benefit and inaccurate drawings to confirm the extent of hard surfacing and works to the front boundary wall the scheme has not demonstrated it will preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the conservation area and is thus considered detrimental to the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal fails to comply with, in particular, Policies DMD2, DMD3, DMD4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011, and Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The electric meter by reason of combined siting, design, lack of evidence to demonstrate an alternative location has been fully explored to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority, results in an incongruous front garden feature that fails to preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the site and conservation area.  The proposal fails to comply with, in particular, Policies DMD2, DMD3, DMD4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policy CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011, and Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF. ",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a satisfactory and accurate Flood Risk Assessment commensurate to the scale of the development, it has not been demonstrated the scheme will safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is informed of the Enforcement Notice dated 16 October 2024 and measures required to be complied with.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is informed that there is an Article 4 Direction on the property removing permitted development rights for all works fronting the public highway.  In this instance, planning permission is required for the replacement door and works to the front boundary wall.  You are strongly advised to regularise the works or reinstate the site/works to its former condition."
