    "Reason : 1 - This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and a planning application IS REQUIRED.  \r\n\r\nBy reason of the inclusion of a fully equipped bathroom in the outbuilding, the proposal falls outside the scope of Class E as it cannot be considered as being a building incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and a planning application IS REQUIRED.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed outbuilding given its combined scale, absence of justification to demonstrate why it was not possible to accommodate some of the activities in the enlarged dwelling and lack of satisfactory demonstration that the outbuilding is reasonably required for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the main dwellinghouse fails to demonstrate compliance with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
