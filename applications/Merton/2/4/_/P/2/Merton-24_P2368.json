    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of lack of openable windows would provide an unacceptable standard of accommodation, in particular, to Bedroom 2 at ground and thus results in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers of the HMO, in particular, the HMO Licencing Requirements and policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, and polices DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies CS 8, CS9 and CS14 within the Council's Adopted Core Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of substandard layouts, lack of the demonstration of functionality of the rooms would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers for the large HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021",

    "Reason : 5 - By reason of absence of accurate drawings to demonstrate the retention of existing boundary vegetation, the scheme fails to provide satisfactory screening to the refuse stores to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",

    "Reason : 6 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain, contrary to, in accordance, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS13 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM 02 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
