    "Condition : 1 - Commencement of development (Full Permission) - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - Approved Plans - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: [132A Amended 07/01/25, Site Plan Amended 07/01/25)]",
    "Condition : 3 - Materials as Specified - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - Construction Times - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 5 - Removal of PD (Windows/Doors) - Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(England) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no window, door or other opening other than those expressly authorised by this permission shall be constructed in the side elevations without planning permission first being obtained from the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant -Approved Schemes\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\n1. Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4. Determining applications in a timely manner including providing a fast track service, details to be found on Get a quicker planning decision on LBM's website.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\ni) The application was amended during the applciation process with an agreed determination date.\r\n\r\nii) The application was amended following negotiations with the Council to ensure the scheme complied with adopted policy and guidance, and a decision was made [without delay/ with an agreed determination date].\r\n\r\niii) The application was recommended for approval and referred to the first available Planning Committee, where the agents / applicants had an opportunity to present the application.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposals would result in overdevelopment of the site and would be a bulky and visually intrusive addition when viewed from the streetscene of Milton Road, As such the proposals are considered to fail to comply with DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan and D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals due to its depth and height would be overbearing, visually intrusive and cause a harmful sense of enclosure for the adjoining neighbours at 207 Haydons Road. The proposals are also likely to cause further overshadowing. As such, the proposals are considered to fail to comply with DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\nThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\nThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming to overcome the concerns by officers. \r\n"
