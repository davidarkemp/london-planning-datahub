    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the discrepancies between the submitted development description and scheme illustrated in the proposed plans officers are unable to ascertain the nature of the proposed change of use application.  The scheme therefore fails to comply with the provisions set out in the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by reason of substandard room layouts, potential lack of communal spaces, absence of windows to the first floor lounge and lack of the demonstration of functionality would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers for the HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies London Plan 2021 policy D6, CS 9 & CS.14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of satisfactory refuse and recycling storage facilities for the development, the proposal fails to accord with Policies SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021, Merton Core Strategy 2011 policies CS14 & CS17 and Policies DM D2 of the SPP 2014",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe submitted Locaiton Plan is not valid and therefore is not included within the drawing numbers",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is reminded that they must regularise the existing two storey rear extension and the rear dormer by way of a Section 191 Cerificate or planning application. Failure to do so is likely to result in enforcement action"
