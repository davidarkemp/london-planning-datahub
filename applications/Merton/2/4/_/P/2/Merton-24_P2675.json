    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of the insufficient depth to facilitate the creation of a front garden parking space would result in a unsafe form of development that would adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. The proposal fails to demonstrate it would comply with the aims and objectives of: London Plan 2021 policies D3, D4, and T6, and Merton Local Plan 2024 policies S12.1, D12.2, D12.3 T.16.3 and T16.4.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 policies SI 12 and SI 13, Merton Local Plan 2024 policies F15.7, F15.8 and F15.9.",
    "Reason : 3 - The demolition of existing front boundary wall in its entirety by reason of siting and design would result in an incongruous form of development that fails to make a positive contribution to the visual amenity of the locality.   The proposal fails to demonstrate it would comply with the aims and objectives of London Plan 2021 policies D3, D4 and Merton Local Plan 2024 policy D12.2.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
