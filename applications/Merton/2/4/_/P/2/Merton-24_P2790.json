    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would fail to achieve a high standard of design by reason of design, height, bulk, massing and form, resulting in an incongruous, visually obtrusive, dominant and prominent form of overdevelopment that would adversely impact on the character and appearance of the area.  The proposed development is therefore in conflict with, in particular, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of design, siting, combined height, massing, bulk and depth would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 9 and 5 The Bungalows.  The proposal would be in conflict with, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would fail to achieve a high standard of design by reason of layout and design, resulting in poor outlook and noise and disturbance, representing an over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policies DM D2 and DM EP2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development by reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to all the bike stores, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Cycle Design Standards (2014), London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 (2021),  and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 5 - The proposed development, located in an area with a PTAL score of 4 (good), would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a signed legal agreement securing a 'car free' agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), CS20 (Parking, Servicing and Delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and T1(Strategic approach to transport), T2 (Healthy Streets), T4 (Assessing and mitigating transport impacts), and T6 (Car Parking) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of an arboricultural impact assessment, arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not adversely impact on the health and longevity of nearby trees to the detriment of visual amenity of the locality and biodiversity in the Borough.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM D2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
