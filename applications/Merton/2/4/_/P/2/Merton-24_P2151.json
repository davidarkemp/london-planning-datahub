  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed change of use to mixed use of C1/C3 would result in the loss of permanent housing, adversely impacting on housing choice and delivery of housing in Merton and London, contrary to Policies H1, H8 and H9 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies H11.1 and H11.2 of the Merton Local Plan 2024 - 2037/38 ",

    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the minimum internal water efficiency standard of 105 litres per person per day, in conflict with Policy CC2.6 of the Merton Local Plan 2024 - 2037/38.",
