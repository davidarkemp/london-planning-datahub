    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of an operation statement, the proposed change of use has the potential to increase footfall on site which would lead to an increase in noise and disturbance to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policies DM D2 and DM EP2",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision for staff and users of the F1 facility, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 3 - The development has failed to provide sufficient, convenient and accessible refuse provision. Therefore, the scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4, SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021, Merton Core Strategy 2011 policies CS14 & CS17 and Policies DM D2, (plus highway policies) of the SPP 2014",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of a satisfactory Transport Statement and parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the change of use, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads. The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a site specific Flood Risk Assessment, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality. The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant/agent is advised to ensure that the application form has the correct development description and ensure that the correct use is stated."
