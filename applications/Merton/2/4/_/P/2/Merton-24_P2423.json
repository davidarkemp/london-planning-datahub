    "Reason : 1 - By reason of combined scale, massing and siting the single storey rear extension results in a visually obtrusive form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and result in overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular no. 11 Windermere Avenue. The scheme is contrary to in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).    ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE: The submitted drawings are not accurate. The depth of the proposal is inconsistent and the labelling is incorrect. The applicant shall be reminded that accurate and consistent drawings are required on any subsequent application. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant - Refused Schemes\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\n1. Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4. Determining applications in a timely manner including providing a fast track service, details to be found on Get a quicker planning decision on LBM's website.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\nThe applicants did not seek formal pre-application advice, and the scheme was found to be contrary to policy and guidance, and subsequently refused. The Council is ready to enter into formal pre-application discussions to advise the applicants of relevant policy and guidance; and where possible assist in the preparation of a new planning permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
