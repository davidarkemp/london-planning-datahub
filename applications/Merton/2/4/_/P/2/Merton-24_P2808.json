    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the unacceptable floor to ceiling height and absence of justification of lack of private amenity space, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary, in particular, London Plan 2021 policy D6, policy CS 9 & CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity to accommodate the parking demand form the new unit, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on-street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The roof extension (involving altering/raising the ridge height), by reason of its combined siting, height, design and appearance, results in a prominent, visually intrusive, unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to respect the form and appearance of the host property and the terrace row that it forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The development is therefore considered to be contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
