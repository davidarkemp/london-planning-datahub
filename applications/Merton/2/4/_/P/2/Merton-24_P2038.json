  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey extension, due to the combined siting, scale, height, roof form and materials, would lead to a visually intrusive, incongruous and excessive form of overdevelopment which fails to preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the conservation area and the wider street scheme and therefore in conflict with, in particular, Policies DMD2, DM D4 and DMD3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed addition, due to its proximity to the boundary with Flat 1, 32 Mitcham Park combined with eaves height and roof pitch would result in an unacceptable level of visual intrusion, sense of enclosure and overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, occupiers of Flat 1, 32 Mitcham Park and therefore in conflict with Policies DMD2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal by reason of its siting and absence of a tree protection plan, arboricultural impact assessment and arboricultural method statement, the scheme results in an unsustainable form of development that could adversely impact on the health and longevity of existing trees within the immediate area to the detriment of the ecological benefit, natural environment and visual amenity of the locality. The scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy G7, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS13 and Policies DMD2, DM D4 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2. ",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
