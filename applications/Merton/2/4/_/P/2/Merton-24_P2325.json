    "Reason : 1 - It is the view of the Council that the existing use does not fall within Use Class B8 (Storage and Distribution). Therefore, the allowances under Class P of the General Permitted Development Order do not apply in this instance. Officers are of the view that the storage building forms an ancillary part of the existing C3 use at no. 23 Montague Road. As such, full planning permission should be sought under a householder planning application should the accommodation be ancillary to no. 23. Alternatively, if the storage building is proposed to be converted into a self-contained dwellinghouse then full planning permission would be required under a standard application for such a change.",
    "Reason : 2 - The development fails to comply with parts P.1. (a),(b) and P.2 (a) under Class P within Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015 as no statement of evidence has been submitted as regard to the existing B8 use. ",
    "Reason : 3 - Prior approval has not been sought as regard to the potential impacts of the development on air quality, highways, contamination, flooding and noise contrary to P.2. (b) under Class P within Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 2015. "
