    "Reason : 1 - The proposal by reason of its combined siting, width, design, size, scale and mass would result in an unreasonably overbearing, visually obtrusive and incongruous form of overdevelopment that would enclosure a distinctive gap and fails to represent a high quality design to the detriment of the visual amenity of the streetscene. The proposal would fail to accord with the principles of, in particular, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Merton Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and draft policies D12.2, D12,3 and D12.4 of Merton's Draft New Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
