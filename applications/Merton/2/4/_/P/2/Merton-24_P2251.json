    "Reason : 1 - The proposal is considered to conflict with planning policy relating to design and visual impact. The siting, appearance, scale, bulk and massing of the proposal would amount to overdevelopment, be unduly visually dominant when viewed in its context, and would compromise the inherent spacious character of the locality contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D3, and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DMD2.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of excessive scale, form and massing, the proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Drax Avenue Conservation Area contrary to Chapter 16 of the NPPF (2023), London Plan (2021) policy HC1, Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DMD4.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would harm the amenity of no. 90 and 92 Copse Hill, and No 1 Drax Avenue by way of increased sense of enclosure and perceived loss of privacy contrary to Merton Sites and Policies plan (2014) policy DMD2.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development would not deliver Biodiversity Net Gain of 10% and in the absence of a legal agreement securing exemption for self-build or custom build development, the proposed development fail to adhere to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (inserted by the Environment Act 2021).\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice\r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
