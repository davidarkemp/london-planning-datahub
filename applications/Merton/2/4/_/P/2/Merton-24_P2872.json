    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of any marketing evidence to confirm the lack of demand of existing use and/or other employment generating uses and community uses for a period of 30 months is considered to not comply with SPP (2014) Policy DM E3 and Core Strategy policies CS3 and CS12. \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of overall siting, height, bulk and massing, the proposed building represents a cramped form of overdeveloment that would adversely impact on the garden character of the area that the site forms a part of to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme is therefore in conflict with Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM01 and DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of siting, footprint and absence of potential for replacement tree planting/soft landscaping, the scheme fails to enhance landscape features contrary to, in particular, policy DM O2 of Mertons Sites and Policy PLan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed development by reason of its siting, design, depth and height  would result in a visually intrusive, overbearing and dominant form of development that would create a sense of enclosure, loss of privacy and overlooking to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants. The proposals would be contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Core Strategy Policy CS14 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of the unacceptable layout and insufficient private amenity space the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision for each unit and enclosures, the scheme is considered to harm the visual amenity of the host site and has the potential to impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy D3, SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021, DM D2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of the provision of required off-street parking and/or parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking demand arising from the proposed development, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 20, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM T2 and London Plan policies T5 and T6.1.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of a satisfactory flood risk assessment and drainage strategy commensurate to the nature and scale of the development the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.  \r\n",
    "Reason : 10 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement and water usage statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 11 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain, contrary to Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 12 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
