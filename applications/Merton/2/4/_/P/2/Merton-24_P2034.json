    "Reason : 1 - The proposed external staircase with associated screening by reason of combined unacceptable siting, height and design would represent an unneighbourly and visually intrusive form of development that would lead to a loss of privacy, outlook and create a sense of enclosure and potential loss of light to the detriment of the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers, in particular, no. 106 Tynemouth Road. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with, in particular, policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and draft policies D12.1 and D12.4 of Merton Draft New Local Plan.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
