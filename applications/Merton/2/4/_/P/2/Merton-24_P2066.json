    "Reason : 1 - The proposal would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation as the flat would fail to meet the minimum space standards contrary to London Plan policy D6. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The overall, siting, layout and scale of the development is such that it would compromise the open character of that defines the rear of terrace properties in the area. The proposal would also be unduly dominant when viewed from the rear of nearby properties, particularly no. 4 Hanover Road and no. 53 and 51a Deburgh Road. Accordingly the proposal would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the local area contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DMD2. ",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would fail to preserve a suitable standard of amenity of neighbouring properties contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD2 as the scale and siting of the proposal would harm no. 4 Hanover Road and no. 53 Denburgh Road by way of increased sense of enclosure and harmful impacts to outlook. The proposal would also have an unacceptable level of overshadowing towards the rear garden of no. 51 Deburgh Road. ",
    "Reason : 4 - No air quality neutral statement has been submitted alongside the proposal therefore Officers are unable to conclude the development would be air quality neutral contrary to London Plan (2021) Policy SI6.",
    "Reason : 5 - No details of SUDs have been provides contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DMF2 (i) which requires all new development to consider the use of SUDS.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a legal agreement or parking survey to demonstrate local capacity, the proposal would result in an unacceptable impact on parking pressure in the locality contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DMT2.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n"
