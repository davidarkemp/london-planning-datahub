    "Condition : 6 - The development hereby approved shall implement the flood mitigation measures as submitted with the proposal titled: EA FRA Matrix. These measures shall thereafter be retained in perpetuity \r\n\r\nReason: To reduce the risk of flooding and to comply with the following DevelopmentPlan policies for Merton: policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS16 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM F2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant should be aware that the site may provide a useful habitat for swifts.

    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE (Party Wall Act) - The applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building.

    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant - Scheme Amended During Application Lifecycle\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\n1. Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4. Determining applications in a timely manner including providing a fast track service, details to be found on Get a quicker planning decision on LBM's website.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\nii) The application was amended following negotiations with the Council to ensure the scheme complied with adopted policy and guidance, and a decision was made [without delay/ with an agreed determination date].",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined siting, design, height, width, depth, scale, mass and bulk, results in a visually intrusive, dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to achieve a high standard of design destroying the form, proportion and appearance of the host dwelling and the appearance of the building line of the semi-detached dwelling that it forms a part of, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a site specific flood risk assessment commensurate to the nature and scale of the development and a drainage strategy, the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, Chapters 4, 12 and 14 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS16 of Merton Core Strategy (2011) and Policies DM F1 and DM F2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
