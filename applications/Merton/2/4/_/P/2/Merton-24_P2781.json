    "Reason : 1 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason:\r\n\r\nUnder A.4(3)(b) the developer has provided insufficient information to enable the authority to establish whether the proposed development complies with the conditions, limitations or restrictions applicable to development permitted by Class A which exceeds the limits in paragraph A.1(f) but is allowed by paragraph A.1(g) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)Order 2015 (as amended)\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason:\r\n\r\nThe proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (GPDO) 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension in the absence of drawings, could have the potential to be an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that could create a sense of enclosure and result in unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no.34 and 38 Hawkes Road. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)."
