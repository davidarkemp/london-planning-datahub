  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development would have an unacceptable design and diminish the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area in conflict with NPPF para 130, London Plan policy D4, and Local Plan policy D12.3 and D12.4. This is due to the unacceptable scale, form, siting and design of the front boundary, skylight, second floor dormer, and rear bay windows and rear central glazing. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear bay windows would be overly intrusive and result in an undue increase in perceived overlooking towards the gardens of neighbouring properties either side, namely no. 37 and 39 Lingfield Road. As a result the proposal would be in conflict with NPPF para 130, and Local Plan policy D12.2 and D12.4.",
    "Reason : 3 - Officers consider the front boundary, front dormer, skylight,  rear bay windows and rear central glazed window would detract from character of the host dwelling harm to the significance of the dwelling itself and wider Conservation Area.  Accordingly, the proposal would conflict with NPPF para 199 and 200 which gives great weight to the conservation of designated heritage assets irrespective of the level of harm. The proposal would also conflict with NPPF para 209 as the harm to the locally listed building is not considered to be outweighed by other benefits.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
