    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey wrap around extension, by reason of its design, form, scale and bulk would result in an incongruous and unneighbourly form of development which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and wider area and would result in undue visual intrusion, loss of outlook and loss of daylight/overshadowing to the neighbouring occupiers at no.45 Courtney Road. Thereby the proposal does not accord with London Plan policies D3 and D4, Core Srategy Policies CS14 and SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required.\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
