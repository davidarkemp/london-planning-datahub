    "Condition : 3 - Materials as Specified - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - No Use of Flat Roof  - Access to the flat roof of the development hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 5 - Screening - The screening to the roof terrace as shown on the approved plans shall be carried out with obscured glazing and implemented before the development is first occupied and retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Condition : 6 - Construction Times - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant - Scheme Amended During Application Lifecycle\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\n1. Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4. Determining applications in a timely manner including providing a fast track service, details to be found on Get a quicker planning decision on LBM's website.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\ni) The application was amended following negotiations with the Council to ensure the scheme complied with adopted policy and guidance, and a decision was made [without delay/ with an agreed determination date].\r\n\r\nii) The application was recommended for approval and referred to the first available Planning Committee, where the agents / applicants had an opportunity to present the application.",
    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE (Party Wall Act) - The applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building. Further information is available at the following link: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/party-walls-building-works\r\n",
    "Condition : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nBuilding Regulations \r\nPlease note that this is a planning permission only and you may also require approval under the Building Regulations. If you are in any doubt about this you can get further information via https://www.merton.gov.uk/planning-and-buildings/building-control  or by emailing building.control@merton.gov.uk.\r\n",
    "Condition : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant should be aware that the site may provide a useful habitat for swifts. Swifts are currently in decline in the UK and in order to encourage and improve the conservation of swifts the applicant is advised to consider the installation of swift nesting box/bricks on site.\r",
    "Reason : 1 - The combined proposed L-shaped dormer roof extension and roof terrace by reason of its combined siting and design would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would introduce an incongruous design feature at roof level to the detriment of the visual amenity of the host property, the terrace row it forms a part of and the surrounding area in general. The scheme would be contrary to the London Plan design policies D1, D4, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed rear dormer roof extension and rear roof terrace with associated enclosure by reason of their combined siting, depth and height would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would result in unacceptable sense of enclosure to nearby occupants, in particular, the occupants of the first floor flat at no. 56 Fortescue Road. In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that noise impacts would be adequately addressed. The scheme is contrary to the SPP 2014 policies DM D2, DM D3.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
