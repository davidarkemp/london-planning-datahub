    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of design, sitting, height, massing, form and excessive depth, would result in an overbearing, unduly dominant, visually intrusive form of development; creating loss of light and unacceptable sense of enclosure detrimental to the amenities of 3 Beeleigh Road. The proposal would be contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and would therefore fail to comply with Schedule 2, Class A, Part 1 (criteria A.4(7) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the maximum height discrepancies between the written application form and as shown on the proposed plan (drawing PP/03), the scheme fails to comply with Schedule 2, Class A, Part 1 (criteria A.4(2) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
