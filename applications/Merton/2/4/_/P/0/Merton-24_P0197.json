This is because Officers cannot make a determination as to whether the proposed single storey rear extension would comply with the provisions of the conditions, limitations or restrictions application to development permitted by Class A which exceeds the limits in paragraph A1(f) but is allowed by paragraph A.1(g) of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is informed that had accurate drawings been submitted including the existing rear addition, the proposed extension would be considered to extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, therefore the scheme would have failed to comply with criteria A.A.1 (j) of Class A Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).
