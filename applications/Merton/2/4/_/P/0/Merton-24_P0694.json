    "Reason : 1 - The development by reason of its combined siting, design, height, bulk and massing is considered to represent an unsympathetic, incongruous and congested form of overdevelopment that is out of character with the pattern of development to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The proposal therefore be contrary to, in particular, the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its combined siting in close proximity to the common boundaries, height and depth, results in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of visual intrusion and potentially impact on daylight/sunlight and cause overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, the property at no.2 Elm Close. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers due to inadequate internal and external amenity spaces. The new dwelling would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015 The proposals would fail to comply with policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) ",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus failed to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2. ",
    "Reason : 7 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a water usage statement it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use to achieve susta inable design and construction. The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Policies SI 2, SI 3 and SI 4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS15 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of an arboricultural survey, arboricultural impact assessment and arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the proposal is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing tree adjacent to the site to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
