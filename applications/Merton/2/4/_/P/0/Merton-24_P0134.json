    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by virtue of its scale, being capable of being self-contained with independent access, and affording all day-to-day living and amenity requirements independent of the main dwellinghouse, cannot be considered to be ancillary accommodation. The development is not acceptable as a new dwelling due to the adverse visual impact from the proposed roof form, safe access/egress to the highway has not been demonstrated, lack of cycle parking, biodiversity impact, failure to demonstrate that flooding considerations are acceptable, failure to demonstrate air quality neutral development & the impact on trees has not been demonstrated to be acceptable, contrary to London Plan policies D3, D4, T4, T5, T6.1, SI 1, SI 12, SI 13, G6 and G7, Policies CS13, CS14, CS15, CS16, CS18 and CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2, DM D3, DM F1, DM F2, DM O2, DM T3 and DM T5 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development, by reason of its form, design, character/appearance has failed to achieve a high standard of design, failing to relate positively and appropriately to the context of the site, character and appearance of the area and would conflict with London Plan policies D3 and D4, Core Strategy policy CS 14 and SPP Policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 3 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate, with a lack of information being provided, that the development would comply with adopted planning policies and that the development would not have a harmful impact on flooding, air quality (air quality neutral), biodiversity (net gain), green corridor, trees and sustainability in conflict with Policy SI 1, SI 2, SI 12, SI 13, G6 and G7 of the London Plan, Policy CS13, CS14, CS15, CS16 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2, DM F1, DM F2 and DM O2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n"
