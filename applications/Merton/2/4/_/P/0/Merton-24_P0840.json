    "Reason : 1 - Prior approval is required and refused.  \r\nThe proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would create a unacceptable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of the adjoining occupants at no.66 and 70 St James' Road. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). "
