  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the unacceptable internal layout and insufficient private amenity space for occupiers of Maisonette 2 the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The proposal would be contrary to, in particular, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policies CS 9 & CS14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of detailing of the alleyway including access and lighting, the scheme has not demonstrated that it would create a safe developoment in line with Secured by Design principles. As such it would contrary to, in particular, DMD2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of detailing of the front boundary treatmentl, the scheme would increase visual permeability into a predominately hard surfaced forecourt which fails to positively contribute to the visual amenity of the streetscene contrary to, in particular, DMD2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - Due to inaccurate drawings the council are unable to ascertain the impact on the character and appearance of the host site or the surrounding area nor are they able to assess the impact on neighbour amenity. It is therefore concluded that the proposal would fail to comply with the principles of policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, CS 14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 6 - The development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities, contrary to policy  DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a suitable Flood Risk Assessment, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2. ",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional dwellings over and above the number of units currently on the site are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nThe applicant is informed of the need to submit a full set of accurate drawings and Site Location Plan with any planning applications."
