    "Reason : 1 - By reason of the combined unacceptable layout, access to private amenity space for Flat B and lack of sufficient floor to ceiling height the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, Policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM H1 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a landscaping scheme and confirmation of a net gain in biodiversity by incorporating ecologically friendly measures in the construction process, the proposal is contrary to, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of absence of a parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall arising from the increase in occupancy on site, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on-street parking to the detriment of the free flow of traffic in the locality and highway and pedestrian safety and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to highway safety and sustainable transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a satisfactory Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality. The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of unsatisfactory location of cycle parking for Flat B, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and fails to provide a sustainable form of development.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 20, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM T2 and London Plan policies T5.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of unsatisfactory location of refuse storage, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety and fails to provide a sustainable form of development.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS 20, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policy DM T2 and London Plan policies T5.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
