    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive scale and form would remove the main open view behind the shops and flats to the detriment of the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, failing to either preserve or enhance it. The proposal would also have a negative impact on the setting of the Locally Listed Building 1 The Green. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive scale and form would cause harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers at property 1 The Green, by reason of a loss of light and overbearing impact. As such the proposal would fail to comply with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive scale and form would cause a harmful impact on the rear servicing of the existing commercial units, with particular regard to bin and recycling servicing and storage. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy T7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
