    "Condition : 17 - INFORMATIVE\r\nTfL have identified some design changes that may assist to improve journey time delays at the junction and/or on the bus routes affected. TfL are satisfied for these to be investigated at the detailed design stage in consultation with TfL, post planning. These would include but not be limited to the following: \r\n1. Relocate southern traffic island as far south as the hatching width allows to match the island width. \r\n2. Amend hatching on the north side of the junction. \r\n3. 'square' off the nose of the north side splitter island on Carshalton Road which could enable the studs and stop line to be moved further apart slightly and enable the stop line to be moved further south. \r\n4. Review any kerbside controls and parking. \r\n5. Install call cancel and countdowns at all signalised crossings and junctions. \r\n6. Provide inline bus stops, i.e. remove any laybys. \r\n7. Review surfacing in the location and approaches/departures to bus stops. \r\n",
    "Condition : 18 - INFORMATIVE\r\nYou are advised to contact the Council's Highways team on 020 8545 3700 before undertaking any works within the Public Highway to obtain the necessary approvals and/or licences. Please be advised that there is a further charge for this work.

    "Condition : 19 - INFORMATIVE\r\nAny works/events carried out either by, or at the behest of, the developer, whether they are located on, or affecting a prospectively maintainable highway, as defined under Section 87 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, or on or affecting the public highway, shall be co-ordinated under the requirements of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 and the Traffic management Act 2004 and licensed accordingly in order to secure the expeditious movement of traffic by minimising disruption to users of the highway network in Merton. Any such works or events commissioned by the developer and particularly those involving the connection of any utility to the site, shall be co-ordinated by them in liaison with the London Borough of Merton, Network Coordinator, (telephone 020 8545 3976). This must take place at least one month in advance of the works and particularly to ensure that statutory undertaker connections/supplies to the site are co-ordinated to take place wherever possible at the same time.\r\n",
