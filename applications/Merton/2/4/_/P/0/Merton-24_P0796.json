    "Reason : 1 - The height and depth of the proposed rear extension would result in an overbearing increased sense of enclosure and loss daylight in respect the rear and side facing windows of unit 04 and 07 as approved under planning permission 21/P2582 at no 337-339 Haydon's Road. The proposal would also have an overbearing increased sense of enclosure upon the first floor outdoor amenity space of unit 04 as shown on the approved plans under permission 21/P2582  at no  337-339 Haydon's Road. The height and depth of the proposed rear extension would result in an overbearing increased sense of enclosure in respect of the first floor rear facing window at no. 343 Haydon's Road. Np details of extraction for the retained caf� have been provided. Therefore, the proposal could result in harmful odours and noise for prospective occupants and nearby neighbours. For these reasons the proposal would fall contrary to NPPF para 130 (a) and Merton SPP policy DMD2 (v and vi) in respect of preserving amenity of neighbouring properties. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a submitted Flood Risk Assessment the proposal would fail to comply with Merton SPP policy DMF1 in respect of demonstrating the development would not result in an increase in flood risk. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a Sustainable Urban Drainage Strategy or Floor Risk Assessment, Officers are unable to conclude the proposal has considered SUDS and demonstrate sustainable approaches to the management of surface water contrary to Merton SPP (2014) policy DMF2.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an air quality neutral assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate the proposal would be air quality neutral contrary to London Plan policy SI1. ",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a legal agreement restricting occupants from obtaining parking permits in the Controlled Parking Zone, and in the absence of a local parking survey, Officers are unable to conclude the proposal would not result in undue parking pressure in the local area contrary to Merton SPP policy DMT3 and Merton SPP policy DMT2. ",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
