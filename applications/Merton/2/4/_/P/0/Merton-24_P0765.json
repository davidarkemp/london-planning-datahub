Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to London Plan policy D3 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) DMD2 in respect of visual impact, character and appearance. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would have harmful impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties contrary to NPPF para 130 (f) and Merton SPP policy DMD2 , notably:\r\n- no. 69 The Ridgeway by way overbearing increased sense of enclosure\r\n-no. 74 and 75 Denmark Road by way of overbearing increased sense of enclosure \r\n-no. 1c Denmark Road by way of loss of daylight, sunlight and overbearing increased sense of enclosure.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposal would harm the significance of the Wimbledon West Conservation Area due to the the scale, form, design, siting, and appearance of the proposed building. The public benefits of the proposal do not serve to outwigh the harm identified as such the proposal falls contary to relevant paragraphs in Chapter 16 of the NPPF, London Plan policy HC1, and Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD4.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal fails to provide or robustly justify the lack of provision of outdoor amenity space for the proposed dwelling thereby falling contrary to London Plan policy D6 (F,9)",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere appropraite, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
