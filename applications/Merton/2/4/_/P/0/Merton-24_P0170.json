  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed acoustic fence, by reason of the substantial forward projection, siting, height and appearance would fail to achieve a high standard of design, resulting in an alien and visually intrusive additional to the streetscene, which would have an overbearing effect when viewed from the street and would result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development and in particular the proposed hours of operation would not adversely impact on neighbouring amenity byway of cumulative impact from all sources of noise disturbance, light impact and vibration to surrounding residential properties contrary to Policies DM D2 and DM EP2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed workshop building, by reason of bulk and massing and the proximity to the shared boundary and juxtaposition of neighbouring properties, would fail to achieve a high standard of design, resulting in a loss of outlook, unreasonable sense of enclosure and overbearing form of development to the detriment of neighbouring amenity. In the absence of daylight/sunlight assessment, the proposal would also fail to demonstrate that the loss of light to properties at nos.36-39 Garth Close would be within acceptable tolerances, contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposed acoustic fence, by reason of the bulk, massing, height, siting and forward projection and the proximity to the shared boundary and juxtaposition of neighbouring properties, would result  in loss of light, loss of outlook, unreasonable sense of enclosure and overbearing form, adversely impacting on the residential amenities of 222 Garth Road, contrary to Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of the limited provision of on-site car parking, proposed hours of operation and lack of justification for this under provision, including alternative sustainable transport options, in a low PTAL area, the proposal has failed to demonstrate that it would not result in harmful displacement car parking and congestion on the road network, contrary to Policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM T1, DM T2 and DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 6 - Due to the lack of a swept path analysis drawing showing double decker buses, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that vehicular access to the site could be safely achieved, in conflict with Policies T4 and T7 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM T2 and DM T5 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 7 - Due to the lack of a signed and sealed legal agreement to secure a financial contribution of �10,000 towards the impact on the highway network, �2,000 for Travel Plan monitoring and a Parking Management Strategy (as requested by TFL), the proposal has failed to demonstrate that the impact on the local highway network would be acceptable, contrary to Policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS18 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM T2, DM T3 and DM T4 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 8 - Notwithstanding the submitted fire strategy and addendum, in the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to London Plan policies D5(B5) and D12A.",
    "Reason : 9 - The submitted preliminary ecological assessment advises that bat surveys (Preliminary Bat Roost assessment) should be undertaken prior to the demolition of any buildings on site, as features suitable for bat occupation were identified on the existing building (missing bricks, open or damaged windows and continuously open doors). These additional surveys have not been carried out and, as such, the need for any potential bat mitigation has not been fully assessed or integrated into the proposals. Therefore, the application has failed to demonstrate that the impact on protected species would be acceptable, in conflict with Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but the revisions to the scheme did not overcome the concerns raised. \r\n"
