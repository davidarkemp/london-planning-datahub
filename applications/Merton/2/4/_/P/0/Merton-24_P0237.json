  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of evidence to justify the conversion from C3 to C2, including the loss of a C3 dwellinghouse, the proposal would impact on existing housing stock on the borough, contrary to LBM Core Strategy 2011 Policy CS 14 and LBM Sites and Policies Plan 2014  DM H1",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of the lack of detailing regarding bedroom arrangments the proposal has the potential to provide a substandard level of accomodation, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, Policies D6 and D7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM H1 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of information regarding the capacity, staffing hours and the care provided, it has not been demonstrated that the development would safeguard the amenities of nearby neighbours in terms of noise. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particulary, policy DMD2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the change of use, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads. The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a satisfactory Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality. The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a landscaping scheme and confirmation of a net gain in biodiversity by incorporating ecologically friendly measures in the construction process, the proposal is contrary to, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
