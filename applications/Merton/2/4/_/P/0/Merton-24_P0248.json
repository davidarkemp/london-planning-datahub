    "Reason : 2 - The proposed dwelling due to its excessive height, bulk and massing would fail to relate positively and appropriately to the rhythm, scale, proportions, height, and massing of surrounding buildings to the detriment of the Ridgway Place streetscene contrary to policy DM D2 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014) and policy CS14 of the Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
