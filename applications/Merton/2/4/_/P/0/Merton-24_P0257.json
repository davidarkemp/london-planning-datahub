    "Reason : 2 - \r\nPrior approval is REQUIRED and REFUSED.  The proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (GPDO) 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth results in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no.3 and no. 5 Appleton Square,.  The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).\r\n"
