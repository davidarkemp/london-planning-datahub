    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its loss of original materiality and introduction of inappropriate design and UPVC framed windows fails to preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the streetscene and John Innes Conservation Area. This would amount to less than substantial harm to the heritage asset for which there is no outweighing public benefit. As such it would fail to comply with, in particular, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and NPPF 2023 Chapter 16.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a full and accurate set of drawings that clearly defines the proposed development, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposal will preserve or enhance the appearance of the host dwelling, the setting, character and appearance of the John Innes conservation area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The proposal therefore would amount to less than substantial harm to the heritage asset for which there is no outweighing public benefit.  As such it would fail to comply with, in particular, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and NPPF 2023 Chapter 16. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nA full and accurate set of existing and proposed plans and elevations to a recognisable scale (1:50 and or 1:100) and scale bar should be submitted with any future submisison."
