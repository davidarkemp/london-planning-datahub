    "Reason : 1 - The proposed extensions, by reason of the its combined siting, design, height, depth and width results in a dominant, cramped and congested form of overdevelopment that would cause harm to the host site and local area resulting a negative impact to the character and appearance to the host site and terrace in which it forms a part of, contrary to, in particular, London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, policy CS.14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014)",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its combined siting, scale, bulk and mass results in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants. The scheme is contrary to policy DMD2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014)",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
