    "Reason : 1 - The proposed replacement roof, five rooflights to rear dormer, 1 rooflight to rear outrigger and installation of 8 solar panels and absence of details of potential alternative solar panels layout to achieve the same sustainable benefit by reason of their combined siting, design and appearance results in an unsympathetic form of development that fails to achieve a high standard of design to the detriment of the setting, character and appearance of the Lambton Road street scene and Lambton Road Conservation Area.  The scheme results in less than substantial harm and it has not been demonstrated there to be any public benefit to outweigh the harm on the setting, character and appearance of the designated heritage asset.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies DMD2 (Design considerations in all developments) & DMD3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) and DMD4 (Managing heritage assets) of Merton's Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy CS14 (Design) of Merton's Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach) & D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
