    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of unsatisfactory layout and inadequate internal floorspace represents over-intensification and over-development of the site failing to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The proposals would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015. The proposals would fail to comply with policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of absence of additional onsite parking and absence of sufficient and accurate parking survey following Lambeth Methodology to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the increased number of occupiers, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic to the detriment of pedestrian and highway safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
