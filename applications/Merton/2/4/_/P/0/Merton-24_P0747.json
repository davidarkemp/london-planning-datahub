    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of evidence to justify the conversion from C3 to C2, including the loss of a C3 dwellinghouse, the proposal would impact on existing housing stock on the borough, contrary to, in particular, LBM Core Strategy 2011 Policy CS 14 and LBM Sites and Policies Plan 2014 Policy DM H1.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that future occupiers are prevented from being able to obtain business parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is informed that any future submissions must be accompanied with plans that comply with the national requirements."
