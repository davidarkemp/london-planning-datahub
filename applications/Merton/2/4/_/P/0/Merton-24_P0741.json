    "Reason : 1 - The proposed first floor extension, balcony and crown roof by reason of their combined siting, design, height, depth, bulk and mass are considered to result in an incongruous, prominent and dominant form of overdevelopment of the site that destroys the form and proportion of the host property to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality.  The scheme does not comply with, in particular, Merton's Core Planning Strategy (2011) policy CS 14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2011) policies DM D2 and DM D3.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor extension, balcony and associated side screening panels, by reason of their siting, height and depth are considered to result in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that will adversely impact on outlook and the create an opportunity for overlooking, loss of privacy, prolong stay generating noise and disturbance and potential overshadowing and loss of daylight/sunlight to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, the residential occupants at no. 89 and 93 Elmhurst Avenue. The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan policy DM D2",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed legal agreement to restrict access of the additional residential unit from gaining access to residents parking permits and unsatisfactory refuse arrangement, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on parking pressure and the free flow of traffic to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety in the locality.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM T2 and DM T3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS20 of Merton Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a site specific flood risk assessment and detailed Sustainable Drainage Strategy commensurate to the nature and scale of the development the scheme is considered to increase risk of flooding in the locality contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2. ",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of an acoustic impact assessment or any required mitigaton measures for the ASHP, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the residential amenity of nearby occupants will be safeguarded.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM D2 and DM EP2.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the bike store for Flat 1, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 6 - By reason of unsatisfactory layout and access to the bike store for Flat 1, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",

    "Reason : 7 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain, contrary to Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nWhilst the application has been submitted as an extension, officers consider the scheme to be commensurate to demolition and rebuild.  Had the scheme been considered acceptable, further clarification and evidence would have been sought.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Local Plan policies have been quoted in the submitted Energy Statement.  Had the scheme been considered acceptable, corrections would have been requested.\r\n\r\nSolar PV panels are shown on the proposed roof plan.  Had the scheme been considered acceptable, amended elevations including PV panels would have been requested for completeness.\r\n\r\nAmendments were not sought prior to determination given the receipt of corrected plans would not have changed officer recommendation and would have incurred additional costs for the applicant.\r\n"
