    "Reason : 1 - The scale, form, design, and positioning of the proposals would be incongruous, bulky additions to the existing property and would therefore have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the host building, the surrounding area and in particular the streetscene of Woodside. The proposals are therefore considered to fail to comply with the principles of policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted SPP 2014, policy CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and D3, D4, D8 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 2 - There is inconsistency with the plans submitted and the proposed side elevations do not correspond with the proposed plans submitted.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
