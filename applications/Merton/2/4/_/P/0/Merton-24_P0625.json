    "Reason : 1 - The outbuilding, by reason of its combined siting and excessive scale would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to reflect the form and proportion of a typical outbuilding for ancillary use associated with the main dwellinghouse in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding.  The scheme is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) policy CS 14 of the London Borough of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate, with a lack of information being provided, that the development would comply with adopted planning policies and that the development would not have a harmful impact on the biodiversity value of the site and trees in conflict with Policy G7 of the London Plan, Policy CS13 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM O2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. . \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
