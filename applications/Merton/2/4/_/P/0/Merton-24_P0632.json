    "Condition : 4 - Construction Times - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE: \r\n\r\nLondon Borough of Merton requires a drainage channel across the full hard standing area which must drain to soft landscaping or a formulated soakaway for all vehicle crossover applications. The drainage channel must be installed between the Hard Standing and the council's footway where the hard standing slopes towards the highway and where an open granular surfacing has not been constructed as a finished surface. Block Paving, resin surfacing, Hard Rolled fine granular surfacing and all close bound semi-pervious solutions can all clog up over time and have increased the water runoff from private property. In acceptance of this and to comply with Sec 163. Highways Act 1980, all Vehicle crossover applications must be supported by a drainage channel. Where an extension to an existing crossover is requested the drainage channel must be for the new full width including any previously approved crossover. "
