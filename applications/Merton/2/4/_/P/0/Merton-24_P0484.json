    "Reason : 1 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason:\r\n\r\nThe proposed single storey rear extension is refused in accordance with Town and Country Planning (GPDO) 2015 (as amended) Class A, A.4(7) as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of adjoining neighbours is considered to be materially harmful and unacceptable. The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would result in unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of adjoining occupants at no. 8 Mount Road. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - Under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended), prior approval would be required and REFUSED for the following reason:\r\n\r\nThe scheme fails to comply with criteria A.4 (3) (b) of Class A Part 1 Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) as it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed rear extension will be sited wholly within the curtilage of the dwelling house known as 10 Mount Road, Mitcham, CR4 3EY"
