    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its height, scale, backland position and outlook would be harmful to neighbour amenity by causing overlooking and loss of privacy to the rear gardens of properties at 13 and 15 Amity Grove, and 34 Durham Road. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of its height, scale and backland position would be harmful to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - The proposed development would generate additional pressure on parking in the area, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing a car free agreement, the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport and active travel) and DM T3 (Car parking and\r\nservicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and Policies Plan (July 2014), Policy CS20 (Parking, servicing and delivery) of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and Policies T6 (Car Parking) and T6.1 (Residential Parking) of the London Plan (2021).",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
