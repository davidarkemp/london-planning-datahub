  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its backgarden siting, design, materials, height, bulk and mass results in a dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to relate to the pattern of development in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of unsatisfactory layout, absence of furniture layout and inadequate floor to ceiling height would result in a cramped and poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015. The proposals would fail to comply with policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of unacceptable siting, height and design, the proposed development results in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that will introduce new elevated views and thus would adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no 19 Love Lane by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of unacceptable siting, height and design, the proposed development results in an overbearing and visually intrusive form of development that will adversely impact on the residential amenity of the host dwelling in terms of loss of outlook and unreasonable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenities of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 21 Love Lane, contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - The scheme, by reason of the sub-standard refuse & recycling stores and cycle storage and absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a satisfactory arboricultural survey, arboricultural impact assessment, and arboricultural method statement, the proposal is considered to impact on the health and longevity of the existing on and off-site trees to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within, in particular, policy DM02 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
