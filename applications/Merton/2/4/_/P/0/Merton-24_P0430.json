    "Reason : 1 - The first floor extension to outbuilding, by reason of its combined siting, design, depth, bulk, mass, height, and roof form would result in a visually intrusive, incongruous, dominant, contrived and cramped form of overdevelopment that fails to enhance the character and appearance of the backland siting of the host property 217 Streatham Road, the row of terrace it belongs to and the Park Avenue Mews Streetscene to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is in conflict with, in particular, Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor extension to outbuilding by reason of its combined siting, height, depth, scale, form and design would result in a visually intrusive, overbearing and dominant form of development that would create a sense of enclosure, outlook and potential overlooking and loss of privacy to the detriment of the amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 217c   Streatham Road; Flat 2, 217 Streatham Road; 219 and 219a Streatham Road; Flats A, B and C 215 Streatham Road; No. 1,2 and 3 Park Avenue Mews.The proposal would be contrary, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D3, Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS14 and Policies DMD2 and DMD3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the unacceptable design and layout, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.   Overall, the proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy D6, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023, Merton Core Strategy CS14 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DM D2.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of a water usage statement and an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise water use as well as include measures in order to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral and provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that additional dwelling over and above the number of units currently on the site is prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies T3, T4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM T1, T2 and T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
