  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The single storey rear extension by reason of its combined unacceptable siting and depth would result in an incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that fails to respect the character and appearance of the host dwelling to the detriment of the visual amenity of the locality. The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a satisfactory parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall arising from the increase in occupancy on site, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on-street parking to the detriment of the free flow of traffic in the locality and highway and pedestrian safety and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to highway safety and sustainable transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
