    "Condition : 3 - Matching Materials - The facing materials used in the development hereby permitted shall match those of the existing building in materials, style, colour, texture and, in the case of brickwork, bonding, coursing and pointing.",
    "Condition : 4 - Construction Times - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 5 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n   ii) The application was approved without delay.\r\n\r\n",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE (Party Wall Act) - The applicant is advised to check the requirements of the Party Wall Act 1996 relating to work on an existing wall shared with another property, building on the boundary with a neighbouring property, or excavating near a neighbouring building.

    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant should be aware that the site may provide a useful habitat for swifts. Swifts are currently in decline in the UK and in order to encourage and improve the conservation of swifts the applicant is advised to consider the installation of swift nesting box/bricks on site.\r",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear mansard roof extension by reason of its design, appearance, bulk, massing and siting, would constitute an incongruous form of development that fails to achieve a high standard of design, out of character with the original building and the surrounding properties in Dunmore Road, to the detriment of visual amenity, the Dunmore Road street scene and the character and appearance of the Dunmore Road Conservation Area, contrary to planning policies DMD2 (Design considerations in all developments), DMD3 (Alterations and extensions to existing buildings) and DMD4 (managing heritage assets) of Merton's Sites Policies Plan (July 2014), policy CS14 (Design) of Merton's Core Strategy (2011) and policies D3 (Optimising site capacity through the design-led approach), D4 (Delivering good design) of the London Plan (2021), and the Dunmore Road Conservation Area Design Guide.",
