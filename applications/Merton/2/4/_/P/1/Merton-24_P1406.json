    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its combined design, height, siting, massing and form would result in an overly visually jarring, dominant, incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that fails to achieve a high standard of design that respects the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the attached semi-detached pair and general pattern of development in the area, contrary to, in particular, Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of its combined siting in close proximity to the common boundaries, design of windows on first floor side elevation, height and depth, results in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure, perceived overlooking and potentially impact on daylight/sunlight and cause overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, properties at no. 1 and 5 Birdhurst Road. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, policies DMD2 and DMD3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
