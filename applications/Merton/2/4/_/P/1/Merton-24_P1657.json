    "Condition : 1 - Commencement of development (Full Permission) - The development to which this permission relates shall be commenced not later than the expiration of 3 years from the date of this permission.",
    "Condition : 2 - Approved Plans - The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Flood Risk Statement; Fire Safety Statement; 001C; 012D; 010E; 011E; 013F. ",
    "Condition : 3 - Materials as Specified - The facing materials to be used for the development hereby permitted shall be those specified in the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 4 - No Use of Flat Roof  - Access to the flat roof of the development hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 5 - Construction Times - No demolition or construction work or ancillary activities such as deliveries shall take place before 8am or after 6pm Mondays - Fridays inclusive, before 8am or after 1pm on Saturdays or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.",
    "Condition : 6 - Obscured Glazing - Before the development hereby permitted is first occupied, the windows in the side elevations at top floor level shall be glazed with obscured glass and shall be maintained as such thereafter.",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n",
    "Condition : 8 - The Council as local planning authority, recognizes the importance of achieving high standards of site practice and workmanship in the course of construction and acknowledges that this will have significant influence upon the quality of the finished brickwork.\r\n\r\nThe applicant is therefore encouraged to follow the advice set out in the Brick Development Association publication: Good-Site-Practice-Workmanship-General-Guide-2023 when implementing the development hereby approved.",
    "Condition : 9 - Building Regulations \r\nPlease note that this is a planning permission only and you may also require approval under the Building Regulations. If you are in any doubt about this you can get further information via https://www.merton.gov.uk/planning-and-buildings/building-control  or by emailing building.control@merton.gov.uk.\r\n",
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed hip to gable roof extension together with the rear dormer window, by reason of its excessive height, mass and scale would create an excessively bulk roof form, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and the street scene. As such the proposal would fail to comply with Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Site and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
