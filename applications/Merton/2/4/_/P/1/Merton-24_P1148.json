    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIt is Council policy for the Council's contractor to construct new vehicular accesses. The applicant should contact the Council's Highways Team on 020 8545 3829 prior to any work starting to arrange for this work to be done. If the applicant wishes to undertake this work the Council will require a deposit and the applicant will need to cover all the Council's costs (including supervision of the works).

In respect of surface water it is recommended that the applicant should ensure that storm flows are attenuated or regulated into the receiving public network through on or off-site storage.  When it is proposed to connect to a combined public sewer, the site drainage should be separate and combined at the final manhole nearest the boundary.  Connections are not permitted for the removal of ground water.  Where the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required (contact no. 0845 850 2777).\r\n"
