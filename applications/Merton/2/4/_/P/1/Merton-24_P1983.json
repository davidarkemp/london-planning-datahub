    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of its combined unacceptable design, height, width, depth, siting, bulk and massing would result in an unsympathetic, incongruous, visually obtrusive, dominant and cramped form of overdevelopment of the site that fails to complement the setting, character and appearance of the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the host site and surrounding area. As such it would fail to comply with, in particular, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development by reason of its unacceptable combined design, height, depth, width, bulk and massing results in a visually intrusive, dominant and prominent form of overdevelopment that would also result in overlooking, loss of privacy and create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, particularly GF&FF Flats 1 Wilton Road, 23A&B and 25 Norfolk Road, Flat 1&2, 2 Harewood Road and 4 Harewood Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policy DM D1, DM D2 and DMD3, Core Strategy Policy CS 14 and London Plan policy D2, D3 and D4.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that new dwellings are prevented from being able to obtain parking permits for the Controlled Parking Zone, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T4, T6 of the London Plan, policy DM T1, DM T2 and DM T3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 4 - The proposal by reason of its siting and absence of a tree protection plan, arboricultural impact assessment, arboricultural method statement, the scheme results in an unsustainable form of development that could adversely impact on the health and longevity of existing street tree to the detriment of the ecological benefit, natural environment and visual amenity of the locality. The scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy G7, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS13 and Policies DMD2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",

The scheme fails to comply with the aims and objectives of, in particular, London Plan 2021 Policy G7, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS13 and Policies DMD2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of tree survey, arboricultural impact assessment, arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the proposal is considered to adversely impact on the health and longevity of nearby trees to the detriment of visual amenity of the locality and biodiversity in the Borough.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM D2 and DMO2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
