    "Condition : 5 - No Use of Flat Roof  - Access to the flat roof of the single storey extension hereby permitted shall be for maintenance or emergency purposes only, and the flat roof shall not be used as a roof garden, terrace, patio or similar amenity area.",
    "Condition : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\r\n   i) Offering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n   ii) Where possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n   iii) As appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\n   i) The application was acceptable as submitted and no further assistance was required.\r\n",
    "Condition : 7 - INFORMATIVE: If the hereby approved single storey rear and side infill extension is built as well as the outbuilding (confirmed as lawful) under Certificate of Lawfulness 24/P1619 is built and implemented, the total area of ground covered by buildings, enclosures and containers within the curtilage (other than the original dwellinghouse) would exceed 50% of the total area of the curtilage. As such, it would therefore exceed the limitations set out in the criteria of the GPDO under Class E. In this situation the\r\napplicant would therefore need to submit a planning application for the proposed outbuilding.\r\n"
