  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of satisfactory evidence to demonstrate the lack of demand for the continued use of the existing commercial use in employment generating and/or community uses, the loss of existing non-residential sites is considered contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policy E4 of the London Plan (2021), policies DM E3 and DM R4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Polices Plan (2014) and policies CS3 and CS12 of Core Strategy (2011).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposals by virtue of siting, design and layout would provide inadequate privacy and outlook resulting in a cramped and substandard living condition and environment to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme is contrary to London Plan Policies D3, D14 & SI 1, Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan policies DM D2, DM EP2 and DM EP4, Housing Design Standards London Plan Guidance 2023 standard C2.5 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard 2015. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2.\r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 4 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the additional parking demand, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on-street parking, resulting in a detrimental impact on highway and additional parking pressure locally and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and given the opportunity to submit amended plans in an effort to resolve officer concerns.  \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission although the proposal is fundamentally unacceptable.\r\n"
