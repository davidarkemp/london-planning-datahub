    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development is contrary to the Development Plan when considered as whole. In weighing up the planning harm and benefits of the proposed development, it is considered that the substantial weight given to the harm arising from loss of the public house, and its associated heritage, cultural, economic and social value, conflicts with Policy DM R5 g) i) of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy HC7 (A1 and B) of the London Plan 2021, and fails to be outweighed by other demonstrable planning benefits.",
    "Reason : 2 - The development site lies in Flood Zone 2 and the submitted SUDs strategy relates to a previous proposal. In the absence of up to date flood risk assessment and SuDs strategy, the proposal could have an unacceptable impacts on flooding on-site and elsewhere contrary to Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) Policies DMF1 and DMF2.   \r\n\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a signed legal agreement securing a permit free development, the development may result in undue additional pressure on parking in the area contrary to policies DM T1 (support for sustainable transport  and active travel), DM T3 (Car parking and servicing standards) of Merton's Adopted Sites and  Policies Plan (July 2014) and CS20 of Merton's Adopted Core Planning Strategy (July 2011).",
    "Reason : 4 - Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF. \r\n\"              The applicant was informed of the Council's decision to refuse the application prior to a decision being issued.  Given the level of public interest in the development, the level of substantial change required to make the proposed development acceptable, and the length of time elapsed since the Council's new Local Plan was adopted, it was considered appropriate to bring the application process to a close.  \r\n\"            Pursuant to reason number 3 above, it is noted the applicant were agreeable to signing a legal agreement securing permit free development. However, given the final decision to refuse, the legal agreement was not finalised. \r\n"
