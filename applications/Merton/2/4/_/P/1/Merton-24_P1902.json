  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The new dwelling contains a 3bed 3 person unit and fails to provide a double bedroom within a three bed unit and the proposals show undersized double bedrooms each measuring less than 11.5sqm proving a cramped internal amenity for future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policy D6 2) and 4) in particular of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015. ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal would result in the complete loss of the existing garden serving flat 96 Wide Way, leaving it with no external amenity space, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014. The siting of the proposed dwelling in close proximity to the front door of 84 Wide Way would severely restrict access, creating an unacceptable impact on the usability and accessibility of the property. Thereby failing to meet the requirements of Policy D5 of the London Plan 2021 and (INSERT)",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the schemes potential to remove on street parking spaces and absence of a parking survey following Lambeth Methodology to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the increased number of occupiers and loss of spaces, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of an agreement confirming self build exemption the proposal fails to meet the requirements of the Environment Act 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of absence of information to demonstrate net biodiversity gain through inclusion of ecological enhancements but the proposal fails to comply with Policy G6 of the London Plan and Merton Core Strategy 2011 CS13.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a construction level detailed scheme for the provision of surface and foul water drainage, including confirmation of run off rates of no more than 1L/s, the proposed development fails to demonstrate compliance with Merton's Core Strategy and Sites 2011 and Policies Plan 2014 policies CS16, DMF2 and the London Plan 2021 policy SI 12 and SI13. ",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant - Refused Schemes\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\n1. Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4. Determining applications in a timely manner including providing a fast track service, details to be found on Get a quicker planning decision on LBM's website.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\nThe applicants did not seek formal pre-application advice, and the scheme was found to be contrary to policy and guidance, and subsequently refused. The Council is ready to enter into formal pre-application discussions to advise the applicants of relevant policy and guidance; and where possible assist in the preparation of a new planning permission.\r\n"
