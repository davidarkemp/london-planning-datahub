    "Reason : 1 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, depth and design would result in a prominent, unsympathetic and incongruous form of overdevelopment that fails to respect the form, proportion of the host and the pattern of development in the locality. The scheme would be contrary to, in particular, the London Plan design policies D1, D4, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14.  ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, depth and height would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would adversely impact on the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 27  Glebe Avenue. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 policies DM D2, DM D3.  ",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
