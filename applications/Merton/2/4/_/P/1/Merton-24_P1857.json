The applicant should contact the Council's Highways Team on 020 8545 3829 prior to any work starting to arrange for this work to be done. If the applicant wishes to undertake this work the Council will require a deposit and the applicant will need to cover all the Council's costs (including supervision of the works).

    "Condition : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nX16 Crossover Drainage\r\nLondon Borough of Merton requires a drainage channel across the full hard standing area which must drain to soft landscaping or a formulated soakaway for all vehicle crossover applications. The  drainage channel must be installed between the Hard Standing and the councils footway where the hard standing slopes towards the highway and where an open granular surfacing has not been constructed as a finished surface. Block Paving, resin surfacing, Hard Rolled fine granular surfacing and all close bound semi-pervious solutions can all clog up over time and have increased the water runoff from private property. In acceptance of this and to comply with Sec 163. Highways Act 1980, all Vehicle crossover applications must be supported by a drainage channel. Where an extension to an existing crossover is requested the drainage channel must be for the new full width including any previously approved crossover.        "
