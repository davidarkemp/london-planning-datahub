The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its combined siting, height and depth would result in an overbearing, dominant and visually intrusive form of development that would create a sense of enclosure and potentially result in unacceptable overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular, no. 28 Turner Avenue. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014). \r\n",
