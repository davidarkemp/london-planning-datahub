    "Reason : 1 - The first floor side extension element of the proposal, by reason of its design, scale, bulk and location would; i) fail to respect the design, detailing, form, scale, bulk and proportions of the host dwelling and would ii) lose a visual gap and create a terracing effect that would fail to respect the space between buildings where it contributes to the suburban character of the area to the detriment of the visual amenity of the Arundel Avenue street scene. As such, the proposals would fail to accord with policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and policy CS 14 of the Merton Core Strategy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nOfficers note that the submitted drawings show discrepancies - the rear elevation drawing A600/P/112 does not show the first floor rear facing window and the Proposed First Floor Plan A600/P/100 Rev B does not show the first floor window to serve the office to the front elevation. Any resubmission should ensure that all drawings show the proposal consistently.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\n Note to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
