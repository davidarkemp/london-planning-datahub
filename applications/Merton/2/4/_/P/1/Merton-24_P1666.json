    "Reason : 1 - Due to the siting, layout and separate access to the outbuilding titled \"bedroom\" officers consider the outbuilding to be a self-contained unit (C3 use).  By reason of the unacceptable layout, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal by reason of undersized bedroom size, kitchen and private amenity space would create a poor standard of amenity for occupiers of the C4 HMO. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, polices DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, and policies CS 8, CS9 and CS14 within the Council's Adopted Core Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus failed to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 4 - The scheme, by reason of absence of refuse & recycling stores, the scheme would adversely impact on visual amenity of the locality and the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policies SI7, SI8, T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS14, CS17 and CS 19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 of the SPP 2014.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with, in particular, policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a Housing Management Plan, the proposal is in conflict with, in particular, Policy H16 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
