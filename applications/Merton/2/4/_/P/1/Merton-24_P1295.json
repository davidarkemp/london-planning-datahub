  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its design, height, siting, massing, form and materials would result in an overly dominant, incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that fails to achieve a high standard of design that respects the character and appearance of the host dwelling, Darley Gardens street scene and general pattern of development in the St Helier Estate and surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would result in a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers due to inadequate internal layout. The scheme would fail to provide an acceptable standard of residential accommodation and living space resulting in a cramped and unsatisfactory standard of accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposals would therefore be contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, London Plan 2021 policy D6, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015 The proposals would fail to comply with policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of insufficient private external amenity space and lack of justification as to why it cannot be provided, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future and existing occupiers.  The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015).",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of sufficient and satisfactory cycle parking provision, the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus failed to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy 2011. ",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Design, it has not been demonstrated the scheme would safeguard the risk of flooding in the locality.  The proposal is contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy SI 13, Merton Core Strategy (2011) policy CS16 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014) policies DM F1 and DM F2. ",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policies SI 1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 8 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain of 10% or any relevant exemptions. The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021).",
    "Reason : 9 - The proposal fails to demonstrate any sustainability measures including water consumption rates and therefore the proposed development has failed to meet the objectives of policies SI 2 and SI 5 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011)",
    "Reason : 10 - The proposed provision of x2 additional car parking spaces would result in an overprovision of car parking contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to reducing car usage and promoting more sustainable forms of transport and by reason of the loss of off-street parking provided by the garage and the absence of a parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2, T3 and T6 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS19 and 20 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 11 - In the absence of details of front boundary treatment and satisfactory replacement soft landscaping in the front garden the proposal is considered to result in increased visual permeability into a predominantly hard surfaced area to the detriment of visual amenity of the locality and biodiversity in the Borough.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies DM D2 and DMO2 of the Merton \nSites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 12 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
