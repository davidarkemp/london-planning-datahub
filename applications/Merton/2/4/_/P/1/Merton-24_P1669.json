    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its backgarden siting, design, roof form,  height, bulk and mass results in a dominant, incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that fails to relate to the pattern of development in the locality to the detriment of the visual amenity of the surrounding.  The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS 14 of the Core Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of insufficient private external amenity space and lack of justification as to why it cannot be provided, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The development would thereby be contrary to, in particular, policy DM D2 of Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014), policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (March 2015)",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of a completed S106 undertaking to ensure that the proposed development is a self-build, failing to demonstrate any management of potential impact on biodiversity The proposal therefore fails to comply with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of unacceptable siting, height and design, the proposed development results in a visually intrusive form of development that will adversely impact on the residential amenity of the host dwelling in terms of loss of outlook and unreasonable sense of enclosure to the harm of the occupiers, contrary to the aims and objections of, in particular, policy DM D2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014. ",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of a satisfactory parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall arising from the increase in occupancy on site, the proposal would result in an increased demand for on-street parking to the detriment of the free flow of traffic in the locality and highway and pedestrian safety and be contrary to the Mayor and the Council's commitment to highway safety and sustainable transport. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM T1, T2 and T3 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and Policy CS20 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011",
    "Reason : 6 - Due to the narrow width to access the proposed cycle parking the development has failed to provide sufficient secure, integrated, convenient and accessible cycle parking facilities and thus fail to promote sustainable form of transport, contrary to, in particular, policy DMT1 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and T5 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
