    "Reason : 1 - The proposal, by reason of its combined loss of front boundary treatment and insufficient depth to facilitate the creation of a front garden parking space would result in a unsafe form of development that would adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The proposal fails to demonstrate it would comply with the aims and objectives of: London Plan policies D1, D4 T6, SI13, Merton Core Planning Strategy policy CS14, CS18, CS20 and Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 DMD2, DM F1, DM F2, DM T2, DM T3, DM T5  ",
    "Reason : 2 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n"
