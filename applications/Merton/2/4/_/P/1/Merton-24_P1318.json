    "Reason : 1 - The proposed rear dormer roof extension by reason of its combined scale, massing, bulk, and width would fail to achieve a high standard of design, being out of keeping, unduly dominant and unsympathetic to the appearance, scale, bulk, proportions and character of the original building and the wider area contrary to policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy D12.1, D12.2, D12.3 and D12.4 of the Merton Local Plan (2024).",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of combined scale, massing and siting the single storey rear extension results in a visually obtrusive form of development that will create an unacceptable sense of enclosure and result in overshadowing to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular no.23 Cavendish Road. The scheme is contrary to in particular, Merton Local Plan (2024) D12.3 and D12.4.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant - Refused Schemes\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the National Planning Policy Framework, London Borough of Merton (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\n1. Providing a formal pre-application advice service, details to be found on Planning pre-application advice service on LBM's website\r\n2. Providing written policies and guidance, which is available to view on LBM's website.\r\n3. Where appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision.\r\n4. Determining applications in a timely manner including providing a fast track service, details to be found on Get a quicker planning decision on LBM's website.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\nThe applicants did not seek formal pre-application advice, and the scheme was found to be contrary to policy and guidance. The Council's recommendations for amendments were not followed, and therefore the application was subsequently refused. The Council is ready to enter into formal pre-application discussions to advise the applicants of relevant policy and guidance; and where possible assist in the preparation of a new planning permission.\r\n\r\n"
