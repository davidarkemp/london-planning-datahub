    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two storey structure by reason of its combined siting, design and height results in a dominant, prominent, unsympathetic, incongruous and visually intrusive form of development that fails to respect the open character of the locality contrary to, in particular, London Plan policy D3 and Merton Local Plan D12.3.",
    "Reason : 2 - By reason of absence of Transport Statement including a car park management strategy, the proposal is considered to impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan, Merton Local Plan policies T16.3 and T16.4. ",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of the proposals impacting in excess of 25sqm of on-site habitat and absence of provision of a minimum 10% gain in biodiversity from the development, the scheme fails to comply with the requirements set out in the Environment Act 2021. ",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of an Energy Statement demonstrating the scheme has maximised local renewable and low carbon electricity and/or heat generation, the scheme fails to provide a sustainable form of development contrary to the requirements set out in, in particular, Merton Local Plan Policy CC2.4",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of satisfactory evidence to justify the requirement of the additional building and demonstrate alternative locations have been explored, the scheme is considered to be an inappropriate development that would erode the quality of existing Open Space contrary to, in particular, Policies O15.1 and O15.2 of Merton Local Plan 2024 and London Plan 2021 Policy G4.   ",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a Fire Safety Strategy incorporating but not limited to a plan detailing appropriate positioning of fire appliances and appropriate evacuation assembly points the scheme fails to demonstrate that it would provide a safe form of development for future users contrary to, in particular, Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 7 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
