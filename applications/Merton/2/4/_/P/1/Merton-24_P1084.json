    "Reason : 1 - By reason of siting, layout, potential to create a separate planning unit, absence of drawings, including detailed floor plans and elevations, of the single storey outbuilding the council are unable to ascertain the impact of the outbuilding on the character and appearance of the host site or the surrounding area nor are they able to assess the impact on neighbour amenity and potential highways impact.  The proposal would fail to comply with, in particular, policies DMD2, DMD3, DM T1, DM T2 and DM T3 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014, CS 14 and CS20 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and Policy T6, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021. ",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of confirmation of the retention of the existing front boundary wall, the scheme would increase visual permeability into a predominately hard surfaced forecourt which fails to positively contribute to the visual amenity of the streetscene contrary to, in particular, DMD2 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 3 - By reason of absence of cycle storage, the scheme fails to promote sustainable form of travel, contrary to the aims and objectives set out in, in particular, London Plan Policies T5 and T6.1 and Merton Core Strategy (2011) Policy CS18.",
    "Reason : 4 - By reason of absence of satisfactory refuse provision, the scheme is considered to adversely impact on the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of highway and pedestrian safety. Therefore the proposal fails to comply with, in particular, policy SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and CS17 of Merton's Core Strategy Policy",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of sufficient information confirming which occupiers would have access to the lounge at roof level, the council are unable to ascertain the impact on the amenities of future occupiers. It is therefore concluded that the proposal would fail to comply with the principles of policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DMD2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a satisfactory Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would be at minimum air quality neutral, not worsening local air quality thereby failing to comply with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021",
    "Reason : 7 - The application has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would secure a net biodiversity gain, contrary to, in accordance, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021, policy CS13 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011 and policy DM 02 of Merton's Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE:\r\nThe existing outbuilding and fencing is considered to be unauthorised and could result in enforcement action"
