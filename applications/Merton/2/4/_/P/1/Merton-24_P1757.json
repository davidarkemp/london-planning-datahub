    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development due to a combination of its excessive height, depth, siting and design would be overbearing and visually intrusive to the detriment of the occupiers of No. 28 Prince's Road, contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed first floor rear extension would be an incongruous addition which is out of character with surrounding properties and would fail to preserve or enhance the Merton (South Park Gardens) Conservation Area contrary to policies CS.14 of the Core Planning Strategy (2011) and DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).

LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
