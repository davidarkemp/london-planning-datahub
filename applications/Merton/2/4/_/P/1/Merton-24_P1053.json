    "Reason : 1 - In the absence of details of replacement windows, Officers are unable to ascertain whether the replacement windows would preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the host building, Commonside East streetscene or whether it would preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area. This would amount to less than substantial harm to the heritage asset for which there is no outweighing public benefit. As such it would fail to comply with, in particular, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, DM D2, DM D3 and DM D4 of the Adopted Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and CS14 of the LBM Core Strategy 2011 and the Mitcham Cricket Green Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan.\r\n",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Heritage Statement describing the significance and impact of the Mitcham Cricket Green conservation area, the scheme fails to demonstrate it would preserve or enhance the setting, character and appearance of the Mitcham Cricket Green conservation area contrary to paragraph 207 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024.\r\n",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
