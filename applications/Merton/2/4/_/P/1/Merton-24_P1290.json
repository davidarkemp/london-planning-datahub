  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development, by reason of its combined rear garden siting, height, depth, width and footprint results in an incongruous and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment that fails to reflect the scale of typical outbuildings in the locality to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host site and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to, in particular, policy CS14 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy (2011) and policy DMD2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposal, by reason of poor outlook, lack of passive ventilation and insufficient direct sunlight into the habitable rooms, the scheme represents over-intensification and over-development of the site that would result in sub-standard living conditions and environment, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, CS 14 in the Merton Core Strategy 2011, Policy DM D2 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan 2014 and DCLG Technical Housing Standards -nationally described space standard 2015.",
    "Reason : 3 - The site is within an area of an area at risk of surface water flooding. In the absence of a suitable Flood Risk Assessment incorporating drainage strategy and information on surface water flooding impacts, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of flooding and surface water runoff, contrary to, in particular Policies SI 13 and D10 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS 16 of the Core Planning Strategy 2011 and Policies DM D2 and DM F2 of the Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 4 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, the proposal does not include measures to make the proposal Air Quality Neutral nor does the proposal include provisions to achieve sustainable design and construction. The proposal therefore fails to comply with, in particular, policies SI 1, SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of onsite parking for the new unit and absence of parking survey to demonstrate there is capacity in the locality to accommodate the parking shortfall, the scheme would adversely impact on parking, the free flow of traffic in the locality to the detriment of pedestrian and vehicular safety on the surrounding roads.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, Policy T6 of the London Plan and Policy CS.19 of the Merton Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of a refuse strategy and adequate refuse and recycling storage facilities for the development, the applicant has not demonstrated that the scheme would provide adequate refuse storage and facilities to the detriment of the free flow of traffic and visual amenity of the locality. The scheme is contrary to, in particular, Policies D4, SI 7 & SI 8 of the London Plan 2021,  Merton Core Strategy 2011 policies CS14 & CS17 and Policies DM D2, DM T2, DM T3 of Mertons Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a soft-landscaping scheme and measures to improve biodiversity measures the scheme fails to enhance biodiversity and ecological enhancements thereby failing to comply the objectives set out in, in particular, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM O2 of Mertons Sites and Policies Plan 2014.",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a Tree Survey, Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, the scheme fails to demonstrate the works can co-exist sustainably with all off-site trees and safeguard the health and longevity of the existing trees to the detriment of the visual amenity, biodiversity and ecological value of the locality and would fail to achieve the objectives set out within, in particular, policy DMO2 Merton Sites and Policies Plan July 2014",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of required cycle parking spaces, the proposal fails to promote sustainable form of travel contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, policies Core Strategy Policy CS18 and London Plan Policy T5.",
    "Reason : 10 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 11 - INFORMATIVE\r\nThe applicant is informed that only works sited within the red line site location plan have been considered.\r\n"
