  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The application presents conflicting and unclear information as to the number of C3 residential units proposed. In the absence of clear information submitted the application would fall contrary to Merton Strategic Policy H11.2 Housing Provision (e), as it is unclear whether there is a sufficient number of new units to replace the existing units to be demolished. ",
    "Reason : 2 - There is a lack of clarity in respect of the exact number of C3 units and accordingly, Officers are unable to conclude with any confidence that the housing mix is acceptable contrary to London Plan policy H10 and Local Plan policy H11.3",
    "Reason : 3 - Some C3 units would have substandard outlook and would be single aspect. Furthermore, no details have been provided in respect of the aparthotel use such as communal facilities, and no evidence has been submitted to demonstrate how C1 and C3 uses would operate side by side in a safe and secure fashion. The proposal would result in a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Local Plan policy D12.3.",
    "Reason : 4 - Insufficient information provided with the application to demonstrate the proposal would be designed and delivered for those with disabilities contrary to London Plan policy D7 and Merton Local Plan policy D12.3. ",
    "Reason : 5 - The scale and form of the building would be excessive and unduly prominent when viewed from the rear of terrace properties on The Path and in relation to 30 Morden Road contrary to London Plan policy D3, D8, and Merton SPP policy D12.3 respect of visual impact, character and appearance.",
    "Reason : 6 - The proposal would have a harmful impact on the amenity of nos. 2,2a,4 and 4a the Path, and no. 30 Morden Road by way impacts on outlook, daylight and unlight contrary to NPPF para 135 and Local Plan policy Merton Local Plan policy. ",
    "Reason : 7 - There is a lack of clarity on the number parking spaces for the C1 and C3 and no justification has been provided for the number of spaces provided contrary to London Plan Policy T6.1 and T6.4.",
    "Reason : 8 - In the absence of a legal agreement securing permit free development, the proposal could have an adverse impact on the local parking network contrary to Local Plan policy T16.4.",
    "Reason : 9 - In the absence of supporting technical information, namely a swept path analysis, transport statement and due to the height of the undercroft, the proposal would provide insufficient servicing arrangements contrary to NPPF para 112, London Plan Policy T7 (G) and Local Plan policy T16.3.",
    "Reason : 10 - No transport assessment or statement has been submitted alongside the application. Therefore, there is little evidence to demonstrate the transport impacts of the development on the network e.g. the number of trips by different modes for the aparthotel. In the absence of such evidence, the proposal is contrary to NPPF para 111 and Local Plan policy T16.3.",
    "Reason : 11 - No supporting information, such as an outline energy assessment, has been submitted to demonstrate the proposal would meet the necessary carbon minimization contrary to London Plan policy SI2 and Local Plan policy CC2.2.\r\nOfficers note no UGF assessment has been submitted with the application and in the absence of this, the proposal would fall contrary to London Plan policy G5 and Local Plan policy O15.5.\r\n.",
    "Reason : 12 - Officers note no UGF assessment has been submitted with the application and in the absence of this, the proposal would fall contrary to London Plan policy G5 and Local Plan policy O15.5.",
    "Reason : 13 - No flood risk assessment has been submitted alongside the application nor has any details in respect of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDs) to demonstrate the proposal is policy compliant. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with London Plan policies SI12, SI13, and Local Plan policies F15.7, F15.8, and F15.9. ",
    "Reason : 14 - Officers note that no air quality neutral assessment has been submitted alongside the application. Therefore, in the absence of suitable evidence the proposal is considered contrary to London Plan policy SI1 and local Plan policy P15.10.",
    "Reason : 15 - No fire safety strategy has been submitted alongside the application. Furthermore the building is over 19 meters whilst the latest Fire Safety LPG produced by the mayor requires two stair cores for buildings over 18 meters. For these reasons, the proposal is contrary to London Plan policy D12. ",
    "Reason : 16 - The proposal would result in significant harm to non-designated heritage asset in the form of the existing buildings. This harm is not outweighed by benefits of the scheme and as such their demolition is not acceptable in view of NPPF para 203.",
    "Reason : 17 - In the absence of evidence and information on affordable housing, and in the absence of a legal agreement securing affordable housing, the proposal would fail to comply with London Plan policy H5 and Local Plan policy H11.1.",
    "Reason : 18 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe application was considered to be fundamentally contrary to the provisions of the Development Plan and the NPPF, and there were not considered to be any solutions to resolve this conflict. \r\n\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
