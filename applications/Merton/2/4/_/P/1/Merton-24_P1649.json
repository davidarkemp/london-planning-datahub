    "Reason : 1 - The two storey side and front extensions by reason of its design, siting, massing and form would result in an overly dominant, incongruous, visually intrusive and unsympathetic form of development that fails to achieve a high standard of design that respects the character and appearance of the host dwelling, Beeleigh street scene and general pattern of development in the area, contrary to Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS 14 of the Merton LDF Core Planning Strategy (2011) and Policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Merton Sites and Policies Plan (2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed two storey side and front extensions by reason of its combined siting, height and massing would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenity of nearby occupants, in particular 39 and 39a Bardney Road. The proposal would therefore be contrary to, in particular, Merton's Sites and Policies Plan policy DMD2.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
