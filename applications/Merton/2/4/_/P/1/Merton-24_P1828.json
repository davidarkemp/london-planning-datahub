    "Reason : 1 - The proposed two and single storey rear extensions, two storey side extension roof works, windows and doors and wall finish treatment, by reason of their combined massing and design would result in a prominent, visually intrusive, unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to relate to the character and appearance of the host building, surrounding street scene and area in general. The scheme would be contrary to the London Plan design policies D1, D4, SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3, and Merton Core Strategy 2011 policy CS 14 ",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed single storey rear extension and raised patio, by reason of height, depth, proximity to the boundary and lack of boundary screening would result in material harm to the amenities of the occupiers of no.4 Edward Avenue, by way of loss of light, visual intrusion, sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and loss of privacy. The scheme would be contrary to the SPP Policies DMD2 and DMD3.",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
