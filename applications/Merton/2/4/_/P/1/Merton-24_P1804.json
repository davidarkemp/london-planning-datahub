    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by virtue of its height, depth, siting and design would be visually intrusive, overbearing and result in an unacceptable loss of outlook to the detriment of occupiers of No. 14 Compton Road. In addition, the proposed development by virtue of its height, siting and depth would result in overlooking to the detriment of neighbouring occupiers at properties on Alexandra Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies DM D2 and DM D3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 2 - The proposed development would result in 3 additional residential units, the site is located in a controlled parking zone, has excellent access to public transport and there is no legal agreement in place for the units to be permit free, contrary to the requirements of policy CS. 20 of the Core Planning Strategy (July 2011) and DM T3 of the Adopted Sites and Policies Plan and Policies Maps (July 2014).",
    "Reason : 3 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n"
