  "decision_conditions": [
    "Reason : 1 - The proposed development by reason of design, detailing, materials, siting, form, footprint, height, absence of accurate drawings and use justification would fail to achieve a high standard of design, resulting in visual clutter that would adversely impact on the open character of the Open Space and the locality contrary to London Plan G4, Merton Local Plan (2024) Policies D12.3, O15.1 and O15.2.",
    "Reason : 2 - In the absence of a Transport Statement, the including a car park management strategy, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the scheme will not result in harm to the free flow of traffic in the locality and thus has the potential to adversely impact on highway and pedestrian safety.  The scheme fails to comply with, in particular, policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan, Merton Local Plan policies T16.3 and T16.4. ",
    "Reason : 3 - In the absence of an Air Quality Neutral Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would be Air Quality Neutral, contrary to policies SI 1,SI 2, SI 5 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy CS15 of Merton's Core Planning Strategy 2011.",
    "Reason : 4 - The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development incorporates urban greening measures and fails to provide a minimum 10% net gain in biodiversity, contrary to London Plan policies G5 and G6, Merton Local Plan Policies O15.3, O15.5 and requirements set out in the Environment Act 2021.",
    "Reason : 5 - In the absence of tree survey, arboricultural impact assessment, arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposals would not adversely impact on the health and longevity of nearby trees to the detriment of visual amenity of the locality and biodiversity in the Borough.  The scheme is contrary to the aims and objectives of, in particular, Merton Policies O15.4 and D12.2 of Merton's Local Plan 2024-3037/38.",
    "Reason : 6 - In the absence of an Energy Statement, the applicant has failed to demonstrate how the proposals have made the fullest contribution to supplying energy efficiently and cleanly, and maximising renewable and low carbon energy generation, storage and use, through the deployment of appropriately selected, sized and sited technologies, contrary to the planning policy CC2.4 of Merton's Local Plan 2024 - 2037/38.",
    "Reason : 7 - In the absence of a Fire Safety Strategy, the applicant has failed to demonstrate fire safety measures contrary to Merton's Validation Checklist and Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Reason : 8 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 38 of the NPPF, The London Borough of Merton  (LBM) takes a positive and proactive approach to development proposals focused on solutions. LBM works with applicants/agents in a positive and proactive manner by:\r\n\"\tOffering a pre-application advice and duty desk service. \r\n\"\tWhere possible, suggesting solutions to secure a successful outcome.\r\n\"\tAs appropriate, updating applicants/agents of any issues that may arise in the processing of their application.\r\nIn this instance:\r\n\"\tThe application was not considered to comply with the provisions of the Development Plan and NPPF as submitted, and would have required substantial changes such that a new application would be required. \r\n\"\tThe applicant/agent was informed of any issues arising during consideration of the application and how these could potentially be overcome but sufficient information was not forthcoming. \r\n\"\tIt is noted that the applicant/agent did not engage in any pre-application discussions.\r\n\"\tThe applicant is advised to seek pre-application advice on any resubmission.\r\n",
    "Reason : 9 - INFORMATIVE\r\nNote to Applicant\r\nThe applicant is informed that an accurate set of drawings detailing plans and elevaitons are required in any future submissions. "
