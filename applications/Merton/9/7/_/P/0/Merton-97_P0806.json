    "Condition : 29 - The siting, bulk and massing of the development would fail to preserve or enhance the open character of the adjoining Conservation Area, and Metropolitan open Land, contrary to Policies EN1 and EB2 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (April 1996).",
    "Condition : 30 - The proposed development would have a substandard access arrangement at the junction of Coombe Lane and Cambridge Road and would therefore be prejudicial to highway safety and the free flow of traffic, contrary to Policy M12 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan (April 1996)."
