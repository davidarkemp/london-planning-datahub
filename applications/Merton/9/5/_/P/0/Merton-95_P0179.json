    "Condition : 1 - The development to which this permission relates must be begun not later than the expiration of 5 years, beginning with the date of this permission.  Reason for condition: To comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Condition : 3 - The floors and walls between each of the proposed residential flat units and ground floor commercial premises and adjacent buildings shall be so adapted as to achieve a reasonable resistance to airbourne sound and, where relevant, impact sound as far as is practical having regard to the existing construction. The insulation shall be in accordance with a scheme previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of works.  Reason for condition: To ensure a satisfactory standard of residential amenity.",
    "Condition : 4 - Two of the four proposed car parking spaces shown on the approved drawing No. 63-A-01 shall only be used by the occupiers of the two residential units in conjunction with the development hereby permitted.
