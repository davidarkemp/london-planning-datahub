    "Condition : 1 - The proposal represents an overdevelopment of this restricted site which would result in an unsatisfactory and cramped form of development lacking private amenity space and off-street parking facilities, contrary to Policies M.19 and H.14 of the U.D.P. Pre-Deposit Draft.",
    "Condition : 2 - The proposed development fails to reflect the character of the adjoining terraced properties and would be obtrusive in the street scene and detrimental to the visual amenities of the locality, contrary to Policy E.30 of the U.D.P Pre-Deposit Draft.",
    "Condition : 3 - The loss of the existing off-street parking for No. 2 Lyveden Road and the failure to provide any off-street parking facilities for the existing and proposed dwelling houses would lead to an increase in kerbside parking in the area to the detriment of highway safety and the amenities of the neighbouring residents, contrary to Policy M.19 of the UDP Pre-Deposit Draft."
