    "Condition : 1 - The trees shown on the deposited plan as to be retained shall be retained and maintained to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Condition : 2 - No preparatory works, site clearance or building operations shall commence until the trees referred to in Condition have been adequately protected by fencing or other suitable means of enclosure to a height of not less than 1.2 m and at a radius from the trunk as specified in BS5837 1991 Guide for Trees in relation to Construction (ie at the edge of the tree canopy or at a distance which is half the height of the tree (whichever is the greater)), unless otherwise agreed with the Local Authority. Such fencing shall be inspected and approved as acceptable by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of works and maintained until the conclusion of all site and building operations.  Reason for condition: To ensure that the existing trees are not damaged or otherwise adversely affected during all site operations, and to preserve and maintain the visual amenities and character of the locality.",
    "Condition : 3 - Any tree shown for retention, which is identified as being dead, dying, dangerous or mutilated, within three years from the completion of building works, thereby needing to be removed, shall be replaced by a semi-mature or mature tree of the same species or a tree of height, girth and species to be agreed with the Local Planning Authority. The replanting shall take place in the first available planting season.  Reason for condition: To preserve and maintain the visual amenities and character of the locality.",
    "Condition : 4 - During the period of building operations, the area within the protective fencing shall not be disturbed unless otherwise agreed by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason for condition: To preserve and maintain the visual amenities of the locality.",
    "Condition : 5 - During the construction period, no works shall be carried out to the trees to be retained referred to in Condition without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority. A copy of this approval must be displayed in a public location adjacent to the site whilst the tree surgery is in progress and remain in place until one week after the work has been completed. If accidental damage to protected trees occurs during the construction period, the developer will carry out remedial works as specified by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason for condition: To ensure that the trees are not damaged during the period of construction and their contribution to the amenity of the area is maintained.",
    "Condition : 6 - All new tree, shrub and ground cover planting shall be carried out during the first planting season after the completion of building operations on the site or within such longer period as may be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority, and such planting shall be maintained, including the replacement of dead, dying or defective plants and trees, to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority for a period of three years unless otherwise agreed.  Reason for condition: To preserve and maintain the visual amenities and character of the locality.",
    "Condition : 7 - The period of this consent shall expire 5 years from the date of this notice.",
    "Condition : 8 - The projecting box sign hereby consented to shall be displayed at fascia level."
