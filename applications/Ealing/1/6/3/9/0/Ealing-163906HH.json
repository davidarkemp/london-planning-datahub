    "The proposed part single part two-storey rear extensions, by reason of their scale/proportions and design in relation to the host building would result in an excessive alteration of this modest semidetached property which is out of keeping with the character and appearance of the established pattern of development in the vicinity. It is therefore considered that the proposed extensions would constitute an obtrusive overdevelopment of the host building, which would have a detrimental effect upon the visual amenity of the locality, contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, regional policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Document (2013) and policies 1.1, 1.2, 3.1 and 3.8 of the Ealing's Development Strategy. | The proposed part single part two-storey rear extensions, by reason of their scale/ proportions, siting  and relationship with the adjacent properties would result in an excessive and unneighbourly form of development that would have a detrimental impact on the residential amenities currently enjoyed by the occupiers of neighbouring property, due to loss of outlook, sense of enclosure and the overbearing effect of the proposed extensions, contrary to contrary to section 7 and 8 of the National Planning Policy Framework, regional policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Document (2013)and policies 1.1, 1.2, 3.1 and 3.8 of the Ealing's Development Strategy."
