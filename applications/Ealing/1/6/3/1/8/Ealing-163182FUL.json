    "The proposed mansard and outrigger roof extension, by reason of design, height, scale, bulk and prominence would appear as an incongruous overdevelopment of the site, out of keeping with the character and scale of the host building and adjacent properties, would result in a negative visual impact on character and appearance of property and would fail to preserve or enhance the Mill Hill Road Conservation Area.  As such the proposal is contrary to polices 7.4, 7B & 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (Consolidated 2015), the London Plan Supplementary Planning Guidance and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012) and policies 1.1 (g) (h), 1.2 (g) and 2.1 (c) of the adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012)"
