    "The proposal would represent an overdevelopment by virtue of its height, scale and massing would cause unacceptable impact on the amenity space of neighbouring properties. Future more the proposed buildings would create an undue sense of enclosure and overshadowing on the neighbouring properties.  As such the proposal would be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015 and policies LV 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013. | The proposed vehicle parking layout would not be sufficently sized to enable vehicles to access and agress in a safe manner, to the detriment of the pedestrian and vehicular safety. As such the proposed development does not comply with policies 6.9 and 6.13 of the London Plan (2015) (and local variation policy 6.13 of the Ealing Development Management DPD)."
