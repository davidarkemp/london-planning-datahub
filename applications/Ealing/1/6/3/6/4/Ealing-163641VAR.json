    "The amendments are not considered to meet Council's criteria for \"minor material\" amendments as the additional two bedroom unit would significantly amend the proposed development and the proposed roof terraces could potentially introduce additional amenity impacts. Therefore the proposal does not represent a \"minor material\" change from the original planning permission with regard to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). It is recommended that the the proposals would require submission of a new full planning application."
