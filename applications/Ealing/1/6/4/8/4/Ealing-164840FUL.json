    "C) Prior to the final completion of the non-residential unit contained within the development, the approved spaces shall incorporate and maintain measures to achieve an overall reduction in regulated CO2 emissions of at least 3.43% (equal to 0.18 tonnesCO2/yr) beyond Building Regulations Part L 2013 through the following carbon emission savings as detailed in the approved Energy Strategy Report (23 January 2018) and supplementary information (28 November 2017 & 18 January 2018) prepared by Price and Myers:",
    "i.\tPassive design measures to achieve to achieve at least annual carbon dioxide emission savings of 0.06 tonnes CO2 equating to 1.13% in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the compliant BR Part L 2013 base case.",
    "ii.\timproved energy saving measures to achieve at least annual carbon dioxide emission savings of 0.12 tonnes CO2 equating to 2.3% in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the Be Lean case",
    "D) Measures to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions associated with other energy uses not covered by Building Regulations (un-regulated) shall be shall be in accordance with the approved Energy Strategy Report (23 January 2018) and supplementary information (28 November 2017 & 18 January 2018) prepared by Price and Myers.",
    "The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved.",
    "Reason:  To ensure that the non-residential unit within the development hereby approved is energy efficient and to contribute to the avoidance of need for new fossil fuel or other primary energy generation capacity and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality in the interests of health, in accordance with policies 3.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.14 of the London Plan 2016, policies 1.1(e), 1.1(j), 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of Ealing's adopted Development (or Core) Strategy 2012, policies LV5.2 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD, and the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG."
