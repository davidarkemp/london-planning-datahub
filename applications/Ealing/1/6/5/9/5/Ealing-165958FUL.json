    "Reason: To secure the protection, throughout the time that the development is being carried out, of trees growing within or adjacent to the site which are of amenity value to the area in accordance with policy 5.10 of the Adopted Development Management Plan and 7.21 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "| Prior to the commencement of works (excluding demolition, site clearance and preparation works), the following detailed information shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval:",
    "a) An intrusive contaminated land investigation and risk assessment of the site, carried out in accordance with BS1075:2011+A1:2013 and CR11 guidance, to assess the nature and extent of any contamination on the site. This assessment must be undertaken by a competent person and shall assess any contamination on the site.",
    "b) A contamination remediation scheme to bring the relevant parts of the site to a condition suitable for the intended end use. The scope of the remediation scheme shall include details of all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, a timetable of works and site management procedures. The remediation scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation.",
    "Within six-months of the completion of measures identified in the approved contamination remediation scheme, a verification report (in accordance with the Environment Agency guidance 'Verification of Remediation of Land Contamination', Report: SC030114/R1') that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval.",
    "Reason: Further investigations of the presence of soil contamination within the application site and details of the methods for remediation are required before the commencement of building works in order to ensure that human health and the environment are protected, and to ensure the development activities do not activate or spread contamination in accordance with policies LV5.21 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013), Policy 5.21 of the London Plan 2016, and the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG."
