    "The proposed introduction of D1 floor space for a children's day nursery represents the loss of an A1 retail unit within a Primary Designated Shop. The proposal would therefore erode the function and viability of the surrounding retail area and is therefore contrary to policy 4B (retail) of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document and policy 4.8 of the London Plan (2015). | The proposed ground floor addition at the rear of No. 510 Lady Margaret Road, by reason of design, scale, siting and appearance , would fail to be seen as a subservient addition to the terrace building and would not complement the character and appearance of the property and its wider setting. As such, the rear addition would harm the visual amenity of neighbouring properties and conflicts with policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015). | The proposed children's day nursery would be positioned within retail units that are commercial in character, which contain shopfronts that are designed for public use. The proposed children's day nursery would therefore fail to provide adequate levels of privacy and distinction between public and private spaces. Moreover, the proposed rear playing area would adjoin vehicular servicing areas for adjoining shops and is itherefore not considered suitable for providing playing area for children between the ages of two and five years old. The proposed development would therefore be positioned within commercial premises that are not designed or suited for childcare facilities and would therefore not offer desirable and safe caring environment for young children. As such, the proposed change of use is not consistent with policy 3.18 of the London Plan (2015) and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
