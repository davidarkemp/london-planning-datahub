    "The proposed roof extension by reason of its scale, bulk and massing would constitute an incongruous overdevelopment that would fail to appear subordinate to the original dwelling.  It would constitute a dominant and obtrusive addition within the roofspace, detrimental to the character and appearance of the dwelling and would affect the visual amenity of the locality as a whole.  As such, it is considered the proposed extension would be contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan, policies 1.1 (g) and (h) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy, policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and the advice contained in the interim Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2004) and is therefore recommended for refusal."
