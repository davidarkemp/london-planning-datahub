    "The proposed beauty salon on the rear garden space of the residential terrace house would harm the residential amenities of neighbouring properties in terms of general disturbance and noise generation, which would result from excessive comings and goings to the rear of the dwelling house. Moreover, the proposed sui generis use on this location would affect the privacy of neighbouring properties and residents of the host dwelling house, by reason of inadequate access and unclear distinction between public and private spaces. As such, the development would be contrary to Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6 (2015). | The proposed beauty salon (sui generis use class) requires an active street frontage and is an activity that should be exposed from the street. The existing residential outbuilding on the rear garden is not designed for public use and the development therefore fails to incorporate appropriate principles of contextual design, in that the proposed development would not follow an established pattern of development within the surrounding setting. As such, the development is not consistent with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015) and policies ELV 7.4 , 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
