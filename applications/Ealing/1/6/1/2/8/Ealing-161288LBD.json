    "Reason: To comply with the provisions of Section 18(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, as amended, to prevent the accumulation of unimplemented listed building consents and to enable the Local Planning Authority to review the situation at the end of this period if the development has not begun. The development is permitted as enabling development to support the restoration and conversion of a grade II listed building, a heritage asset. The heritage asset, whilst presently capable of beneficial conversion, is in a declining state of repair and the Local Planning Authority considers it appropriate to reduce the time period for the implementation of the permission and the associated listed building consent to secure the objective of the restoration of the listed building at the earliest opportunity and, if the permission(s) are not implemented, to provide an opportunity to review the permission to ensure that the case for the enabling development remains valid.",
