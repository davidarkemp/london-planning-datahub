    "The proposed two storey side extension and part single part two storey rear extension by reason of scale, bulk and visual impact will be out of keeping with the neighbourhood and be an unacceptable disruption to the building pattern of the of the pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses. Furthermore, the proposal is considered to represent an overdevelopment of the property and would additionally impact on the amenities of the neighbouring property at No. 2 Bentley Close. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan - Consolidated 2015, Policies 1.1, 2.1 and 2.10 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy 2012; and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Development Management, Development Plan Document (2013)."
