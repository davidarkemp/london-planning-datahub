  "description": "Front right (nearest the road)\nT1\tFalse Acacia x 1\t\t\nLarge, mature, recently reduced tree. This tree has filled out quite rapidly since the reduction. In order to create a more open canopy, the suggested works are: To remove up to 50% of fine internal growth, remove overlong regrowth whilst retaining shorter growth for crown continuity, remove trunk growth.\nFront left (nearest the house)\nT2\tFalse Acacia x 1\nLarge, mature, recently reduced tree. This tree has also filled out quickly since being pruned. The suggested works are: To remove trunk growth only.\nRear right\nT3\tLaurel x 1\t\t\nLarge, dense and widespreading. To maximise light and control spread, the suggested works are: To reduce the height and the lateral spread all round by 1.5-2m.\nRear right\nT4\tPittosporum x 1\t\t\nLarge, multi stemmed tree. To maximise the light and to reduce the mechanical loading on the main unions, the suggested works are: To reduce the overall height by 2.5m, reduce the lateral spread all round by up to 1.5m to shape, remove deadwood.\nRear left\nT5\tOlive x 1\t\t\nThis tree is rapidly outgrowing its location. The suggested works are: To reduce the height by 3.5m, reduce the lateral spread by 1-1.5m to shape.",
