    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk, siting, and roof profiles would result in an unneighbourly and overbearing development that fails to respect the architectural integrity of the original dwelling, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the street scene and would harm the residential amenity of No. 61 Ferrymead Gardens, Greenford.  As such the proposal would be contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 of the London Plan (2015), and Interim Planning Guidance SPD4."
