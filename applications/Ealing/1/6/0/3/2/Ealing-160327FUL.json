    "The proposed development, by virtue of its height, bulk and scale in close proximity to No. 147 Noel Road, would result in unacceptable overbearingness and sense of enclosure to the residential amenity currently enjoyed by occupiers of neighbouring residential properties, contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 3.5,  7.4 and 7.6  of the London Plan (2015), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed development, by virtue of its design, appearance and scale, would be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area and as such would constitute an inappropriate form of development. The proposal would fail to preserve the character of the area and would therefore be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2015), policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012)."
