    "The proposed residential development by reason of its forward siting of the ground floor front elevation in context with existing development in the area, would be out of character with surrounding buildings and would be out of keeping with the pattern of development in the area, resulting in the undesirable development of the site and unacceptable impact on the visual and residential character of the locality, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015) and guidance contained within section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | The proposed development would fail to achieve suitable useable private residential amenity space, due to a combination of its width and associated boundary treatment resulting in a sense of enclosure to users. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015) and  policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), and guidance contained within section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
