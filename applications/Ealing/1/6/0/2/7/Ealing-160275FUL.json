    "The proposed flats, by reason of their substandard size; inadequate layout to make provision for refuse, recycling and cycle parking would result in substandard amenity and living conditions for future occupants. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Section 7, policy 3.5, 6.3, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, Housing SPG 2016, GLA and policies 1.1 (f), (g) and 1.2 Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2026 and Ealing local variation to London Plan policies 3.4, 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and SPG4 - Refuse and Recycling Facilities and Ealing's Sustainable Transport SPD. | The proposed first floor rear extension in conjunction with the roof terrace would have a detrimental impact on the residential amenity of this neighbouring property (no.108 Fordhook Road) due to the height and siting along the shared boundary, resulting in loss of outlook and privacy, an overbearing impact and unneighbourly sense of enclosure on the rear window and would result in loss of privacy arising from the replacement rear terrace contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016; policies LV 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development DPD 2013; and Interim Planning Guidance SPD 4 Residential Extensions. | The proposed roof extension by reason of its siting, scale and appearance would be out of keeping with the pair of semi-detached properties and established building pattern in the locality. As such the proposal is inconsistent with the aims of the London Plan (2015) policies 7.4 and 7.6, the Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B, and Interim SPD 4 - Residential Extensions."
