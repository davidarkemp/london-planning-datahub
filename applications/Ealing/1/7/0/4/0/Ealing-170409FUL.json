    "The proposed change of use from a residential garage (Use Class C3) to a Beauty Salon (Sui Generis) is considered detrimental to the amenity of nearby residential uses as a result of the arrival and departure of customers during the hours of operations, noise and disturbance associated with the proposed Beauty Salon therefore having a significant detrimental impact upon the amenity of occupiers of adjoining and nearby residential premises.  As such the proposal is contrary to Section 8 of the National Planning Policy Guidance 2012, Policies 7.1, 7.4, 7.15 of the London Plan 2016, Policy 1.1(g)(j), 2.10 of the adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012), and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed commercial development, by virtue of its location and relationship with its context would be out of character and incompatible as a use with the surrounding in the area, which in turn would be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area, contrary to the Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016, policies 1.1 (g) (h) and 1.2 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4, 7.6 , 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013."
