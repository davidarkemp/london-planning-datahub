    "The proposal due to its scale and design in close proximity to the shared boundaries would represent an unneighbourly form of development that would adversely impact the outlook from adjoining properties, to the detriment of the residential amenity of these occupants; and in combination with the substantial existing extensions to the dwelling, the proposal due to its design and scale would result in an overly large and visually unsympathetic development that is incongruous with the design of the original dwelling and the pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the appearance of the subject dwelling, and the character of the area as a whole. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4  and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and Section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
