    "The proposed non-material amendment to planning permission ref. P/215/1117 dated 26/08/2018 results in a scheme which increases the size of the building and would compromise the design and appearance of the building; and may result in a material impact on neighbours as a result of the increased scale and bulk adjacent to the shared boundaries contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan, and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD. The alteration is considered to be a material amendment to application P/2015/1117 dated 26/08/2018 contrary to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Planning Practice Guidance and the Ealing Protocol for Non-Material Amendments (2011)."
