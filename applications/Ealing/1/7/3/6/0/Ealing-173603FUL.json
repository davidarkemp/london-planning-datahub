    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, scale, design and siting, would result in an overdevelopment of the land to the rear of 9 Cumberland Park that would be incongruous with the surrounding pattern of development to the detriment of the distinct open and spacious character of the surrounding rear garden setting. As such, the proposed development would fail to adhere to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); 1.1(h) and 1.2(g) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2013); and 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposal fails to provide a high-quality and safe pedestrian environment for access and egress by future occupiers/visitors and a high-quality design response that makes people feel comfortable with their surroundings. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies 6.10, 7.3, and 7.4, of the London Plan (2016); 7.3 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan and Interim SPG 8: Safer Ealing. | The proposal fails to provide satisfactory arrangements for waste collection with contrary to policies 5.17 and 7.7 of the London Plan (2016) and Interim SPG 4 Refuse and Recycling Facilities."
