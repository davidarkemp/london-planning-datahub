    "Reason: To ensure the sustainable use of water, in accordance with policy 5.15 of the London Plan 2016. | Prior to the first occupation of each dwelling within the development, the approved residential units shall incorporate and maintain mitigation measures that will assist with reducing the risk of overheating, follow the Cooling Hierarchy and comply with CIBSE TM49 & TM59 criteria as stated in the Overheating Assessment issued in 30th November 2017 prepared by XCO2.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the dwellings hereby approved are energy efficient and to reduce the risk of overheating in line with policy 5.9 of the London Plan 2016, adopted Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2026 (3rd April 2012) and Development Management DPD (December 2013). | A) Within three-months of the first occupation of each dwelling in the approved development, Energy Performance Certificates [EPC's], detailed modelling output reports showing clearly the DER and TER from the \"as built stage\" to confirm compliance in terms of savings achieved through energy efficiency measures should be also submitted for written approval by the Local Authority.",
    "B) Within three-months of the practical completion of the dwellings, technical information and evidence that the renewable/low carbon technologies are certified under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MSC) and, if appropriate, complies with the Enhanced Capital Allowances (ECS) product criteria should be submitted.",
    "C) Prior to the final completion of the residential units, the approved scheme shall incorporate, maintain measures to achieve an overall reduction in regulated CO2 emissions of at least 35.1% (equal to 42.58 tonnesCO2/yr) beyond Building Regulations Part L 2013 through the following carbon emission savings as detailed in the approved Energy and Sustainability Statement issued in 18th July 2017 prepared by XCO2:",
    "i.\tenergy saving measures to achieve at least annual carbon dioxide emission savings of 3.2 tonnes CO2 equating to 16.6% in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the compliant BR Part L 2013 base case.",
    "ii.\tincorporation of at least 8.9kWp/~47sqm solar PV system to provide at least 6.9MWh/year electricity and achieve at least annual carbon dioxide emission savings of 3.5 tonnes CO2 equating to 18.5% in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions savings over the Be Lean stage of the Energy Hierarchy.",
    "The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved.",
    "Reason:  To ensure that the dwellings within the development hereby approved are energy efficient and to contribute to the avoidance of need for new fossil fuel or other primary energy generation capacity and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality in the interests of health, in accordance with policies 3.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.14 of the London Plan 2016, policies 1.1(e), 1.1(j), 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of Ealing's adopted Development (or Core) Strategy 2012, policies LV5.2 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD, and the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG. | All boilers accommodated in each residential unit to serve the energy requirements of each dwelling within the approved development should use Ultra low-NOx boilers with maximum NOx Emissions of under 0.030 g/kWh and be compliant with the NOx (g/m²) benchmarks as set out at Appendix 5 of the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG.",
    "The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy 7.14 of The London Plan (2016), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
