    "The proposed dwelling unit, by reason of its layout, siting and single-aspect design, would fail to provide appreciable outlooks, adequate separation between private and public spaces, adequate ventilation and circulation and genuinely private amenity space, to the detriment of the quality of accommodation and living conditions for future occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.3 of the London Plan (2016), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (2016). | The proposed development, by reason of its design, height, layout and proximity to neighbouring properties, would result in an incongruous, out of character and overbearing development to the detriment of the appearance of the local streetscene and visual amenity provided by the existing outlook available from neighbouring rear gardens. As such, the proposed development is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
