  "description": "Application for Minor Material Amendment (S73) to vary condition 2 (approved drawings) and condition 6 (glazing to windows at first floor level) of planning permission ref. 172732FUL dated 18/08/2017 for the Conversion of two semi-detached dwelling houses into four self-contained flats; two single storey rear extensions; two single storey front porch extensions; two hip to gable roof extensions; two rear roof extensions; installation of four roof lights on the front roof slope; with associated amenity space, cycle and refuse storage. Variation seeks to change approved drawings by removing chimney, removing a window in the western elevation at first floor level, installing an additional window in rear fa√ßade at first floor level and changing the external materials and finishes; and to change the wording of condition 6 so side facing windows in the western elevation at first floor level are obscure glazed, and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed",
