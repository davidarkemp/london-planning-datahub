  "description": "TPO no.128 - TREE 1 x Beech Tree - Crown lift of max 2.5 resulting in wounds no greater than 100mm, Crown thin of 15% resulting in wounds no greater than 100mm REASONS:  Periodic management of large tree in urban environment, close to houses.  Neighbours complaining of excessive shading.   N.B.This is the third application I have submitted in under a year for works to this tree (the first two both having been refused) and the tree's owners are very anxious to carry out the works this winter to appease increasingly litigious neighbours.  If there are any problems with this application, please contact me on 07900681887 or henrytwynam@mac.com to discuss amendments as having to make a 4th application would mean having to wait until the summer before doing the works to ensure the health of the tree.  Many thanks.",
