As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), the Norwood Green Conservation Area Appraisal and the Norwood Green Conservation Area Management Plan."
