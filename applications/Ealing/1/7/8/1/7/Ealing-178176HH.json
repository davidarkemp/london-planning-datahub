    "The proposed roof extensions, by reason of their scale, appearance, location, prominence and visibility from the public domain, would result in a development that would be out of proportion with a lack of subodination to the detriment of the appearance and character of the host building, adjacent matching dwelling, local roofscape and the Ealing Green Conservation Area. As such, the proposed development would fail to adhere to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016); Policies 1.1(h) and 1.2(g) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2013); Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and the Ealing Green Conservation Area Management Plan (2008)."
