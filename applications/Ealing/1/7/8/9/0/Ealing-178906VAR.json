    "The proposed variation of conditions 2, 3 and 6 and removal of conditions 7 and 9 are not considered to meet Council's criteria for \"minor material\" amendments as the proposed intensification of education use with the increase numbers staff and pupils, extended in hours of operation, and the removal of the restriction of use would significantly and materially alter the original development beyond what was approved. Therefore, the proposal does not represent a \"minor material\" change from the original planning permission with regard to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The proposed variation of condition 2, and the increase in the number of pupils, by reason of the intensity would be incompatible with the dynamics of the residential area as a whole and would result in detrimental impact on the character and amenity of the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 8 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies, 3.14, 3.16, 3.17, 3.18, 7.1, of the London Plan 2016; and policy 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed variation of conditions 2, 3 and 6 and removal of conditions 7 and 9, by virtue of its scale and intensity would cause harm to the amenity of occupiers of nearby dwellings due to noise and general disturbance associated with the nature of the use, including the use of the rear garden as a play area, and the increased level of comings and goings, both vehicular and pedestrian. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.15 of the London Plan 2016; and policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | Inadequate information has been submitted regarding the transport impacts and highway safety to allow the Local Planning Authority to assess whether the application site would be suitable from a highway point of view. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 6.3, 6.11 and 6.13 of the London Plan (2016)."
