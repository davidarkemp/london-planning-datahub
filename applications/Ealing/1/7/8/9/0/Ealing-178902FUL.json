    "The proposed rear extensions and dormers to the roofslope of the dwellinghouse represent a visually overbearing and incongruous development, which would add uncharacteristic volume and cluttered appearance to the roofscape, to the detriment of the appearance of the original locally listed building and the character of the Ealing Green Conservation Area as a whole. As such the proposal is considered contrary to London Plan (2016) Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8; Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C; and the aims and objectives of the Ealing Green Area Management Plan (2008)"
