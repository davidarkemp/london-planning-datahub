Insufficient information has been submitted in relation to installed replacement windows witin the whole property therefore it is not posssible to fully determine the impact on the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area as a whole. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 of the Adopted Ealing Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and Natinal Planning Policy Framework- section 12 - Conserving the Historic Environment."
