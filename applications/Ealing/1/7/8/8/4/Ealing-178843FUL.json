    "The proposed extension, by reason of it height, bulk, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and terrace as a whole. As such the proposed development would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 3.5 Quality and Design of Housing Developments,  Policy 6.13 (Parking) Policy 7.1 (Lifetime Neighbourhoods), Policy 7.4 (Local Character), Policy 7.6 (Architecture) of 'The London Plan', Policy 3.5 - Ealing Local Variation - Quality and Design of Housing Developments, Policy 7A Ealing Local Policy - Amenity, Policy 7.4 Ealing Local Variation - Local Character and Policy 7B Ealing Local Policy - Design Amenity. | The proposed side / rear extension, by reason of its scale, siting and design would represent an unneighbourly form of development, detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers of adjoining residential property at 226 and 230 South Ealing Road and 1 Darwin Road, particularly the loss of privacy and overbearingness. The proposal would be inconsistent with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012. | The formation Flat 2 and 3 by reason of its internal layout and lack of refuse storage and cycle parking would result in the overdevelopment of the property and would provide inadequate amenity and living conditions for future occupants. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 3.5, 6.9, 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015 and policies 1.1 (g) and 3.1 (c) of the Ealing's development (Core) Strategy 2026 and Ealing local variation to London Plan policy 3.4, 3.5 and 7.4 of the Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The Flat 3, by reason of its inadequate floor area, would provide for sub-standard living accommodation that contrary to the criteria set down under policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013 and the London Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance November 2012."
