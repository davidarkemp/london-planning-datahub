    "Reason: The temporary building is designed to have a temporary life and is only considered to be acceptable for use for a temporary period. It is also material that planning permission has been granted for permanent replacement community facilities to be provided as part of the Green Man Lane Estate regeneration masterplan. As such the Local Planning Authority is only prepared to grant permission for a limited period in view of the special circumstances raised by the phasing of the Green Man Lane Estate and St John's School regeneration proposals.",

    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| The approved temporary community centre (D1 Use Class) shall only be used between the hours of 0800-2300 on all days of the week.",
    "Reason: To ensure a satisfactory standard of residential amenity is provided for neighbouring residents and to assist to prevent noise and disturbance caused by patrons leaving the community facility, in accordance with policy 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013)."
