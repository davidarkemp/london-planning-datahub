    "The proposed three storey rear extensions and roof extensions with associated side and rear dormers, front lightwell enlargement and proposed bin storage by virtue of its excessive scale and relationship with the original building would represent an incongruous and over development of the site, out of keeping with the general pattern of development in the area and would detrimentally impact on the visual qualities of the street scene. As such the proposed development would be contrary to Policy 3.5, 7.1, 7.4, 7.6, 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), Policy 3.5, 7A, 7.4, 7B, 7C 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed three storey rear extensions and roof extensions would adversely impact the residential amenity of the ground floor rear unit of 39 The Mall, Ealing to the north due to loss of privacy and sunlight/daylight, contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed layout of Flats 1, 2 and 9 would result in poor daylight and ventilation to habitable rooms by virtue of their layouts, configuration, extensive depth and distance from windows. As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), Policy 3.5 of the Development Management DPD (2013), and the Department for Communities and Local Government's Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (March 2015). | The proposed conversion of a single family dwelling house to provide nine flats would result in an increased parking pressure outside the hours of operation of the CPZ notwithstanding any restriction on parking permits for the CPZ for occupiers of the development contrary to Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016)."
