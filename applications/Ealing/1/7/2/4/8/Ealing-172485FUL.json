As such, the proposed development would fail to adhere to the objective of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); Policies 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Development (Core) Strategy (2012); Policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and Interim Supplementary Planning Document 04 - Residential Extensions."
