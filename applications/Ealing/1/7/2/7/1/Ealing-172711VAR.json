    "b) incorporation of solar PV technology with a total capacity of 4.66kWp to supply at least 4 MWh of electricity annually and achieve at least annual carbon dioxide emission savings of 2.1 tonnes CO2 equating to 20.6% in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction over the Be Lean stage of the Energy Hierarchy.",
    "Within three-months of the first occupation of the new dwellings, Energy Performance Certificates, Accompany Advisory Reports and detailed SAP modelling output reports showing clearly the DER and TER for each unit from the \"as built stage\" to confirm compliance in terms of savings achieved through energy efficiency measures shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval.",
    "Reason:  To ensure that the development hereby approved is energy efficient and to contribute to the avoidance of need for new fossil fuel or other primary energy generation capacity and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality in the interests of health, in accordance with policies 3.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.14 of the London Plan 2015 (with FALP 2011/REMA 2013), policies 1.1(e), 1.1(j), 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of Ealing's adopted Development (or Core) Strategy 2012, policies LV5.2 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD, and the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG."
