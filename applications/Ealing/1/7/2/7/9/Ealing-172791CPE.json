    "Supporting evidence (Aerial Imagery of the Council) as required under Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by section 10 of the Planning & Compensation Act 1991), suggests the single storey rear extension has been in continuous use as part of the original dwelling for a period greater than 4 years. Also, the outbuilding falls within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. On the balance of probability a Lawful Development Certificate can be granted. It is therefore recommended that a Lawful Development Certificate be granted."
