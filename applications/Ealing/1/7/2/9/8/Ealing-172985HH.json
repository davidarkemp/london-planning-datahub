  "description": "Duplicate application see 172637HH - Replacement of derelict front door with new front door\nPlanning Enforcement case Ref: EN170061OD\n\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nWe would like retrospective planning permission regarding a change of the front door of 6 Ashbourne Road, W5 3ED. We purchased the property in April 2016. The property was uninhabitable and dangerous. We carried out extensive repairs and refurbishments after the property had been vacant for 10 years. The exterior work in particular is ongoing. \n\nUnfortunately, the front door itself had extensive damage and was beyond repair. Further, it could not be closed securely, and therefore was a safety risk for us - preventing us from moving into the premises. We were obliged to incur yet more expense and replace the door. We had difficulties sourcing a like for like replacement door, due to the age, dimensions and distortions of the door frame itself. Thus the door was irreparable. Finally, we were able to identify a door in a style sympathetic to the period and features of the house itself. The design of the door is in keeping with various other similar designs found nearby in the Haymills estate. The door is made of timber. It is of a high quality design and is of high cost.\n\nWe do hope that you will be able to understand our predicament, and our sincere effort to maintain the character of the Haymills Estate by upgrading a derelict property to habitable condition, thereby also contributing to the upkeep of the Haymills Estate overall.\n\n\nYours sincerely,\nAvneet & Sonia Chowdhury",
