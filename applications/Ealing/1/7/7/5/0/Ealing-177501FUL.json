    "The proposed basement light wells, as well as, the proposed rear extension, by reason of their size and siting, would result in the development of undersized light wells providing poor primary outlooks from habitable rooms, as well as, an unusable communal amenity space that would overlook numerous light wells to the detriment of the quality of the proposed accommodations, quality of the garden space and residential amenity of the host property. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012); and 3.5, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | Inadequate information was submitted regarding transport issues (including tracking diagrams depicting how vehicles could access and egress the site in a forward gear) to allow the Local Planning Authority to assess whether the application site would be, or could be rendered, suitable for the use proposed, without detriment to highway and pedestrian safety. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 6.3 of the London Plan (2016); and 1.1 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012)."
