    "There is insufficient supporting evidence, as required under Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by section 10 of the Planning & Compensation Act 1991), to demonstrate that on the balance of probability, the use of the rear outbuilding has, prior to the date of the application, been in continuous use as an outbuilding ancillary to the main dwelling for a period greater than 4 years.  Significantly, an enforcement notice was issued on 30 August 2017, in relation to the use of the outbuilding as a self-contained residential unit which interrupts the alleged four year period of continuous use of the outbuilding as ancillary to the main dwelling.  It is therefore recommended that a Lawful Development Certificate for existing use be refused."
