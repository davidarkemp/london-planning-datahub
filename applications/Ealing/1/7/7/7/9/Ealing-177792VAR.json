  "description": "COMBINED WITH 177791VAR  Application Reference Number: 161602FUL Date of Decision: 15/07/2016 Condition  Numbers 6 and 21  Removal:\n\nThe removal of conditions 6 & 21.  Planning condition 6 relates to provision of a final Travel Plan and planning condition 21 is a repeat of the same condition.  We feel the site is too small to warrant such a condition.\nThe reason for this application is that we consider the scheme to be too small to warrant a Travel Plan.  In addition, we feel that a Travel Plan is not necessary because sustainable transport measures have already been considered in the design and are referred to in other planning conditions.  \n\nIn section 5.4 of the Ealing Council SPD entitled 'Sustainable Transport for New Development', it states that 'in Ealing, a travel plan should also be submitted for. any residential development in excess of 25 units'. This project only has 15 units overall and is therefore well below the threshold.\n\nFurthermore, the scheme has a set number of car parking spaces and bicycle storage facilities that are shown on the approved plans and also stated in planning conditions 12 and 16.  Also, planning condition 7 sets out the number of car parking spaces to be provided with active and passive charging points for electric vehicles.  Therefore, we consider that sustainable transport measures are already going to be implemented.",
