    "The proposed two storey side and rear extension and hip to gable end roof extension would result in an incongruous development to the original dwelling which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the host property and streetscape. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4, and 7.6 of the London plan (2016), policies 1.1(g)(h), 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Development (Core) Strategy (2012), and policies 7.4, and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The proposed two storey side and rear extension would result in detrimental amenity impacts to no.s 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 Wells House Road with regards to loss of privacy, increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook and light. As such, it is considered that the proposal would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework, Policies 7.4, and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies 1.1 (g)(h), 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Ealing Development (core) Strategy, and policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013)."
