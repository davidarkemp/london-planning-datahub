    "The change of use from a residential garage (Use Class C3) to a Car Wrapping business (Use Class B2) by virtue of its location and relationship with its context would be out of character and incompatible as a use within the surrounding area. The change of use is considered to detrimentally impact on the amenity of nearby residential uses as a result of the arrival and departure of customers during the hours of operation, noise and disturbance associated with the business. As such the proposal is contrary to Section 8 of the National Planning Policy Guidance 2012, Policies 7.1, 7.4, 7.15 of the London Plan 2016, Policy 1.1(g)(j), 2.10 of the adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012), and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
