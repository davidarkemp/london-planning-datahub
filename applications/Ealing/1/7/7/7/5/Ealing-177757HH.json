    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, siting and design would constitute overdevelopment of the site out of keeping with the pattern of development in the area. It is also not considered to remain subordinate or secondary in nature to the original dwelling house to the detriment of the appearance of the existing building and the visual amenity of the streetscene. It would also present an overbearing development to the detriment of the residential amenity of the neighbouring property at 74 Lancaster Road. iIt is therefore considered that the proposed extension is contrary to Council's Interim guidance on residential extensions, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
