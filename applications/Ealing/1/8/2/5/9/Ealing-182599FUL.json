    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk, and siting would result in an unneighbourly and overbearing development that fails to respect the architectural integrity of the original building, to the detriment of the character of the area and would harm the residential amenity of 99 Church Road, Northolt.  As such the proposal would be contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016)."
