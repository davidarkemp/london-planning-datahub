    "The proposed office building would fall within 'Schedule 2 Development', as the overall proposal for the scheme falls within the definition of infrastructure projects 10(b), more specifically 'Urban Development Projects' that include more than 1 hectare of urban development which is not dwellinghouse development or the overall area of the development exceeds 5 hectares. The proposed office building as part of the wider redevelopment scheme albeit exceeding the approved quantum of floorspace would be a new application under the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) regime whereby the provisions set out in Regulations 6(1) and 6(2) are applicable. | The proposed development has been 'screened', having regard to the selection criteria for screening Schedule 2 development set out in 'Schedule 3'; namely having regard to (i) the characteristics of development; (ii) the location of development, and (iii) the characteristics of the potential impact. | On this basis the Local Planning Authority is of the opinion that the proposed development will not be likely to have significant effects on the environment as interpreted by the EIA Regulations 2017 and thereby does not constitute EIA development requiring an Environmental Statement. This is not to say that the proposed development will not have environmental effects of a localised nature which will need to be considered in determining any planning application(s)."
