    "The proposed design with regards the height of the eaves and roof juncture between number 163A and 165 Boston Road would be readily visible from the road and public space. They are not respectful to one another and would unduly draw the eye. It would be an incongruous feature and would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. As such the proposed development would be contrary to planning policies such as the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 3.5 Quality and Design of Housing Developments,  Policy 6.13 (Parking) Policy 7.1 (Lifetime Neighbourhoods), Policy 7.4 (Local Character), Policy 7.6 (Architecture) of 'The London Plan', Policy 3.5 - Ealing Local Variation - Quality and Design of Housing Developments, Policy 7A Ealing Local Policy - Amenity, Policy 7.4 Ealing Local Variation - Local Character and Policy 7B Ealing Local Policy - Design Amenity. | The proposed internal layout and lack of openings to the bedroom or the proposed windows being obscure glazed would result in substandard amenity and living conditions for future occupants. The provided amenity space would also be insufficient and substandard. The development is therefore contrary to planning policies such as the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 3.5 Quality and Design of Housing Developments, Policy 7.1 (Lifetime Neighbourhoods), Policy 7.4 (Local Character), Policy 7.6 (Architecture) of 'The London Plan', Policy 3.5 - Ealing Local Variation - Quality and Design of Housing Developments, Policy 7A Ealing Local Policy - Amenity, Policy 7.4 Ealing Local Variation - Local Character, Policy 7B Ealing Local Policy - Design Amenity and Policy 7D Ealing Local Policy - Open Space. | The siting, depth and height of the replacement building would harmfully enclose adjacent openings. It would lead to a loss of outlook to the openings to the rear of number 165 and could impact upon the light entering the openings to the side of 163 Boston Road. It would therefore cause significant harm to the living conditions of the adjacent properties and would be contrary to planning policies such as, 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016. | The existing commercial unit is currently empty and appears to be in need to repair but if this were carried out, it could be readily occupied. As the unit is within a primary shopping frontage and as the loss of this commercial space has not been sufficiently justified/ shown that it is no longer viable, it would cause significant harm in terms of employment opportunities and upon the economy. The development is therefore contrary to planning policies such as Policy 4A Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013 - Employment Uses as well as Policy 4.1 of the London Plan 2016."
