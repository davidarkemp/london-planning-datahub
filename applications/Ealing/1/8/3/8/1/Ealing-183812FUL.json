    "The addition of 3 floors to the roof of the existing 3 storey building by reason of its design, scale and massing will cumulatively generate an unduly prominent and ungainly addition that fails to be subservient to the original building and fails to be complementary or provide a positive architectural contribution to the surrounding area or character of the existing building. The proposal will appear dominant and highly visible within this uncomplicated streetscape and as such is contrary to policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2018). | The addition of 3 extra floors, in particular the 5th floor to the roof of the existing 3 storey building, will have a significant impact to the current amenity and general sense of privacy enjoyed by residents nearest to the site, as well as exacerbate the sense of enclosure already faced by occupants at nos. 2 and 4 First Avenue and no. 14 The Vale in particular, as a result of the increased height of the building. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 6.13 of the London Plan 2016, policy 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012) and policies 6.13, 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan DPD 2013. | In the absence of a legal agreement to secure planning obligations for the proposed uplift of new homes at 16 The Vale, the proposal fails to provide adequate control for additional pressures to parking or to provide affordable housing or the necessary mitigation as contributions to support Ealing's infrastructure for improvements to Acton Park, improvements to schools, improvements to the pedestrian and cycling realm between Acton Park and the development, and towards the delivery and service plan monitoring.  As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2018), London Plan (2016) policies 3.6, 3.11, 3.16, 3.18, 3.19, 6.9, 6.10, 6.13, 7.19, and 8.2; Ealing's Development Strategy 2026 DPD (2012) policies 1.1, 1.2, 6.2, and 6.4 ; the Ealing's Development Management DPD(2013) policies 3A, 6.13 and EA; and the Draft New London Plan policies GG3, H5, H6, S1, S3, T2, T3, T6 and DF1."
