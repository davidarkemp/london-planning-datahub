  "description": "TPO NO.498 - After inspection by an arboriculturist, it has been advised that the soil level around the Oak in the front garden of 4 West Road was increased within the last 15 years. This has had the effect of causing the ordinarily air exposed trunk to be surrounded by moist soil. When the arboriculturist removed some soil from around the trunk as a pilot, there was a strong smell of damp. It may be that this is what has contributed to the numerous fungal outbreaks (as evidenced and mentioned in a previous application to remove the tree), and it is the hope that by returning the soil level to it's original ground height, the trunk at the base will be able to dry out and breathe, enabling the Oak to have the best opportunity to re-invigorate and recover from it's current state.  The removal of the earth around the trunk will be carried out by hand to ensure that the trunk of the tree is protected. We hope that this enhances the wellbeing and health of the tree.",
