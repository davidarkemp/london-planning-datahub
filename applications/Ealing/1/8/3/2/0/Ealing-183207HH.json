    "The proposal due to its excessive width, scale, design and appearance would constitute an overdominant and incongruous development to the detriment to the visual amenity and character of the dwellinghouse, adjoining dwellinghouse and of the surrounding area and street scene. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework. | The proposal by virtue of its impact on the privacy of no. 5 Barnham Road would be considered an inappropriate form of development. It would form an unneighbourly development resulting in direct and unacceptable overlooking which has a detrimental impact upon the privacy of no. 5.  As such, the development is contrary to Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), Policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and Section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
