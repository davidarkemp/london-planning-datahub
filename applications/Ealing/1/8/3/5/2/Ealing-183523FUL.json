    "The proposed residential development, by virtue of its garden land location, form and relationship with its context would be out of character with the established pattern of development in the area, which in turn would be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the area and would be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2018), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), Policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The proposed development by reason of its design and in particular its fenestration and window detailing would fail to be consistent with the design and appearance of the dwellings within the surrounding area and would be in incongruous in appearance, serving detriment of the visual amenity of the existing streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016); policies 7.4 and of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2018)."
