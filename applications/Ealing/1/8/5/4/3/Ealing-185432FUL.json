    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | External materials to be used in the development shall include black aluminium window frames and a dark multi-brick for the rear elevation. All other materials, as labelled on the approved plans, shall comprise larch external cladding to the front and sides of the house and a sedum planted roof.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 5.11, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 and of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",

    "| At least 4 secure cycle parking spaces shall be provided on site and shall be retained thereafter.",
