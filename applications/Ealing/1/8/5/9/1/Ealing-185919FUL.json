    "The proposed subdivision of the roof space into two new studio flats facilitated by the erection of a substantial roof alteration, is considered unacceptable for reasons of their cramped size within a loft space setting, absence of built-in storage, poor outlook and poorly accessible outdoor amenity space; which cumulatively result in a substandard conversion conducive to a poor quality of living conditions for its future occupiers. Furthermore, the creation of two new flats within a building that is already converted into 10 flats is considered an intensification and over-conversion of an existing property that would be detrimental to the health, well-being and general amenity of its existing occupiers by way of added nuisance noise from extra footsteps and door openings and closures. As such, the proposal is considered to represent a contrived form of densification that fails to comply with the presumption in favour of sustainable development as set by the National Planning Policy Framework (2018) and is contrary to policies 3.4 and 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), and Ealing's development (Core) Strategy 2026 and Ealing's Development Management policies 7A and 7B; and the principles of Good Growth to provide high quality, well-designed, accessible homes  set out by Policy GG3 of the Draft | The proposed roof extensions, by reason of its excessive bulk, scale and relationship with the original main roof would represent an incongruous and overdevelopment to the original dwelling which is out of keeping with the character and appearance of the host property, the building pattern and the area as a whole. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London plan (2016), policies 1.1(g)(h), 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Development (Core) Strategy (2012), and the interim SPD 4."
