As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",

As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); the National Planning Policy Framework (2019); and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards."
