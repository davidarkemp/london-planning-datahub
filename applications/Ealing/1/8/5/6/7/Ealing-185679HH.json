    "The proposed roof alterations and enlargements, by reason of their design, massing, height and scale, would result in an overdevelopment of the original building's roof that would appear incongruous, overbearing and out of character to the detriment of the visual amenity provided by the appearance of the original dwellinghouse and neighbouring buildings. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to polices 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and Ealing's Supplementary Planning Document 4 - Residential Extensions."
