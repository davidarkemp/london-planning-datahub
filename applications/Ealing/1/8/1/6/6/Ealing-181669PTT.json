Healthy and structurally sound trees are capable of tolerating crown reductions of 30% of leaf volume, which is detailed as approximately 12% of branch length (allowing for variation in species).  The proposed works go well beyond this maximum level and as no information has been provided to show special/exceptional reasons (subsidence damage, structural damage to the tree, etc.) for such a level of reduction the works are refused.",

To avoid ambiguity, the specified end result can be stated either as the tree-height and branch-spread which are to remain, or the average equivalent in branch length (in metres).\" The proposed works do not provide such detail.",
