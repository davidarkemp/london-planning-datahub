    "The proposed self-contained outbuilding would constitute a cramped backland development that could not be accommodated at the site without a siting, site layout and access that would be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development of the area causing harm to surrounding amenity and character. As such, it is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | Irrespective of the above reason, insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that such a development could achieve an acceptable scale and appearance while providing sufficient quality living conditions for future occupiers without compromising the residential amenity of surrounding occupiers including those of the main dwellinghouse. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5, 7.4, 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
