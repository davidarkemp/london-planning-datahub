    "The proposed residential development, by virtue of its garden land location, form and relationship with its context would be out of character with the established pattern of development in the area, which in turn would be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the area and would be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2015, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposed residential development, by virtue of its bulk/massing, design, unproportioned elevational treatment of the front and rear elevations and its erosion of the space between 20 and 22 St Andrews Road, would be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the area and street scene. As such the proposal would be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposed residential development would result in the unsatisfactory development of the site and would provide inadequate amenity and living conditions for future occupiers by reason of the Gross Internal Areas failing to meet minimum floorspace standards, which would be detrimental to the residential amenity of future occupiers of development. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016) and policies 1.1 (e) and 2.1 (c) of the Ealing's development (Core) Strategy 2026 and Ealing local variation to London Plan policy 3.4, 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed development, by virtue of its scale and bulk that would be viewable in close quarters from the rear of properties on Brassie Road, in particular on 27 Brassie Road the development would give rise to unacceptable amenity impacts in the form of overbearing sense of enclosure and loss of outlook impacts, contrary to policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012."
