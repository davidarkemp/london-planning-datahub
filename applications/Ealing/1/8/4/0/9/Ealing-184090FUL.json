Insufficient information has been submitted to justify the loss and harm to the function, openness and biodiversity value of the open space. As such, the development would be contrary to Policy 7.19 of the London Plan and Policy 2.18 of Ealing's Development Management DPD. | Insufficient information has been provided to satisfy the Council that appropriate drainage measures would be installed to reduce the risk of flooding and meet the requirements of London Plan Policies 5.12 and 5.13 and Draft London Plan Policies SI12 and SI13. | The provision of only two access points to/from the east of the site, while installing boundary fences to the north, west and south of the site would be contrary to the objectives of the London Plan (Policies 3.2, 6.9, 6.10 and 6.12) and Draft London Plan (Policies T1, T2, T4, T5 and D3) which promote pedestrian and cycle permeability to encourage and facilitate the use of sustainable modes of transport. | The proposal would not integrate sufficient green infrastructure to comply with the objectives of the London Plan (Policy 5.10). Reducing the site's Urban Greening Factor from a score of 1 to 0.14 would cause inappropriate harm to the quantity and quality of greening and would fail to meet the Draft London Plan's (Policy G5) recommended score of 0.4. | No green roofs have been proposed which is contrary to Policy 5.11 of the London Plan, Policy G5 of the Draft London Plan and Policy 5.11 of Ealing's Development Management DPD. | The proposed boundary treatment (1.6 metre chain link fence) would be an inappropriate design solution and would be contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.5 of the London Plan, Policies D1 and D2 and Policies 7.4 and 7B of Ealing's Development Management DPD. | In the absence of agreement to the necessary planning obligations (affordable housing, health, education, carbon offsetting, renewable energy monitoring, highways improvement works and travel plan, biodiversity and landscape re-provision and improvement works) via a section 106 legal agreement, the proposed development would cause unmitigated and unacceptable harm regarding genuinely affordable housing, health and education provision, highways improvement works and sustainable transport, carbon emissions reduction and biodiversity and landscaping. This would be contrary to Policies 2.18, 3.2, 3.6, 3.12, 3.13, 3.16, 3.17, 3.18, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.3, 6.9, 6.10, 6.12, 6.13, 8.2 and 7.19 of the London Plan and Policies 3A, 5.2, 7D and EA of Ealing's Development Management DPD. | Inadequate access arrangements to waste storage facilities, contrary to Policy 5.17 of the London Plan, Policy SI7 of the Draft London Plan and Ealing's SPG 4 - Storing waste for recycling and disposal. | The proposed provision of 118 cycle parking spaces does not meet the minimum requirements set by Table 6.3 of the London Plan which requires a minimum of 248 cycle parking spaces to be provided onsite."
