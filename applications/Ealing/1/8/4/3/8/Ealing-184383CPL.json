  "description": "Back extension of ground floor flat. Flat is already extended at the back to the left of the property (about a 2x2m extension). We wish to extend to the right back to the same amount. This will increase the kitchen/dining area by 2x2m. There will be 3 large spotlights installed in the roof of the extension allowing more light to pass through than currently and the height will not exceed the current height of the left extension. No changes to the front of the property will occur and the general public will not be able to see the extension.",
