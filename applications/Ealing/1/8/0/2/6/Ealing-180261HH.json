    "The proposed first floor extension, resulting in a two-storey rear extension of the original host dwellinghouse, when coupled with existing development on site including the roof extension and outbuildings, would result in an incongruous and overdevelopment to the original dwelling which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the host property and streetscape. The proposal is therefore considered contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4, and 7.6 of the London plan (2016), policies 1.1(g)(h), 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Development (Core) Strategy (2012), and policies 7.4, and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The proposed first floor extension would result in detrimental amenity impacts to neighbouring nos. 6 and 10 Balmoral Gardens with regards to loss of privacy, increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook and light. As such, it is considered that the proposal would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework, Policies 7.4, and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies 1.1 (g)(h), 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Ealing Development (core) Strategy, and policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013)."
