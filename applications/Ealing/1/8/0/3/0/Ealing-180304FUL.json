A) Within three-months of the first occupation of each residential unit within the approved development, Energy Performance Certificates [EPC's], detailed modelling output reports showing clearly the DER and TER from the \"as built stage\" to confirm compliance in terms of savings achieved through energy efficiency measures should be also submitted for written approval by the Local Authority.",
    "B) Within three-months of the practical completion of each residential unit within the approved development evidence that the renewable/low carbon technology(ies) are certified under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MSC) and, if appropriate, complies with the Enhanced Capital Allowances (ECS) product criteria should be submitted.",
    "C) Prior to occupation of each residential unit within the development, the approved dwellings shall incorporate and maintain measures to achieve an overall reduction in regulated CO2 emissions of at least 36.47% (equal to 16.27 tonnesCO2/yr) beyond Building Regulations Part L 2013 through the following carbon emission savings as detailed in the approved Sustainability and Energy Statement Rev C (10 January 2018), prepared by SRE Ltd:",
