    "An enforcement notice has been issued in relation to the use of the outbuilding as a self-contained residential unit which proves the use is not immune from enforcement action and the use would be in contravention of the requirements of the enforcement notice in force.  The enforcement notice took effect from 12 June 2017, requiring compliance by 12 September 2017, and effectively interrupts any continuous period of use.  The application is therefore contrary to section 191(3)(a) and 191(3)(b) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. It is therefore recommended that a Lawful Development Certificate be refused."
