    "The width of the proposed crossover would be excessively wide and the size and scale would be detrimental to highway safety. It would likely result in a danger to highway users as well as pedestrians using the footpath. As such the proposal does not comply with Policy T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 1.1 (f) of the Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The siting of the proposed new footpath along with the siting of the shared bin store would be visually out of keeping and could cause harm to a tree in a neighbouring garden. The scheme would therefore be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The siting of the shared footpath along the boundary of number 252 and 254 Empire Road could lead to a harmful loss of privacy to the occupier of the new dwelling. The occupier of 252 could reasonably stand in front of the ground floor window to the new dwelling and look into this opening. This would therefore cause a harmful increase in overlooking/ loss of privacy ad would be contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
