    "The proposed extensions by reason of design, scale, bulk and proportions would result in an incongruous and overbearing development that would detrimentally harm the architectural integrity of the original dwelling, the visual amenity of the street scene and the character of the area, and the proposed extensions by reason of design, scale, bulk and siting would detrimentally harm the living conditions of the occupants of the adjoining property to the south, No. 18, by way of being overbearing and increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012); 7B, and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Section 4 of Ealing's Supplementary Planning Document 4 - Residential Extensions. | The proposed development by way of insufficient internal floor area for Flat 3, single aspect units and poor access to light, poor levels of privacy for the ground floor front facing flat and insufficient external amenity space provision for three flats, would be representative of an overdevelopment of the site and would result in sub-standard living conditions for future occupants.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.3 of the London Plan (2016); 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and the Supplementary Planning Guidance - Housing (2016)."
