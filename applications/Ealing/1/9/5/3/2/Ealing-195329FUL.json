    "The proposed tower mounted equipment, by reason of their position, size, colour and their supporting steelwork, cumulatively generate a prominent, cluttered and incongruous addition that fails to be sympathetic to the host building, to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the locally listed building, the street scene and the wider Conservation Area.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan, policy HC1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021); and the NPPF 2021."
