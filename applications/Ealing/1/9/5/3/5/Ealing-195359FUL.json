    "The application has failed to demonstrate the actual number of units on the site or the number of units that is being applied for. The submitted plans show both six and seven units located on the rear wall whilst the recent appeal decision states that there are actually eight units on the rear wall. It is therefore not possible to ascertain the actual number of units or the associated impact upon the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area or the impact upon the living conditions of the adjacent properties. This is therefore contrary to objectives of Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | In spite of reason for refusal number 1, the proposed units by virtue of their siting as well as their height and number would cause harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | In spite of reason for refusal number 1, the siting of the proposed units would cause harm to the living conditions of the neighbouring properties. They would create a harmful amount of noise which would cause harm to the surrounding residential dwellings. This would adversely affect the residential amenity of these occupiers contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D6 and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
