    "The proposed part single, part three storey rear extension by reason of its design and scale at second floor level, would appear as an incongruous and visually prominent addition which would fail to remain subordinate to the host building, serving detriment to the character of the host building and the surrounding vicinity. As such the proposal is contrary to policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), the London Plan Supplementary Planning Guidance and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed part single, part three storey extension by reason of its scale and distance to the boundary at first and second floor levels would in a loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure to the occupiers of at No. 116 Horn Lane. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly impacted upon by the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed unit mix by reason of its proliferation of studio and 1-bedroom units and lack of family sized units would be detrimental to the original character of the existing family sized dwellinghouse and would be contrary to Section 5 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and the guidance listed in the Ealing Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2018)."
