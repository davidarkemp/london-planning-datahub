    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, depth, massing, scale, dominance and siting, would constitute an incongruous and overbearing addition, that would harm the visual appearance and architectural integrity of the host dwelling and create a sense of enclosure to the detriment of the character of the area and the residential and visual amenities of neighbouring sites. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and SPD4."
