    "The proposed change of use of the retail unit to a restaurant within the West Ealing Town Centre by way of its layout, design and size of extension would result in an intensification of the application site, which would have a detrimental impact on neighbouring amenity by way of an increase in noise and disturbance from use of the partly open extension and an increase in comings and goings. The proposal is therefore contrary to Local Policy 4C, 7A and 7B of the Development Management, 'Development Plan Document' (2013); the Development (Or Core) Strategy (2012); policies 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 7.4, 7.14 and 7.15 of the London Plan (2016); and National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposed rear extension and external flue on the rear of building due to their scale and design, and choice of materials for the existing building and proposed extensions would be visually incongruous additions, particularly due to their prominence and visibility within streetscene and would be harmful to the character and appearance of the building and the visual amenity of the street scene. The proposal is therefore contrary to the objectives of section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016). | The proposed external seating area to the front of the building and single storey part open rear addition by reason of their siting to the front and rear of the premises respectively and their open/ part open design would allow noise and odour emissions to be emitted and introduce increased commercial activity onto the predominately residential Grosvenor Road. The proposal would have a detrimental impact on neighbouring amenity by way of its siting close to residential properties and its design. The proposal is there contrary to Local Policy 4C, 7A and 7B of the Development Management, 'Development Plan Document' (2013); the Development (Or Core) Strategy (2012); policies 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016); and National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
