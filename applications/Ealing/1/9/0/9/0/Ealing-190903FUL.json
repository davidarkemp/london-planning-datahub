    "The proposed four storey building within the Public House garden would place restriction on the use of the site as a Public House which would cause substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset, due to the loss of the Public House garden area and irreversible alteration to create self-contained flats and would see the potential functionality of the site as a Public House which has heritage, social and cultural value.  Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to policies E10, HC1, HC7, D13 of the London Plan (2021) policies 1.1 (Spatial Vision for Ealing), 1.2(g) (Delivery of the Vision for Ealing) of the Ealing Core Strategy 2012, policies 7.4 and 7C  of the Ealing adopted Development Management Development Planning Document (2013). And contrary to paragraphs Chapter 12 (Conserving and enhancing the historic environment) of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, height, form and relationship with the adjacent Public House and its context would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. The position of the building would have a detrimental impact on the TPO Willow tree to the front of the site. The proposal would result in an unacceptable and harmful scheme that would give a bland, incongruous and cramped form of development that would fail to take account of the existing pattern of development along the canal and  its prominent corner position or enhance the local character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policies D4 ,D5 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed four storey building due to its siting, proportions and closeness to neighbouring properties on Tilney Road, appears likely to have a harmful effect on the residential amenity presently enjoyed by adjoining occupiers by reason of potential loss of light to rear gardens and rear elevations, overlooking of rear gardens, it's overbearing appearance and loss of outlook. As such the proposal is considered contrary section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, policies 1.1 (g) (h), 1.2 (h) and 4.1 (d) of the adopted Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies ELV 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of its inadequate floor-to ceiling heights, lack of sufficient and fit for purpose private amenity space for the self-contained units and poorly sited and inadequately sized private amenity space for all units at upper floor level, would result in the detriment of the amenities of future residents of the development, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed addition of a residential building combined with seven new parking spaces in an outer London area with low public transport accessibility is considered to constitute an undesirable form of development which would be likely to exacerbate car parking stress in the area, to the detriment of the amenity of existing residents and to highway safety. There are concerns with the proposed manoeuvrability  of vehicles and whether they can enter and exit safely adjacent to the towpath. As such the proposal does not comply with policy T3 of the London Plan (2021)and Policy 1.1 (f) of the Development (Core) Strategy (2012)."
