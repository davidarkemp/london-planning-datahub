    "The proposed side roof dormers would represent an incongruos feature which would harm the appearance of the subject dwelling, the terrace as whole and the visual amenity of the streetscene. It is therefore considered that the proposed extension is contrary to Council's Interim guidance SPD4 Residential Extensions, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of scale, bulk, prominence and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development that would have an overbearing nature, increased sense of enclosure and loss of light upon 131 C Windmill Lane. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
