As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5, 5.16, 6.9, 6.13 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), policy 1.1 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 3.5, 7A, 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).",
    "| The proposed development, by reason of the increase in occupants proposed, would result in an inappropriate level and type of occupation resulting in a detrimental impact on residential amenities of neighbouring properties in the application street and abutting the application site.  Additionally, the proposal would have an unacceptable increase in parking pressure outside the hours of the CPZ, particularly during the evenings and at weekends, notwithstanding any restrictions on parking permits for the CPZ for occupants of the development.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 6.13, 7.2, and 7.4  of the London Plan (2016), policy 1.1 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 3.5, 7A, and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
