As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan. | The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its depth, height and proximity to the shared boundary would constitute an overbearing form of development, to the detriment of the amenity of the occupants of no. 15 Thirsk Close. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan. | The proposal would fail to provide an adequate amount of amenity space for the future occupants of both proposed residential dwellings to the detriment of the living conditions.  As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
