    "The proposed development, by reason of its design, scale, height, proposed use and siting in the rear garden, would be an incongruous form of development, failing to be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of development, to the detriment of the character of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the objectives of Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan and Policy LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proposed new dwellings within the rear garden would result in an unacceptable loss and poorer quality of communal amenity space for the occupants of the existing flats at 121-123 Wood End Lane, to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupiers of these residential units. As such the proposal would be contrary to the objectives of Policies 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proposed dwellings, by reason of their siting, proximity to the boundary and height, would result in overlooking and the loss of privacy of the rear gardens of properties on Russell Road to the detriment of their residential amenity. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the objectives of Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proposed dwellings would fail to provide an adeuqate amount of quality private amenity space, to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupants of the dwellings. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
