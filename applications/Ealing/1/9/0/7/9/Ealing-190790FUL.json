    "o\tFull planting specification - tree size, species, the numbers of trees and any changes from the original application proposals.",
    "o\tLocations of all proposed species.",
    "o\tComprehensive details of ground/tree pit preparation to include:",
    "o\tPlans detailing adequate soil volume provision to allow the tree to grow to maturity",
    "o\tEngineering solutions to demonstrate the tree will not interfere with structures (e.g. root barriers/deflectors) in the future",
    "o\tStaking/tying method(s).",
    "o\tFive year post planting maintenance and inspection schedule.",
    "All tree planting must be carried out in full accordance with the approved scheme in the nearest planting season (1st October to 28th February inclusive). The quality of all approved tree planting should be carried out to the levels detailed in British Standard 8545, Trees: from nursery to independence in the landscape - Recommendations.",
    "Any trees which die, are removed, uprooted, significantly damaged, become diseased or malformed within five years from the completion of planting, must be replaced during the nearest planting season (1st October to 31st March inclusive) with a tree/s of the same size, species and quality as previously approved.",
    "Reason: To ensure appropriate tree protection in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies 5.10 and 7.21 of the London Plan, policy 5.10 of Ealing's Development Management DPD and Ealing's SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines.",
    "| No operations (including initial site clearance) shall commence on site in connection with development hereby approved until a suitable foundation specification has been submitted and approved by the Local Planning Authority.  The foundation details shall include the following:",
    "o\tUse a 250 mm diameter bore hole approximately 3 metres deep to create the piles.",
    "o\tBeams that span between the piles to be level with the internal floor to create a void above ground-level of approximately 250mm.",
    "o\tAll piles will be sheathed to prevent the leaking of concrete that may poison the adjacent tree.",
    "o\tThe specification should not require digging down below ground-level (beyond the creation of the piles) or otherwise disturb the existing ground-level.",
    "o\tTo provide water and oxygen access for the tree's roots the wall below the floor must be vented by airbricks, whilst rainwater should be directed down below the floor (not into a soakaway).",
    "Reason: In order to safeguard trees and other vegetation considered to be worthy of retention in the interests of amenity for the area.",
    "| No trees, shrubs or hedges within the site which are shown to be retained on the approved plans (Plan/Drawing:) shall be felled, uprooted, wilfully damaged or destroyed, cut back in any way or removed without previous written consent of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Any shrubs or hedges removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming seriously diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced with shrubs or hedge plants or similar species capable of achieving a comparable size unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.",
    "Any trees removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming seriously diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced in accordance with trees, shrubs or hedge plants of similar size and species unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.",
    "Reason: to secure the protection throughout the time that development is being carried out, of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within the site which are of amenity value to the area in accordance with policies 5.10 and 7.21 of the London Plan, policy 5.10 of Ealing's Development Management DPD and Ealing's SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines.",
    "| No part of the roof of the building hereby approved shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",
    "Reason: To protect the living conditions of nearby properties in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan (2016), polices 7.4, 7A & 7B of the Adopted Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013) and polices 1.1 (e)(g), 1.2 (f), 2.1(c) and 2.10 Adopted Development (Core) Strategy 2012."
