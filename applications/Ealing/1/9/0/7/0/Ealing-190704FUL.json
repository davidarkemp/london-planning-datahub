    "The proposed residential dwellings, by reason of their lack of sufficient sunlight provision due to their siting and orientation; lack of fit for purpose private amenity space; compromised outlook; and inappropriate access arrangement, would cumulatively result in an insecure and substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of future occupiers of the dwellings.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D3, D4, D5, D6, D11 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), policy 3.5, 7.3, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and the London Housing SPG (Updated 2017). | The proposed development, by reason of the resultant demolition of the ground floor rear projection to number 8 The Vale in order to accommodate the development, would result in the significant loss of external communal amenity space to occupiers of neighbouring flats at 8 and 10 The Vale, to the detriment of the amenity of existing and future occupiers of these neighbouring dwellings.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan, policies 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and section 12 of the NPPF (2021)."
