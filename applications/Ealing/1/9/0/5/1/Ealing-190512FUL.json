The proposal would therefore provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of both the existing and future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2018). | The proposed alterations to the roof which include the increase in height and overall design would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area, and its character and appearance, contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013."
