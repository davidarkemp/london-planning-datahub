    "The proposed fascia and freestanding signage, by reason of their scale and appearance would result in advertisements that would be overly-prominent and incongruous in terms of the visual amenity provided by the residential character of the local streetscene. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); Policy 3.8 of the Local Development Framework (Core) Strategy (2012); and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013)."
