  "description": "TPO no.997 - T1 Lime - Reduce height and branch radius by 3 metres to leave height of 15 metres and remove epicormic growth at base;  T2 Lime - Reduce height and branch radius by 3 metres to leave height of 16 metres and remove epicormic growth at base;  T3 Lime - Reduce height and branch radius by 3 metres to leave height of 16 metres and remove epicormic growth at base\n\nReason: The subject trees are lapsed pollards, with previous pollarding having been undertaken at approx 3 metres (true pollard) and then at a higher secondary point at roughly half the current height of the trees. The purpose of the proposed work is to create a tertiary pollard point that can be regularly maintained in order to provide an enhanced spatial relationship with the garden, and in order to reduce loading on the unions at the original and secondary pollard points. This will reduce the likelihood of the multiple secondary stems from breaking out as end weight and wind resistance increases.",
