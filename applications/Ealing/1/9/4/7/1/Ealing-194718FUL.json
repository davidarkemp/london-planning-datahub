    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, bulk, massing, height, proportions, design, appearance and configuration of rear external amenity spaces would represent an overdevelopment of the site that would not respect the established urban grain to the detriment of the character of the area and the visual amenity of the street scene, contrary to policies 7.4, 7B & 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposed development by way of scale, bulk, siting, design and window placement with single aspect units at ground floor level on the rear elevation would result in minimal access to light, reduced privacy and increased overlooking to the detriment of the living conditions for the future occupants, and the proposed design, height, scale and bulk would result in amenity impacts on neighbouring properties by way of being overbearing and increased sense of enclosure on No. 84, and configuration of external amenity spaces would result in undue noise disturbance, increased overlooking and loss of privacy on the rear dwelling at No. 86A.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); the National Planning Policy Framework (2019); and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). | The proposed development would provide substandard living conditions to future occupiers. The proposed GIA for three of the proposed units would fail to meet the minimum standards as set out in the London Plan and Technical Housing Standards which would create a cramped and poor standard of accommodation contrary to policeis 7A, and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), policy  3.5 of the London Plan (2016) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015)."
