    "The roof extension would constitute to development of one self-contained studio flat which would be below the minimum size requirements specified in the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). The studio flat would cause significant harm to the amenity of the residents of the unit, contrary to policies 3.5 and 3.8 of the London Plan (2016), policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and London Housing SPG (2016). | The proposed rear roof extension, by reason of their size, siting and design would represent an unneighbourly form of development, detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers of adjoining residential property at 4 High Street in terms of loss of privacy, and overdominance, and harm the character and appearance the wider area. The proposal would be inconsistent with Section 12 of the NPPF, policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and the Acton Town Centre Conservation Area Management Plan."
