    "The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension, by reason of its design, scale and materials would appear as an incongruous and visually prominent addition which would be out of keeping with the character of the host building and the surrounding vicinity. As such the proposal is contrary to policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), the London Plan Supplementary Planning Guidance and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension by reason of its scale and distance to the boundary bulk would in an increased sense of enclosure to the neighbour at No. 19 Rusthall Avenue. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly impacted upon by the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
