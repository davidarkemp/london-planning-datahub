  "description": "It is a Eucalyptus tree which is within the zone of influence of four properties on Squirrel Mews all of whom are experiencing signs of movement and cracking in their homes. A colleague of mine from the Earthworks team within Network Rail has carried out a site inspection track side, and advised the following : \"The slope adjacent to the property of concern at Squirrel Mews is approx 4/5m in height with a slope angle of 30-35degrees, well vegetated with scrubby vegetation and brambles along the upper slope.  The lower slope is clear with only patchy scrub and grass present, two buddleia bushes were observed growing against the lineside neighbour's wall which will be cleared by local teams.  A large mature tree is present within 10m of the claimant's property and it is my recommendation this is removed as the property is within the zone of influence for the trees root system. Another mature tree is located approximately 10-12m from the front of the property not on NR land.  The homeowner is to approach the consultant who carried out survey works to determine if this tree is also causing a potential desiccation issue that may affect their property.\"",
