  "description": "Complete Fell and stump removal of 1x Prunus species, located at the front of the property. (Tree is not currently marked on the conservation plan) falls under automatic TPO due to trunk girth exceeding 12-14 measurement \nTree is of poor shape due to prior pruning adding no aesthetic value to the property or street, there are crossing branches and dieback, with new growth potentially causing failure points along branches. further branches could fail in the future.\nTree has been shaded out by near by street tree (Platanus x hispanica?) causing a lean of growth on the specimen making this prone to failure in extreme weathers.\nOverall health of tree is low.\nDue to swell and shrink of the soil and the proximity to the boundary walls and house, (both which are listed under the Bedford park conservation area) could cause future potential damage at a cost to the owner.\nto counter the loss of this Prunus Six trees have been planted at rear of property, 3x Pleached Fagus Sylvatica 2.5m, 3x Fan trained Prunus cultivars 1.8m which would offset and compensate for the removal of the proposed Prunus species. \nProposed future plans for the front area of the property is to turn into a new area of herbaceous planting.",
