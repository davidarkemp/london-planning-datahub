    "The proposed development constitutes an `Urban development project` under `Schedule 2 of the Regulations within Section 10 Infrastructure Projects, sub section (b). The site exceeds the threshold of 150 dwellings. | The proposed development has accordingly been screened having regard to the selection criteria for screening Schedule 2 development set out in `Schedule 3` of the EIA Regulations 2017 (As amended): namely having regard to (i) the characteristics of development, (ii) the location of development, and (iii) the characteristics of the potential impact. | On the basis of the above, the Local Planning Authority is of the opinion that the proposed development would not be likely to have significant effects on the environment as interpreted by the EIA Regulations 2017 and thereby does not constitute EIA development requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or Environmental Statement (ES). This is not to say that the proposed development would not have environmental effects of a localised nature which would need to be considered in determining any subsequent planning application."
