    "The proposed single-storey rear/infill extension, by reason of its depth and fenestration, would result in an overdevelopment of the dwellinghouse that would appear insubordinate to the building and out of line with the original fenestration to the detriment of the visual amenity provided by the historic character and appearance of the building. Furthermore, the proposed single-storey side extension to the outbuilding, by reason of its height and area, would result in an overdevelopment of the existing garage that would be out of keeping with the small-scale and inconspicuous appearance characteristic of garden buildings of the Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016); 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012); 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Sections 5.3 and 5.5 of the Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area Management Plan (2009); and 5 of Ealing's Supplementary Planning Document 4 - Residential Extensions."
