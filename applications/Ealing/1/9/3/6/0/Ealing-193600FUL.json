The potential for additional residential development is better considered in the context of its bulk, scale, design, sustainability, amenity and the desirability of protecting and enhancing the character of the area and the relationship with neighbouring sites and retained development on this and neighbouring sites. These matters are discussed in detail in the remainder of this assessment."
