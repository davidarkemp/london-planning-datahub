    "The proposed development by reason of design, scale, bulk, massing, siting and roof forms would result in a form of overdevelopment of the subject site which would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous, overbearing, and dominant addition to the building and would be harmful to the visual amenity and character of the area. As such the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
