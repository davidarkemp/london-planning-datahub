    "The proposed conversion to large HMO's, by reason of the number of beds and occupants, would result in the over-intensification of the residential use of the host properties.  The resultant effect would be an unacceptable level of nuisance noise and disturbance by way of an increase number of people movements in and out of the property, to the detriment of the future occupiers and neighbouring residential amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2016), policy 1.1 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 3.5, 7A, 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of the insufficient provision of communal living space, cooking facilities and food preparation space without the adequate provision of such areas within the individual sleeping rooms, would result in a substandard form of shared-housing accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions for future occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Housing SPG 2016, Technical Housing Standards 2015, Ealing's development (Core) Strategy 2026, policy 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
