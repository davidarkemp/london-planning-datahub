The development would therefore be contrary to Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), Policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy, Policy 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and the Brunswick Conservation Area Management Plan (2007). | The proposed annexe, by virtue of its excessive footprint and internal layout would fail to be satisfactorily ancillary to the main dwellinghouse and the overall character of the area contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
