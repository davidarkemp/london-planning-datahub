  "description": "TPO no.997 - T1 Lime - Reduce crown/height by 10 metres to previous secondary pollarding points at 8 metres, retaining pollard head and retaining all pollarded forks. Remove all other stem and branch growth. \nT2 Lime - Reduce crown/height by 9 metres to previous secondary pollarding points at 10 metres, retaining pollard head and retaining all pollarded forks. Remove all other stem and branch growth. \nT3 Lime - Reduce crown/height by 10 metres to previous secondary pollarding points at 9 metres, retaining pollard head and retaining all pollarded forks. \nRemove all other stem and branch growth.\n\nReason: The subject trees are lapsed pollards, with previous pollarding having been undertaken at approx 3 metres (true pollard) and then at a higher secondary point at roughly half the current height of the trees. The purpose of the proposed work is to reinstate the previous secondary pollarding regime in order to maintain an enhanced spatial relationship with the garden, and in order to reduce loading on the unions at the original pollard point. This will reduce the likelihood of the multiple secondary stems from breaking out as they increase in diameter.",
