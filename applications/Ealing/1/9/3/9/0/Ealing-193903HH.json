    "Due to its excessive height, scale, bulk, site coverage, design and access the proposal would fail to relate subordinately to the main dwelling resulting in a contrived and incongruous appearance that would result in harm to the Ramillies Road streetscene and to the character and appearance of the local area. As such the proposal would be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.B of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013 and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016. | The proposal would result in significant and unacceptable harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers by way of a loss of privacy and an overbearing and unneighbourly sense of enclosure contrary to policies 7B of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013."
