    "The proposed development by virtue of its design, appearance, siting, and relationship with No. 12 Park Road and the outbuilding to the rear of 83 Shakespeare Road would represent a cramped form of overdevelopment at the site, to the detriment to the character of the area and the visual amenity of the street scene, and the proposed development would result in sub-standard living conditions for future occupants by way of roof lights located wholly at the loft level to serve two habitable rooms and insufficient amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies contrary to policies 7.4 , 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
