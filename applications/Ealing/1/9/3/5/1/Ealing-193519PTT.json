  "description": "TPO no.749 railway land to rear - It is proposed to fell Ash (T1) and Elder (S2).\n\nAsh T1 is twin-stemmed and one stem is smothered in ivy (tight forks may be present beneath the ivy). A group of mature trees has recently been removed to the south of the tree and it has now lost its shelter from the prevailing south-westerly winds. Its crown is also asymmetrical due its growth being suppressed by these trees. The Ash is within falling distance of the nearby railway. \n\nElder S2 is causing damage to the rear boundary fence. \n\nTwo ornamental flowering Cherry trees will be planted close to the rear boundary to mitigate.",
