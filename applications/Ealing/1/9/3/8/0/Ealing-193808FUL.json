These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies 7.4, and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016). | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of enhanced sound insulation value DnT,w [and L'nT,w] of at least 5-10dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/e=ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings, ie. Kitchen/dining and living rooms above/below bedroom of separate dwellings.  Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation for the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

The potential for additional residential development is better considered in the context of its bulk, scale, design, sustainability, amenity and the desirability of protecting and enhancing the character of the area and the relationship with neighbouring sites and retained development on this and neighbouring sites. These matters are discussed in detail in the remainder of this assessment."
