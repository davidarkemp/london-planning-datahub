    "The proposal due to its siting in relation to no. 23 Jersey Road, appearance, design, scale and site coverage would constitute a visually ad-hoc, incongruous and cramped development to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the adjoining terrace as well as that of the surrounding area and street scene. As such, it is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposal by reason of insufficient private amenity space would provide substandard accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity. By reason of its proposed balconies and their close proximity to no. 28 Whitehall Road, it would also result in undue overlooking and privacy issues in relation to that property. As such, it is contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
