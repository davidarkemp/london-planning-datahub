    "The proposed development by reason of design, scale, bulk, massing, siting and roof forms would result in a form of overdevelopment of the subject site which would adversely affect the character of the original dwellinghouse as well as the character of the area and the visual amenity of the street scene. As such the proposal would be contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed development by reason of scale, bulk, massing, siting and roof forms would result in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development that would have an increased sense of enclosure upon No. 47 Burns Avenue.  As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at No. 47 Burns Avenue would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal, contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
