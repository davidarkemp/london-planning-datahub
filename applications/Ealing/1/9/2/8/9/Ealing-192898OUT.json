    "The proposed access would not be sufficiently sized to enable vehicles to access and egress in a forward gear as well as provide safe pedestrian routes to and within the site, to the detriment of highway safety, and the proposed vehicle access way through the site would result in amenity impacts on neighbouring properties.  As such, the proposed development would not comply with policies 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.13 and 7.14 of the London Plan (2016); and policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD | Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed height, scale and bulk of a three storey building containing nine self-contained flats can be accommodated on the site without detrimentally harming the character of the area, the visual amenity of the street scene or the residential amenity of neighbouring properties, and provide high quality living conditions for the future occupants.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019); policies 3.5, 7A, 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and policies 3.5, 7.4 , 7.6 and 7.14 of the London Plan (2016)."
