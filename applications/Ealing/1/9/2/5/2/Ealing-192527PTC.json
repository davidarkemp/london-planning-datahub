  "description": "Reapplication due to expired time (over 2 years) on approval of completing works, Ealing Planning ref: 162489PT6 approved 20.06.2016 . The proposed tree works to the rear of the property are all regarding trees with no amenity value and involve the crown reduction of overgrown trees. Removal of two trees already undertaken from approval given for T5 & T6 under building planning application PP 2015/4684.\nT1: Laylandi - This tree has no amenity value. This tree is growing too close to the large Cherry tree with many branches entangled affecting both the health and spread\nof the Cherry - The proposed works to this 10 meter tree include crown reduction of about 40-50% bringing the overall height of the tree to 5 meters.\nT2: Laylandi -This tree has no amenity value. This laylandi has suffered a great deal from the removal of branches that encroached on neighboring properties, possibly following storm damage leaving the tree scared, unsightly and thinned.\nThe proposed works include crown reduction of about 40-50% (current height 11 meters) bringing the overall height of the tree to 5-7 meters.  This reduction will maintain the screening the tree provides but allow more light into the neighboring garden and help the overall look of the tree as well as allow trees close by to flourish (e.g. T3 Pear).\nT3: Pear tree:Minimal crown reduction, reducing height by 2-3 meters to from 10 to 8 meters to ensure the continued health of this fruit tree.\nT7: Elder:\nMinimal crown reduction from 7 meters to 3.5 meters to encourage healthy new growth and maintain attractive form.\nT8: Cherry tree:\nThis mature Cherry has grown lopsided due to the Laylandi (T1) that encroaches on its space. This tree would benefit from crown reduction from 10 meters to\n5 meters to encourage healthy growth, flowering, fruiting and maintain attractive form. Reduction and disentanglement of T1 Laylandi should help Cherry\n\n",
