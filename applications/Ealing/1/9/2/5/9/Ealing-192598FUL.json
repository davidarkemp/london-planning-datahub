The development would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies 3.4, 3.5, 7.1, 7.4, 7.6 and 7.15 of the London Plan (2016), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposed development due to insufficient and poor quality private amenity space and obscure glazed windows resulting in a single aspect/poor outlook dwelling would result in detrimentally substandard living conditions for prospective occupants, contrary to Policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
