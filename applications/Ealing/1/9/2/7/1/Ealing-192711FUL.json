    "The constructed rear roof extension by reason of its design, scale and bulk, expanding for the entire width of the rear roof slope, would represent an incongruous and overbearing development to the detriment of the character of the area.  Thus the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019); policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan; policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy; and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | There is no sectional plan so it cannot be reasonably proven that 75% of the proposed floor to ceiling height of the new self-contained flat would be in compliance with the required 2.3m. It would therefore cause significant harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers and would be contrary to planning policies such as 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. It would also be contrary to the Technical Housing Standards."
