    "The development by reason of the cumulative impact of the extensions; its design, scale, appearance, materials and would result in an incongruous addition to the original property which would be to the detriment of the character of the dwellinghouse and the area. As such, the development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), and Interim Planning Guidance SPD4. | The proposed development by reason of its siting and excessive depth would result in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development that would have an unduly detrimental impact of the amenities of the adjoining property, Nos. 76&80 Ennismore Avenue, with regard to the outlook from their rear elevation and garden and overshadowing. This is contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
