As such, it is considered the proposed development would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan, policies 1.1 (g), 1.1 (h) and 1.2 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy, policies 7A, 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and SPD4 (2004) and is therefore recommended for refusal."
