    "The proposed increase in height of the main roof ridge as well as the size, scale and design of the dormer window to the rear elevation would be incongruous and discordant features within this location. They would unduly draw the eye and go against the pattern of development. The proposal would therefore cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area contrary to policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy, policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan"
