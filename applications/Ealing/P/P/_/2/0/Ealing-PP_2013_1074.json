Development shall be carried out in accordance with these approved details.  Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012)  and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | No development shall take place until full details of both hard and soft landscape works, including a phased programme of works, details of boundary treatment, replanting of ten (10) trees along the boundary of the site within the park (Robina Pseudoacacia with a girth size of 16-18cm and a minimum height of 5m at planting), and details of landscape management for a minimum period of 5 years from the implementation of final planting have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. These works shall be carried out as approved prior to the occupation of any part of the development or in accordance with the programme agreed by the Local Planning Authority.  Any trees or other plants which die or are removed within the first five years following the implementation of the landscaping scheme shall be replaced during the next planting season.  Reason: To ensure that the development is landscaped in the interests of the visual character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policies 5.10 and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | No trees, shrubs or hedges within the site or within the adjacent Acton Park which are shown to be retained on the plans shall be felled, uprooted, willfully damaged or destroyed, cut back in any way or removed without previous written consent of the Local Planning Authority.  Any shrubs or hedges removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming seriously diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced with shrubs or hedge plants or similar species capable of achieving a comparable size unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.  Any trees removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming seriously diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced in accordance with trees, shrubs or hedge plants of similar size and species unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.   Reason: To secure protection of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within the site which are of amenity value to the area in accordance with policies 3.5, 5.10 and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | No operations (including initial site clearance) shall commence on site in connection with development hereby approved until a suitable scheme (Arboricultural Method Statement) for the protection of existing trees, shrubs and hedgerows within Acton Park has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  All protection measures must fully detail each phase of the development process taking into account demolition/site clearance works, all construction works and hard and soft landscaping works.  Details shall include the following:    -Full survey of all trees on site and those within influencing distance on adjacent sites in accordance with BS5837 (using the most recent revision of the standard), with tree works proposals.  All trees must be plotted on a site plan (minimum scale 1:200), clearly and accurately depicting trunk locations, root protection areas and canopy spreads; - A plan (minimum scale of 1:200) detailing all trees, shrubs, hedges planned for retention and removal; - Soil assessments/survey and soil remediation plans; - Timing and phasing of works; - Site specific demolition and hard surface removal specifications;  - Site specific construction specifications;  - Access arrangements and car parking, level changes and landscaping proposals; - A Tree protection plan (minimum scale of 1:200) in accordance with BS5837 (most recent revision of the standard) detailing all methods of protection, including but not restricted to: locations of construction exclusion zones, root protection areas, fit for purpose fencing and ground protection, service routes, works access space, material/machinery/waste storage and permanent & temporary hard surfaces.     All tree protection methods detailed in the approved Arboricultural Method Statement shall not be moved or removed, temporarily or otherwise, until all works including external works have been completed and all equipment, machinery and surplus materials have been removed from the  site, unless the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority has first been sought and obtained.   Reason: To secure the protection, throughout the time that the development is being carried out, of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within or adjacent to the site which are of amenity value to the area in accordance with policies 5.10 and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | No operations (including initial site clearance) shall commence on site in connection with development until a suitable program of monitoring of all approved tree protection measures has been submitted and approved by the Local Planning Authority.  The monitoring program shall include: confirmation of who shall be the lead arboriculturalist for the development, confirmation of the Site Manager, key personnel, their key responsibilities and contact details, details of induction procedures for all personnel in relation to Arboricultural matters, a detailed timetable of events concerning the approved tree protection plans, including; initial implementation of the protective measures, the final removal of the protective measures and any incursion/alterations to accommodate site specific construction/demolition procedures as approved in the Arboricultural Method Statement and the level of supervision required, procedures for dealing with variations or non-approved incursions into the construction exclusion zones as detailed in the approved Arboricultural Method Statement, agreements of when site monitoring will take place with the local Tree Officer either by site meetings or by some other pre-arranged agreement and post development assessment of the retained and planted trees and any necessary remedial action.  The program of Arboricultural monitoring shall be taken in full compliance with the approved details.  No variation of the approved monitoring program shall take place without the prior written agreement of the Local Planning Authority.    Reason: In order to safeguard trees and other vegetation considered to be worthy of retention in the interests of visual amenity for the area in accordance with policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | No development shall take place until there has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority a plan indicating the positions, design, materials and type of boundary treatment (including any internal boundary fences / walls) to be erected.

This assessment must be undertaken by a competent person, and shall assess any contamination on the site, whether or not it originates on the site. The report of the findings must include:   (i) a survey of the extent, scale and nature of contamination;  (ii) an assessment of the potential risks to:-  -human health,  -property (existing or proposed) including buildings, pets, and service lines and pipes,  -adjoining land,  -groundwaters and surface waters,   (iii) An appraisal of remedial options, and proposal of the preferred option(s).
