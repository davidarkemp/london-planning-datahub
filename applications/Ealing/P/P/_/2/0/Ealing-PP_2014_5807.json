    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title number 7014/20 B, 7014/21 B, 7014/22 B, 7014/23 B, 7014/24 B, 7014/25 B, 7014/26 B, 7014/27 B, 7014/28 B, 7014/29 B and 7014/30 B.  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.  Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Adopted Ealing Development Management Plan, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and The London Plan (2013) policy 7.4. | Before any part of the development hereby permitted is first occupied arrangements shall have been made to secure a car-free development in accordance with a detailed scheme or agreement which has been approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved scheme or agreement must ensure that:  a) all occupiers of the approved upstairs flats cannot apply for, obtain or hold an on-street parking permit to park a vehicle on the public highway within the administrative district of the local planning authority (other than a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 or similar legislation); b) all occupiers of the upstairs flats are required to surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held; and c) such a scheme or agreement shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be retained and operated for so long as the use hereby permitted continues.  Reason: To ensure that proposal does not exacerbate on-street parking pressure in the local controlled parking zone, in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policy 6.13 and policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2011. | The proposed upper floor side facing windows shall contain only obscure glass (minimum level 3 obscure glazed) and non-opening unless the parts of the window can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the rooms in which the windows are installed. The window so approved shall be retained permanently.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of neighbouring properties and the visual appearance of the area, in accordance with policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2011)."
