    "The proposed mansard roof extension would introduce a prominent feature which would fail to relate to the size, scale and design of adjoining buildings and therefore the overall street scene which would equate to an incongruous addition that would be out of keeping with the existing pattern of development, to the detriment of the host building and the character and appearance of the Acton Town Centre Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), Ealing Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (July 2012) and the Draft Ealing Development Management Development Plan Documents Ealing Local Variation to Policy 7.4 - Local Character. | The proposed mansard roof extension, by virtue of its size and scale would constitute an overly dominant and enclosing development which would impact the outlook from first floor windows to the rear of number 23 Horn Lane to the detrimental of the amenities of this occupier. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), Ealing Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the London Plan (July 2012) and the Draft Ealing Development Management Development Plan Documents Ealing Local Variation to Policy 7.4 - Local Character."
