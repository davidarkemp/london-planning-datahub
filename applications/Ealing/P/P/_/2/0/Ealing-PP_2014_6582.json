    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans and documents: Drawings: 5965/E/001, 5965/E/002 Rev. A, 5965/E/003 Rev. A, 5965/E/004 Rev. A, 5965/E/005 Rev. A, 5965/E/006 Rev. A, 5965/P/002, 5965/P/003, 5965/P/004, 5965/P/005, 5965/P/006, 001 Rev a (including Tree Schedule from Wharton Arboriculture Ltd), received 24/12/2014, 5965/P/001 Rev. E, received 30/11/2015. Design & Access Statement dated December 2014, received 24/12/2014, Energy Statement by Energy Council, BREEAM Pre-Assessment by Energy Council dated 19/06/2015, Transport and Travel Plan Statement by Amec Foster Wheeler Environment & Infrastructure UK Limited (additional/revised info received from John Hayland on 24/12/2015.  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | Prior to the commencement of the development, details of a site construction method statement shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The submission shall include the following:  a.\tDetails of the number of on-site construction workers and of the transport options for them; b.\tanticipated route, anticipated number, frequency and size of construction vehicles entering/exiting the site per day; c.\tdelivery times and booking system; d.\troute and location of site access for construction traffic and associated signage based on the construction vehicle access and egress routes; e.\tmanagement of consolidated or re-timed trips; f.\tan Air Quality Dust Management Plan that includes an Air Quality (Dust) Risk Assessment and details of noise/vibration mitigation measures and monitoring arrangements for noise, vibration and dust by suitably qualified noise and air quality specialists.  Noise / vibration and dust mitigation measures must accord with the Mayor's SPG 'The control of dust and emissions from construction and demolition ' (2014); BS 5228 Parts 1 & 2; the Institute of Air Quality Management 'Guidance on the assessment of dust from demolition and construction'; g.\tdetails of site security and the erection and maintenance of security hoarding including decorative displays and facilities for public viewing, where appropriate; h.\tsecure, off-street loading and drop-off facilities; i.\tvehicle manoeuvring and turning, including swept path diagrams to demonstrate how construction vehicles will access the site and be able to turn into and emerge from the site in forward gear and including details of any temporary vehicle access points; j.\tdetails of the location for storage of building materials and construction debris and contractors offices; k.\tprocedures for on-site contractors to deal with complaints from members of the public; l.\tmeasures to consult cyclists, disabled people and the local schools (including Gifford Primary School) with regard  to delivery times and necessary diversions; m.\tdetails of all pedestrian and cyclist diversions; n.\ta commitment to be part of Considerate Constructors Scheme; and o.\tconfirmation of use of TfL's Freight Operator Recognition Scheme (FORS) or similar.   Prior to the commencement of any site work, all sensitive properties within or surrounding the site shall be notified in writing of the nature and duration of the works to be undertaken, and the name and address of a responsible person to whom enquiries / complaints should be directed. These details shall also be displayed at regular intervals around the site compound. The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the approved details.  Reason:  To ensure that appropriate mitigation measures are put in place to protect the amenity of local residents that live in close proximity to the demolition and construction site and to ensure adequate highway and site safety, in accordance with policies 5.3, 5.18, 6.3, 7.14, 7.15 and 7.19 of the London Plan (2015); policies 1.1(e), 1.1(f) and 1.1(j) of Ealing's Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); policy 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013); (Interim) SPG 10: Noise and Vibration; the National Planning Policy Framework (2012); the Greater London Authority SPG 'The Control of Dust and Emissions from Construction and Demolition' (2014), BS 5228-1:2009 - Code of practice for noise & vibration control on construction & open sites-Part 1: Noise. | The trees, shrubs and hedgerows as set out on drawings 5965/P/001 Rev. E, received 24/12/2015 shall be retained as part of the development. The trees shall be fully protected in accordance with a Tree Protection Plan ** in accordance with BS5837* to be submitted and approved in writing by the local planning authority detailing all methods of protection, including but not restricted to: locations of construction exclusion zones, root protection areas, fit for purpose fencing and ground protection, service routes, works access space, material/machinery/waste storage and permanent & temporary hard surfaces.    All tree protection methods detailed in the approved Tree protection Plan shall not be moved or removed, temporarily or otherwise, until all works associated with that approved development have been completed and all equipment, machinery and surplus materials have been removed from the site, unless the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority has first been sought and obtained.   *Using the most recent revision the of the Standard ** Plans must be of a minimum scale of 1:200 (unless otherwise agreed by the Local Planning Authority)  Reason: Details of the Tree Protection Plan and a programme of monitoring the tree works are required prior to the commencement of any site preparation works because such works would carry a high risk of damaging trees and other vegetation particularly by site operatives that are not experienced to carry out works around trees. The protection of trees and other vegetation is required in accordance with policies 7.19 and 7.21 of the London Plan 2015, and interim SPG 9 'Trees and Development Guidelines'. The tree protection measures shall be retained throughout the demolition of existing buildings and construction of the approved development, in accordance with the recommendations in BS5837 (2012). | Hard and soft landscaping (including shared surface treatments), the equipped play areas and boundary treatments that are detailed within the approved Design and Access Statement and illustrated on drawings ref: 5965/P/001 Rev. E, received 30/12/2015, shall be installed prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved to which the landscaping, equipped play areas and boundary treatments form part. Any alteration or change from the approved details shall be approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the implementation of the relevant works.    All soft landscaping shall be carried out in the earliest planting season (1st October to 31st March inclusive). The quality of all approved landscape works shall be in accordance with British Standard 4428:1989 'Code of Practice for General Landscape Operations' or any subsequent revision.  All trees included within the approved scheme shall be healthy, well-formed specimens with single leading shoots and shall be of a minimum quality compatible with British Standard 3936:1992 (Part 1) 'Specifications For Trees & Shrubs' and British Standard 4043 (where applicable) or any subsequent revisions and BS8545:2014 Trees: from nursery to independence in the landscape.  Any trees that within a period of 5 years from the completion of all tree planting, that die, are removed, uprooted, are significantly damaged, become diseased or malformed shall be replaced during the nearest planting season (1st October to 31st March inclusive) with others of the same size, species and quality as approved.   The approved landscaping, play areas and boundary treatments shall be retained thereafter and maintained in perpetuity.    Reason: To ensure that the development is landscaped in the interests of the positive visual character and appearance of the area; to ensure that the necessary boundary treatments are incorporated into the development in the interests of meeting the Secured by Design principles; in order to ensure that the site landscaping is provided in a timely fashion; and in order to provide a good level of privacy for future occupants, in accordance with policies LV2.18, LV7.3, LV7.4, 7B and 7D of Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013); policies 2.18, 7.4, 7.13, 7.19 and 7.21 of the London Plan (2015); policies 1.1(h) and (i), 2.10, 5.3, 5.4 and 6.3 of Ealing's Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), and interim SPG 9 'Trees and Development Guidelines'. | The 13 nos. car parking spaces (including disabled car parking spaces) shown on the approved plan reference (Ref: 5965/P/001 Rev. E), received 30/12/2015, shall be laid out prior to first occupation of any of the unit hereby permitted and permanently retained without obstruction.  Reason: To ensure that there is adequate provision for car parking within the site in accordance with policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2015). | The active charging points for electric vehicles shown on the approved drawing (Ref: 5965/P/001 Rev.
