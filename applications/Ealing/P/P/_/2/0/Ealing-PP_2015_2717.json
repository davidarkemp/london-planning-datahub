    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plan: 13 (Rev: B), 14 (Rev: B) and 15 (Rev: A).  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the existing materials and those as described on the plans.  Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies LV 7.4, 7B and 7C, policies 1.1 (g) (h), 1.2 (g) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan Consolidated (2015). | No part of the roof of the single storey rear extension shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of neighbouring properties and the visual appearance of the area, in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies LV 7.4 and 7B, policies 1.1 (h) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan Consolidated (2015). | The applicant shall provide the new crossover to the site with a 1.5m x 1.5m pedestrian visibility splay with no obstruction above 0.6m from ground level on either side of the access.  Reason: In the interests of  highway safety, in accordance with  policy 6.3 of the London Plan 2015, 1.1 (f) of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and the SPG - Sustainable Transport for New Development. | Provision for cycle storage in accordance with adopted standards shall be provided and be continuously available and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.  Reason: To provide adequate bicycle storage to align with adopted Sustainable Transport SPG and policy 6.9 of the London Plan Consolidated (2015). | Before any part of the development hereby approved is first occupied, arrangements shall have been made to secure a car-free development for three of the flats, in accordance with a detailed scheme or agreement which has been approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved scheme or agreement must ensure that:  a) all occupiers of the approved dwelling cannot apply for, obtain or hold an on-street parking permit to park a vehicle on the public highway within the administrative district of the local planning authority (other than a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 or similar legislation); b) all occupiers of the flat are required to surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held; and, c) such a scheme or agreement shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be retained and operated for so long as the use hereby permitted continues.  Reason: To ensure that the development is car-free and does not exacerbate on-street parking pressure in the local controlled parking zone in accordance with policy 6.13 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document, policies 1.1 (f) (g) of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 6.3 and 6.13 of the London Plan - Consolidated (2015). | Prior to commencement of construction and demolition works a detailed Construction Method Statement shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.
