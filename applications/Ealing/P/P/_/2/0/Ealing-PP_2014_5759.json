    "The proposed extension, by reason of its bulk and scale would represent an incongruous enlargement that would fail to be a subordinate addition and be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original building and prevailing pattern of development in the area. As such, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan DPD (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011) and the adopted Supplementary Planning Document 04 'Residential Extensions'."
