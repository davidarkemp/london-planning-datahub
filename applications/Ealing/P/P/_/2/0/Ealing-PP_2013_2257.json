Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Samples of the materials to be used for the external surfaces of the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any part of the development is commenced, and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application.  Development shall be carried out in accordance with these approved details.  REASON:\tTo ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 4.1, 5.5 & 5.9 of the Adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment'(2004), policies 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2011) and SPD 4: Residential Extensions. | Covered and secure cycle parking for two bicycles shall be provided prior to first occupation of the development, and shall be retained thereafter.  Reason: To provide adequate cycle facilities and to promote sustainable patterns of transport, in accordance with policies 9.1 and 9.6 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan. | Covered and secure refuse and recycling storage shall be constructed prior to occupation of the residential flats.  Such provision shall be retained permanently.    REASON:\tTo provide adequate waste and recycling facilities in the interests of the environment and visual amenity of the locality and to protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area, in accordance with policies 2.10, 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Guidance 4 'Refuse and Recycling Facilities'. | Prior to occupation of the subject site, arrangements shall be agreed in writing with the local planning authority (legal agreement) and be put in place to ensure that, with the exception of disabled persons, no resident of the units hereby approved shall obtain a resident's parking permit (including visitors permit's) within any controlled parking zone which may be in force in the area at any time. The professional and legal fees incurred by the Council in drafting and completing the agreement shall be met by the applicant/owner.
