    "The proposed development, by reason of its proximity and poor interface with commercial development at the rear of Park Parade, would fail to provide good living conditions for future residents due to the potential for disturbance from commercial activities and vehicles servicing the commercial premises in Park Parade. As such, the proposal would conflict with the requirements of policies 7A and 7B of the adopted Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policies 3.5 and 7.15 of The London Plan (2015). | The proposed development, by virtue of its unsafe pedestrian access to the site and potential for conflict between future pedestrians movements and commercial traffic servicing the rear of Park Parade, would compromise the safety of future occupiers due to the poor and unsafe access arrangements to the new dwellings and the vehicle and pedestrian movements associated with the existing and proposed uses to be serviced by the narrow access lane. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies 6.3, 6.10 and 7.4 of The London Plan (2015)."
