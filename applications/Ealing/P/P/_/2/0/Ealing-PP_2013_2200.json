Within 3 months of the construction of the development details of 'Interim Design Stage' assessments and related certification shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Following the completion of the final residential unit and prior to the first occupation of the development Code for Sustainable Homes 'Post Construction Stage' assessments shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Thereafter within 6 months of the date of the first occupation of the development Post-Construction Stage Certificates verified by the BRE confirming the agreed sustainability measures and Code Level have been achieved shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.

This reduction should be calculated based on carbon dioxide emissions covered by the Building Regulations whilst carbon dioxide emissions associated with other energy uses not covered by Building Regulations (un-regulated) should be also included and measures to reduce them should be demonstrated. Relevant section/clauses of the green lease agreement for the non-residential element should be also submitted to supplement the energy strategy. Energy Performance Certificates [EPC's] and modelling output reports from the \"as built stage\" to confirm compliance in terms of savings achieved through energy efficiency measures should also be submitted. The development shall be implemented only in accordance with the approved details, which shall be completed prior to the first occupation of the flats hereby approved and thereafter permanently retained and maintained, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.   Reason: To ensure that the development hereby approved is energy efficient and to contribute to the avoidance of need for new fossil fuel or other primary energy generation capacity and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in accordance with policies 1.1, & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy LV 5.2 of the Ealing Draft Development Management Development Plan Document (2013),  policies  5.1-5.7 of the London Plan (2011), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | Upon final completion of the development, suitable devices for the monitoring of the renewable/low-carbon energy equipment shall have been installed, and the monitored data shall be submitted to the local planning authority at daily intervals for a period of three years from final completion.
