Reason: To promote sustainable transport and highways safety in line with London Plan coach parking standards (6A.9) and policy 4.5, Development Strategy policy 1.1(f) and NPPF Chapter 4 (Promoting Sustainable Transport). | A delivery and servicing plan (DSP) for the development detailing servicing arrangements, times and frequency and operational details of the layby shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the first occupation of the development. The servicing of the development shall be operated strictly in accordance with the details so approved, shall be maintained as such thereafter and no change therefrom shall take place without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority obtained through the submission of a planning application.  Reason: To ensure that the resulting servicing arrangements are satisfactory in terms of their impact on adjoining uses and highway safety and the free-flow of traffic in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) (f) (j) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy 6.3 of the London Plan 2015. | Within 3 months of occupation of the development, a travel plan designed to manage the transport needs of staff and visitors, to minimise car usage and promote alternative modes of transport, shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The approved Travel Plan shall be implemented once approved and shall be permanently retained in operation for the life of the development.  Reason: To limit the impact of the proposal on the highway network in accordance with policies, 6.3 6.11 and 6.12 the London Plan 2015. | Notwithstanding condition number 1 of this approval, this planning permission shall not be implemented either fully or partly, unless the construction of the hotel use approved under planning permission ref: PP/2013/5688 dated 01/05/2014 has commenced prior to the commencement of the development hereby approved.  Reason: In the interests of proper planning and to prevent the implementation of an incomplete development in accordance with policies 1.1(h) and 2.1(c) of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2015) and policy 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document 2013."
