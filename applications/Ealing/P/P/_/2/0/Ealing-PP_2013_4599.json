    "The proposed development would, as a consequence of the external rear access to and from the first floor flat, result in noise and disturbance to and overlooking of the adjacent property at 94 Costons Lane. This would be detrimental to the residential amenities of the occupiers of that dwelling. The proposed development is therefore contrary to policies policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), policy 7B of the Development Management Development Management Document (February 2013), policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2011) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | By virtue of its location at the rear of the curtilage of the plot, and the proposed long, narrow access to it, the proposed amenity space for the first floor flat would be unacceptable and would not provide a suitable or desirable garden area for the occupiers of that flat. Accordingly, the development is contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), policy 7B of the Development Management Development Management Document (February 2013) and policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2011) and the National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012)."
