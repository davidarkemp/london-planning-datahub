    "The proposed side and rear wrap around extension, by virtue of its bulk and scale would be an excessive overdevelopment of the original dwelling house, the extension would not appear subordinate to the original dwelling house and would constitute an incongruous form of development that would adversely impact on the character of the original building and detract from the area.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.4 & 7.6 of The London Plan (2015); 7.4 & 7B of Ealing's Adopted DPD (2013); 1.1(g), 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Local Development Framework - Adopted Core Strategy (2012) and supplementary planning guidance as contained in Supplementary Planning Document 4: ' Residential Extensions' (2006)."
