All protection measures must fully detail each phase of the development process taking into account demolition/site clearance works, all construction works and hard and soft landscaping works.  Details shall include the following:    -Full survey of all trees on site and those within influencing distance on adjacent sites in accordance with BS5837 (using the most recent revision of the standard), with tree works proposals.

All tree protection methods detailed in the approved Arboricultural Method Statement shall not be moved or removed, temporarily or otherwise, until all works including external works have been completed and all equipment, machinery and surplus materials have been removed from the  site.   Reason: To secure the protection, throughout the time that the development is being carried out, of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within or adjacent to the site which are of amenity value to the area in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 1.2 (d) of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012), 5.10 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan and policy 5.10 of the London Plan (2015). | No development shall commence until a detailed scheme of proposed tree planting has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Every tree to be removed should be replaced with a new tree on site.  The scheme shall include the following comprehensive details of all trees to be planted:  Full planting specification - Tree size, species and the numbers of trees; positions of all proposed species; comprehensive details of ground preparation; staking/tying method(s); and 5 year post planting maintenance schedule with an agreed inspection schedule.
