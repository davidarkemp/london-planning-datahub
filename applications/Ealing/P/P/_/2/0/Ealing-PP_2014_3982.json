As such, the proposal is contrary to sections 7 and 8 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.1 and 7.6 of The London Plan 2011 policies 1.1 (e) (h), 3.1 (b) and 3.8 of the Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy, policies ELV 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing's Development Management Development Plan (2013) and the advice contained in the interim Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2004)."
