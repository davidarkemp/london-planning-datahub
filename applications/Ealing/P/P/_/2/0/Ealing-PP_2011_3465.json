    "The proposed outbuilding, due to its size and scale and the associated reduction in garden area in comparison to the level of built development on the site, would produce an inappropriate development harmful to the character and setting of parent Grade II Listed Building, Pine Cottage, and would  detract from its special architectural or historic interest. As such, the proposal is contrary to the requirements of Planning Policy Statement 5: 'Planning for the Historic Environment' and policies 4.6 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The proposed outbuilding, due to its size and scale, would be out of character with the general style and pattern of development in the area,  harmful to visual amenity and would cause harm to the character and appearance of the Ealing Green Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to the advice contained within the Council's adopted Ealing Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and the requirements of policies 4.8 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004)."
