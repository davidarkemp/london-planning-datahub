    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title number Design and Access Statement, A/P_200A, A/P_201A, A/P_202B, A/P_203B, A/P_210B, A/P_211A, A/P_212A.  .  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the existing materials and those as described on the plans, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies LV 7.4 and 7B, policies 1.1, and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | The proposed windows and glazing on the southern side elevation shall contain only obscure glass and shall remain non-opening unless the parts of the window can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the rooms in which the windows are installed. The window so approved shall be retained permanently.
