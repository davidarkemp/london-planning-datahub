    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title number(s) P-1201-001-A, P-1201-003-A, P-1201-004-A, P-1201-005-A, P-1201-007-A, P-1201-008-A, and P-1201-009-A, received 20th February 2012, and as amended P-1201-002-A Rev A, P-1201-006-A Rev A, received 16th April 2012, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.   Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, in the interest of proper planning, and to ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 4.1, and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), and London Plan (July 2011) policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6. | Notwithstanding the details shown on the plans, all external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.  Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 4.1, 5.5, and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), and London Plan (July 2011) policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6. | Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, as amended by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 2) (England) Order 2008, no windows or other openings (other than those shown on the submitted plans) shall be formed in the walls or roof of the building permitted.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of neighbouring properties and the visual appearance of the original property and the surrounding area, in accordance with policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); and Supplementary Planning Document 4: Residential Extensions, and London Plan (July 2011) policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6. | Details in line with the criteria specified in Supplementary Planning Guidance 10 shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority, including, as appropriate, the noise exposure on the proposed rear building envelope from the near-by commercial uses.  The details shall also include the noise mitigation measures with windows closed and other means of ventilation provided.  Such details as approved shall be permanently retained.  Reason: In the interests of the amenity of occupants of the proposed residential units, and in accordance with policies 4.1 and 4.11 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained within the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance note 10: 'Noise and Vibration', and London Plan (July 2011) policy 7.15. | Details of secure cycle storage for the first/second floor level unit shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. Such details as approved shall be implemented prior to the first occupation of any of the residential units and thereafter permanently retained, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To ensure that there is adequate provision for cycle parking, in accordance with policy 9.6 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The existing garage shown on drawing No. P-1201-002-A shall be retained solely for the parking of vehicles for domestic purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the ground floor level unit, and not for any separate residential use or for any industrial, commercial or business use.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of occupiers of neighbouring properties, in accordance with policy 9.1 of the Unitary Development Plan (Plan for the Environment) (2004), and London Plan (July 2011) policy 6.3."
