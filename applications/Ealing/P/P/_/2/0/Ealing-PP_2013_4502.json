    "By virtue of its height, bulk and massing in this prominent location, the proposed shed would have a significant and detrimental visual impact on the street scene and would neither preserve nor enhance the character or appearance of the Cuckoo Estate Conservation Area.  It would, at 3.3m high, be more than twice the height of existing sheds on the site and by virtue of the lack of screening for the shed, it would appear as a discordant feature within this attractive, relatively enclosed corner of the street scene. As such, the proposed shed is contrary to Interim Guidance 4, policies 1.1 (g) and (h) of the Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011). | By virtue of the proximity of the proposed shed to the neighbouring property at 3 Lile Crescent and the presence of a glazed door and window in this dwelling immediately adjacent to the site of the propsoed shed, the shed, of the size, bulk and massing proposed, would have an adverse impact upon the levels of light reaching this neighbouring dwelling, the outlook from the property and the residential amenities of the occupiers of the dweling. The shed would be overbearing and visually intrusive when viewed from this property and accordingly, is contrary to Interim Guidance 4, policy 1.1 (g) of the Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A and 7B of the Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | By virtue of its proposed height, bulk and massing and close relationship with the existing dwelling on the site, the proposed shed would appear as a discordant, prominent and visually intrusive addition to the site that would not sit comfortably with, or have an acceptable relationship with, the existing dwelling on the site. The shed would not be of an appropriate scale for the dwelling or the site and, in this prominent location, would be out of keeping with the site. Accordingly, the proposed shed is contrary to Interim Guidance 4, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011)."
