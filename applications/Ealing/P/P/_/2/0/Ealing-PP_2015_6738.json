As such, it is considered contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2015, policies 1.1 (h), 1.2 (g) and 3.1(b) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy, policy 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and the advice contained in the interim Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2004) and the Old Oak Lane Conservation Area Conservation Area Management Plan."
