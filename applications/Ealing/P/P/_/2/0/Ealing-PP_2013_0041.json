    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title number(s) Design and Access Statement, Location Plan, A101, and A102, received 7th January 2013, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.       Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, in the interest of proper planning. | Notwithstanding the details shown on the plans, all external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.  Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 4.1, and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); DM DPD Policy 7B Design Amenity; London Plan (July 2011) policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6; and National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | The new residential units hereby permitted shall be constructed to Lifetime Homes standards prior to their first occupation and shall be retained as such thereafter.    Reason: To ensure access for all for future occupiers in accordance with policy 5.3 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan (Plan for the Environment 2004) and London Plan policy 7.2. | No part of the roof of the extension shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.  Reason:  To protect the living conditions of occupants of nearby properties in accordance with Policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the Adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); Supplementary Planning Document 4: Residential Extensions, adopted Development (or Core) Stategy (April 2012); London Plan (July 2011) policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6; and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | Details of cycle storage for the first/second floor level flat shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any part of the development is commenced, and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application. Development shall be carried out in accordance with these approved details.   Reason: To encourage green modes of transport and reduce the development's impact on the public highway, in accordance with policy 9.1 of the Unitary Development Plan (Plan for the Environment) (2004), and London Plan (July 2011) policies 6.3 and 6.9. | All window openings on the flank elevations of the dwellings hereby approved shall contain only obscure glass, and shall be fixed shut, and shall thereafter be retained permanently as such.
