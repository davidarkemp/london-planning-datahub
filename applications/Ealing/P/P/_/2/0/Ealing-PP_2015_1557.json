The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy 3.5 of the London Plan, Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD, the Mayor's Housing SPG and the Technical Housing Standards. | The proposed two-storey rear extension, by reason of its design, bulk, depth, scale and height, would be an incongruous and discordant form of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area and the amenity of the occupants of nos. 177 and 181. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan, Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and SPD4 (Residential Extensions)."
