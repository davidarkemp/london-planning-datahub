    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, bulk and position, would result in an incompatible and obtrusive form of development, which would be overly dominant and fail to be adequately subservient to the host building, and would adversely affect the character and appearance of the building, streetscene, and area generally.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Core Strategy, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2011, and SPD4 - Residential Extensions."
