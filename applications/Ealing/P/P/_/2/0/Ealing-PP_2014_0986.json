    "The proposed development by reason of its appearance, design and roof profile would result in an intensive development that is out of keeping with the character of development in the area, and would also be visually incongruous and overbearing to the detriment of the visual and residential character of the locality as a whole, contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.1 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2011), The London Plan Housing SPG, policies 1.1 (g), 1.2 (h) and 2.1(c) of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed rear extension due its siting, massing, height and unsatisfactory relationship with the neighbouring property at no. 24 Osterley Park Road would have a harmful effect on the residential amenity presently enjoyed by its occupiers by reason of its overbearing appearance and sense of enclosure the scale and footprint of the extension would cause. As such the proposal is considered to be contrary section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.1, 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2011), The London Plan Housing SPG, policies 1.1 (e and g), 1.2 (h), and 2.1(c) of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policy 7.B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed accommodation, by reason of the unbalanced mix of units, the provision of separate units within the roofspace with insufficient usable internal floorspace, the provision of single aspect north facing units which would be provided with poor light and outlook, the provision of ground floor units with small side facing windows providing poor light and outlook and the lack of external amenity space provision would all result in the provision of inadequate living conditions to the detriment of the amenity of the future occupiers of the development contrary to section 6 of the National Planning Policy Framework,  policies 3.5, 3.8,  7.1 and 7.4 of the London Plan (2011), The London Plan Housing SPG, and policy 7.B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed development by reason of the lack of suitable vehicular access and the off street parking arrangement requiring the provision of a crossover of 7.2m wide would represent a hazard for highway users. As such the proposal would fail to comply with the objectives of section 4 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 6.3 & 6.13 of the London Plan, and policy 6.13 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
