    "The proposed conversion to form four self-contained flats is considered to represent overintensive development of the site. The resulting residential units would offer substandard indoor living space for future occupiers in terms of their quality and their size. In particular, the bedroom accommodation within the proposed basement flat would suffer from poor access to natural light, while the second floor flat located in the roof eaves would offer substandard floorspace, resulting from the poor headroom available. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.6 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and to the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Guidance - SPG 14 - Internal Living Space for New Dwellings and Conversions. | The proposal development fails to provide sufficient private usable amenity space for the occupiers of the four proposed flats. As such the proposed development is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.5 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the provisions of Supplementary Planning Guidance 13 'Garden Space'."
