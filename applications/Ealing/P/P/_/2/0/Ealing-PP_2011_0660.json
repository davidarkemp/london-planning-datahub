    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  REASON:\tIn order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title numbers: 228/PA/1.01-X Rev OR, 228/PA/1.01-X Rev OR, 228/PA/1.03-X Rev OR, 228/PA/1.04 X Rev A, 228/PA/1.05 X Rev A, 228/PA/2.01 X Rev A,  228/PA/3.01 X Rev A, 228/PA/3.02 X Rev A (received 14/02/2011) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local Planning Authority.  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Samples of the materials to be used for the external surfaces of the development (including the balconies) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any part of the development is commenced, and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application.  Development shall be carried out in accordance with these approved details.  REASON:\tTo ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 4.1, 4.7 and 5.5 of the Adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment'(2004). | The development will be affected by traffic noise at a level which falls into Category D noise exposure.  Prior to the commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority, for mitigation works to protect sensitive rooms, gardens and balconies from external noise. The criteria to be met and the assessment method shall be that specified in Supplementary Planning Guidance 10.  The details shall also include alternative means of ventilation for noise sensitive rooms, meeting the said criteria. The works, as approved, shall be completed before occupation and thereafter permanently retained.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of adjoining properties and future residential occupiers of the development, in accordance with policies 4.1 and 4.11 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004, Supplementary planning Guidance 10 'Noise and Vibration' and Planning Policy Guidance Note 24 'Planning and Noise'. | Details shall be submitted for the approval of the Local Planning Authority before any development is commenced, to demonstrate that the composite sound reduction index of the building envelope, Rw, will achieve the following criteria with windows shut and other means of ventilation provided: The background L90,15min linear noise level in any one third octave band from 50Hz to 160 Hz, and also the overall Linear L90 level, as previously measured at 1 m from the nearest fatade of the nearest affected premises, shall not be increased when the amplified music or speech is played and the measurement is repeated in the same position, using L90 linear over any 5 minute period with the background and source operating together.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of adjoining properties and future residential occupiers of the development, in accordance with policies 4.1 and 4.11 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004, Supplementary planning Guidance 10 'Noise and Vibration' and Planning Policy Guidance Note 24 'Planning and Noise'. | Notwithstanding any details of the access, and associated gate and lighting shown on the approved drawings: 228/LP/1.01 Rev A, no development shall take place until full details of a scheme of works have been both submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority relating to the improvement of the access way.  Reason: In the interests of pedestrian safety and security, in accordance with policies 4.4 and 9.1 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | Refuse and Recycling Storage shall be implemented as per the approved dwg no. 227/PA/1.01 -X Rev OR (received 14/02/2011) and retained thereafter.  Reason: To safeguard the living and working conditions of neighbouring occupiers and in the interest of the environment, in accordance with policy 2.10 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Guidance 4 - Refuse and Recycling Facilities. | The development hereby approved shall comply with the aims and objectives of the Secured By Design award before the first occupation of the development, and shall be permanently retained as such.  Reason: To ensure that the proposed development achieves the required crime prevention elements as detailed by Government Circular 5/94 'Planning Out Crime', with the requirements of Clause 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which imposes a duty on a Local Authority 'to do all that it can to prevent crime and disorder in its area', and with policy 4.4 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Guidance 8: Safer Ealing."
