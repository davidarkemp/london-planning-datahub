    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title numbers: P001, P002, P003, Design and Access Statement, and Daylight and Sunlight Study (within development).  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Samples of the materials to be used for the external surfaces of the development, including details of the front entrance door, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any part of the development is commenced, and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application.  Development shall be carried out in accordance with these approved details.  Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7A of the adopted Ealing Development Plan Document and policy 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and policy 7.15 of the London Plan (2015). | Before any part of the development hereby permitted is first occupied arrangements shall have been made to secure a car-free development in accordance with a detailed scheme or agreement which has been approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved scheme or agreement must ensure that:  a) all occupiers of the approved flats cannot apply for, obtain or hold an on-street parking permit to park a vehicle on the public highway within the administrative district of the local planning authority (other than a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 or similar legislation); b) all occupiers of the flats are required to surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held; and c) such a scheme or agreement shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be retained and operated for so long as the use hereby permitted continues.
