    "Reason: In the interest of addressing climate change and to secure sustainable development in accordance with policies 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.9 of the London Plan 2016, policies LV5.2 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013, and policies 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2012. | Each residential unit proposed, including both new and refurbished, within the approved development should be registered with the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and constructed to achieve BREEAM Rating Excellent of the BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment Scheme (based on the latest BREEAM Technical guidance).",
    "1A) \tWithin three months of the completion of each residential unit of the development, evidence that the development is registered with Building Research Establishment (BRE) under the BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment Scheme (based on the most up to date BREEAM Technical Guidance) and Interim BREEAM Assessment and related Certification verified by the BRE shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval.",
    "1B) \tWithin three months from the date of first occupation of each residential unit of the development, BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment 'Post Construction Stage' Assessment and related Certification verified by the BRE, should be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval confirming the BREEAM standard and measures have been implemented.",

The details of any additional measures to be incorporated into each non-residential unit to minimise the risk of overheating (without active cooling first) shall also be submitted and evidence that these measures can be incorporated into the development if the dynamic thermal modelling demonstrates that overheating would occur. Compliance with Criterion 3 of the Building Regulations should also be demonstrated. Each residential unit shall thereafter be provided in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason: To ensure that each residential unit within the development hereby approved is energy efficient and to reduce the risk of overheating in line with policy 5.9 of the London Plan 2016, adopted Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2026 (3rd April 2012) and Development Management DPD (December 2013). | A)     \tPrior to commencement of the residential units, other than site preparation, remediation and / or the formation of accesses, a revised report, which includes full details and drawings of the energy saving measures, including passive measures and/or LZC technologies, that are to be incorporated into the development, shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The submitted details shall demonstrate whether the residential component of the development hereby approved will achieve zero carbon in regulated CO2 emissions over and beyond Building Regulations Part L 2013.  In demonstrating compliance with this percentage reduction the applicant should consider the use of measures in line with the Energy Hierarchy including the incorporation of on-site renewables. This reduction should be calculated based on carbon dioxide emissions covered by the Building Regulations. The revised energy strategy shall detail the additional 3.7 kWp of PV.",
    "B)    Within three-months of the first occupation of each dwelling in the approved development, Energy Performance Certificates [EPC's], detailed modelling output reports showing clearly the DER from the \"as built stage\" to confirm compliance in terms of savings achieved through energy efficiency measures should be also submitted for written approval by the Local Authority.",
    "C)     \tWithin three-months of the practical completion of the dwellings, technical information and evidence that the renewable/low carbon technologies are certified under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MSC) and, if appropriate, complies with the Enhanced Capital Allowances (ECS) product criteria should be submitted.",
    "The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved.",
    "Reason:  To ensure that the dwellings within the development hereby approved are energy efficient and to contribute to the avoidance of need for new fossil fuel or other primary energy generation capacity and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality in the interests of health, in accordance with policies 3.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.14 of the London Plan 2016, policies 1.1(e), 1.1(j), 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of Ealing's adopted Development (or Core) Strategy 2012, policies LV5.2 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD, and the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG."
