    "The development by reason of the provision of insufficient and inadequate internal floor space, internal circulation and layout, garden space, light, outlook, privacy, separate and secure access, off-street parking and refuse storage provision for the proposed new residential unit would provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the residential amenities of the future occupiers of the development. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.3 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 3.5, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 of The London Plan (2011), the London Plan Supplementary Planning Guidance and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | The proposed development by the reason of failing to provide adequate off-street car parking in an area of low public transport accessibility is considered to constitute an undesirable form of development which would be likely to exacerbate car parking stress in the area, to the detriment of the amenity of existing residents and to highway safety. As such the proposal is contrary to policy 6.13 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 3.5, 6.1, 6.3 & 6.13 of The London Plan (2011), the London Plan Supplementary Planning Guidance and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
