    "The outbuilding constructed, by way of its design, appearance and excessive scale is an undesirable development of the rear garden of the subject residential property, to the detriment of the character, appearance and setting of the main property and the residential area as a whole, contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan 2015, policies 1.1 (e) (h), 3.1 (b) and 3.8 of the Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy, policies ELV 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing's Development Management Development Plan (2013) and the advice contained in the interim Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2004). | The development permitted shall be completed in its entirety before the expiration of three months from the date of this permission.  REASON:\tIn order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The siting of the outbuilding along the shared boundary with no. 81 Gonville Crescent, due to its height in conjunction to its excessive depth, results in an unneighbourly form of development that has a detrimental impact on the residential amenity of the occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overdominance  and sense of enclosure and facilitates the overlooking of the neighbouring rear elevations, contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan 2015, policies 1.1 (e) (h), 3.1 (b) and 3.8 of the Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy, policies ELV 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing's Development Management Development Plan (2013) and the advice contained in the interim Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2004). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawings numbered 1046/PL01, received 26/11/2015 and 1046/PL02/B, received 25/01/2016.  REASON: For the avoidance of doubt, in the interest of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of the existing building.  REASON:\tTo ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Development Management, Development Plan Document (2013); adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015); and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, no windows or other openings (other than those shown on the submitted plans) shall be formed in the walls or roof of the development permitted.   Reason: To protect the living conditions of occupants of nearby properties in accordance with policies 7A, 7.4, and 7.B of the Development Management DPD (2013); policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | The development permitted shall only be used for domestic purposes ancillary to the dwelling house at this site and not for any separate residential use or for any industrial, commercial or business use.  Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2015), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | No kitchen facilities shall be installed into the outbuilding hereby approved.   Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2015), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
