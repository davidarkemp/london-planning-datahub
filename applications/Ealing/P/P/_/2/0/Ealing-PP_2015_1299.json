REASON: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Samples of the external materials to be used for the external surfaces of the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any part of the development is commenced, and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application.  Development shall be carried out in accordance with these approved details.

REASON:  To protect the living conditions of occupants of nearby properties, in accordance with policy 7B of the Adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies 1.1 (g), 2.1 (c) and 2.10 of the Adopted Core Strategy (2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan - consolidated (2015). | The design of the building shall comply with the aims and objectives of the Secured By Design standards before the first occupation of the development.   REASON: To ensure that the development incorporates crime prevention measures to help prevent crime and disorder and to improve pedestrian accessibility in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy LV 7.3 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), and policy 7.3 of the London Plan (2015). | The residential dwelling hereby approved shall be constructed to the Lifetime Homes Standards.
