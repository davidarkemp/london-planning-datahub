    "The proposed development, by reason of the poor design, height and significant length of the ground floor extension, as well as its failure to harmonise with the pitched roof of the neighbour's extension and its prominent location, will have a detrimental impact on the street scene of Belsize Avenue contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the Ealing UDP, strategic policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Core Strategy, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011) and the Council's SPD 4 (design). | The proposed development, by reason of the position of the windows and the consequential lack of both privacy and outlook to the principle habitable rooms of the ground floor residential unit, will result in a harmful and inadequate standard of living accommodation for future occupiers, contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2011), policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.6 of the Ealing UDP, strategic policy 1.1 of the Core Strategy and the GLA's SPD on Housing Design."
