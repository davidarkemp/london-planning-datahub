    "The proposed development by virtue of its inappropriate design, scale, mass, and position, would result in an incompatible and incongruous form of development which would be out of keeping with the spatial character and general pattern of development in the area, harming the character and appearance of the street, contrary to policies 4.1, and 5.5, of the Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012); emerging policies 7.4 and 7B of the Development Management Development Plan Document; adopted policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 of the London Plan (July 2011); and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | The design, depth, height and siting, of the proposed development, particularly the rear projection would result in loss of outlook, loss of light, dominance and a detrimental sense of enclosure, therefore having a significant detrimental impact upon the amenity of occupiers of the original dwelling No. 12 Elm Tree Close. As such the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5, of the Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012); emerging policy 7A of the Development Management Development Plan Document; adopted policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011); and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012)."
