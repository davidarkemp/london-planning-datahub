    "The proposed first floor enclosed canopy structure, by reason of its siting, visual prominence, scale and design, would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the property and surrounding area and detract from residential amenities of the neighbouring property at no. 32 Northfield Avenue, resulting in a loss of outlook and an overbearing impact which would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 (e) (g) and (j) and 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Adopted Ealing Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015)."
