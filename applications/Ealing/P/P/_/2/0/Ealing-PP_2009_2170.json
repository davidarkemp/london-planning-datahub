    "The proposed development by reason of its design, scale, layout, density and its proximity to site boundaries would adversely affect the residential amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring dwellings. The proposed development would result in overlooking and loss of outlook to the existing dwellings at numbers 70 and 71 Emerald Square, Southall. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), policies 3A.6 and 4B.1 of the London Plan 'The Spatial Development Strategy for London' 2008 (Consolidated with alterations since 2004). PPS 1 and PPS 3. | The proposed residential development by reason of its design, scale, layout, density and the interrelationship of blocks A and B, would result in the provision of poor levels of outlook and privacy for the future occupiers of proposed units 5, 6, 9 and 10. The development would also provide poor levels of outlook and light to proposed units 1, 2 and 3 due to the provision of lightwells and retaining walls. All of which would be harmful to the living conditions of the future occupiers contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), policies 3A.6 and 4B.1 of the London Plan 'The Spatial Development Strategy for London' 2008 (Consolidated with alterations since 2004), PPS 1 and PPS 3. | The proposal fails to make adequate provision, through planning obligations and financial contributions, to address the impact of the development on local highways and social infrastructure including education services (the demand for which would be increased by this development); the maintenance and enhancement of local children's play facilities (in lieu of providing sufficient on site children's playspace) and the implementation of parking restrictions on Priory Way and waiting restrictions on Western Road (to mitigate for the under-provision of car parking spaces, prevent an increase in car parking congestion and prevent commercial deliveries to the site from Western Road). All contrary to policies 1.10, 3.5, 4.1, 5.5, 9.1, 9.5, 9.6, 9.8, and 9.9 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), Draft Supplementary Planning Document 9 (Planning Obligations) and policies 3C.1, 3D.13, 4B.1 and 6A.5 of the London Plan 'The Spatial Development Strategy for London' 2008 (Consolidated with alterations since 2004), PPS 1 , PPS 3, PPG 13 and PPG 17 and the London Plan Supplementary Planning Guidance on Providing for Children and Young People's Play and Informal Recreation. | Inadequate information has been submitted with this application regarding renewable energy (including floor plans and elevation plans to show the location and appearance of renewable energy generation equipment together with sufficient on site communal amenity space in accordance with UDP Policy 5.5) to allow the Local Planning Authority to assess whether the development would generate 10% of predicted baseline energy demand from on site renewable energy generating equipment. The application would be contrary to policy 2.9 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), policies 4A.1, 4A.3, 4A.4 and 4A.7 of the London Plan 'The Spatial Development Strategy for London' 2008 (Consolidated with alterations since 2004) and PPS 1, PPS 3 and PPS 22."
