  "description": "Extension to the existing commercial space comprising the change of use of the residential unit to the rear (99m2) and infill extension (17m2) to create an addition 116 m2 of retail space including minor re-positioning of the internal stairway to maintain access to the residential flats at first floor level\n \n The consultation period for the applications ref:  PP/2014/4453 and PP/2014/4452 for 18-20 St. Mary's Road, W5 is being extended for a further two weeks from Friday 17th October 2014 to allow anyone interested to have their say.\n The existing premises at 18 St. Marys Road was a restaurant and any change of use from a restaurant to a retail use is permitted development and therefore does not require planning permission.  The proposals also relate to an infill extension and change of use of the residential flat at 20 St. Mary's Road to retail which requires planning permission\n \n Please note that the council has no power to choose one retailer over another\n",
