    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  REASON:\tIn order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title J14-050 P(20)001, J14-050 P(20)002 Rev C, J14-050 P(20)003 Rev C, J14-050 P(20)004 Rev C, J14-050 P(20)010 Rev B,  J14-050 P(20)011 Rev B, J14-050 P(20)012 Rev A, J14-050 P(20)H100 Rev A, J14-050 P(20)B100 Rev C, J14-050 P(20)B101 Rev B, J14-050 P(20)H200 Rev A, J14-050 P(20)B200 Rev C, J14-050 P(20)H300 Rev A, J14-050 P(20)B300 Rev A Design & Access Statement, Design & Access Statement Addendum dated 18 November 2014.  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Details of the materials and finishes to be used for the external surfaces of the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority before any part of the development is commenced and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application. The development shall be implemented only in accordance with these approved details and thereafter retained as such.   Reason: To ensure that the materials and finishes harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 3.5, 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 3.5, 7.4, 7.5 & 7.6 of the London Plan (2011), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012) | Details of hard and soft landscaping including tree planting amd permeable surfaces shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority prior to the occupation of the development. The details as approved shall be laid out and planted within the first planting season following the commencement of the development or such other period as may be agreed in writing with the local planning authority. Any trees or plants which within 5 years of planting, die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced with others of the same size and species and in the same positions within the next planting season. This hard and soft landscaping shall be subject to a landscape management plan, details of which shall be submitted to and approved by local planning authority prior to the first occupation of the development. The landscaping shall thereafter be maintained and managed in accordance with the approved landscape management programme.  Reason: To ensure that the development is landscaped in the interests of the visual character and appearance of the area and to mitigate for the loss of trees which would be removed from the site all in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 3.5, 5.10, 7.4 & 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 3.5, 5.10, 7.4, 7.5 & 7.21 of the London Plan (2011) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | Each residential unit hereby permitted shall be constructed to achieve a minimum Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4 of the Code for Sustainable Homes (based on November 2010 Technical Guidance).  Within 3 months of the construction of the development (unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority), details of an 'Interim Design Stage' assessment and related certification should be submitted, and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Following the completion of the final residential unit, a Code for Sustainable Homes 'Post Construction Stage' assessment and related certification confirming the Code Level that has been achieved, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved measures and technologies to achieve the minimum Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4 standard and to ensure that the development is carbon neutral shall be implemented in accordance with the approval and thereafter shall be maintained in working order.   Reason: In the interest of addressing climate change and to secure sustainable development in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 5.2 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013),  policies  5.1-5.7 of the London Plan (2011), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | Due to current use of the site as garages this gives rise to potential contamination of the site from Petroleum based hydrocarbons, Asbestos, and other contaminants in made ground on the Site. An Intrusive ground Investigation will be required to ascertain the level of possible contamination particularly in the private gardens , communal gardens, soft landscaping areas, and within the proposed buildings footprints of the development. The intrusive ground investigation should be undertaken after the site clearance to ensure the sampling of the soils and land gas monitoring is not restricted due to inaccessible locations. The land gas monitoring should be undertaken in accordance with current best practice guidance CIRIA C665 and BS8576:2013. The Following criteria must be complied with in the land gas investigation: - A minimum of three gas monitoring wells are installed in areas of concerns such as within the building footprints of the proposed residential buildings.  - Separate gas monitoring wells are preferred due to the potential for pathway formations and interference of the soil gas regime by soil gases dissolved in groundwater  - It is recommended in Table 5.5a and Table 5.5b for this type of development site that a minimum of six rounds of monitoring is undertaken over a period of three months.  - During the monitoring visits a minimum capture of two 'significant' falls of atmospheric pressure should be included, which are considered as worst case conditions.  Remediation (Decontamination) measures may be required to provide sufficient mitigation. I would recommend the following conditions are placed on planning approval if minded: a)\tPrior to the commencement of any works on site (except demolition and site clearance) the following shall be submitted to and subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority: i.\tAn intrusive contaminated land investigation and risk assessment of the site shall be carried out in accordance with BS1075:2011+A1:2013 and CR11 guidance to assess the nature and extent of any contamination on the site.

It shall include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site management procedures.  The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation. b)\tFollowing completion of measures identified in the approved contamination remediation scheme, a verification report that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out shall be produced and submitted to and subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority. The verification report submitted shall be in accordance with the Environment Agency guidance 'Verification of Remediation of Land Contamination', Report: SC030114/R1'.  Reason: To protect the health and living conditions of residents in the area and the future residents of the site in accordance policy 1.1 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 5.13 of The London Plan, the National Planning Policy Framework (2012),  DEFRA and the Environment Agency's 'Model Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination, CLR 11', and the Environment Agency guidance 'Verification of Remediation of Land Contamination', Report: SC030114/R1'. | Prior commencent of development, details of the positions, design, materials and type of boundary treatment to be erected shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority and provided prior to the first occupation of the development.
