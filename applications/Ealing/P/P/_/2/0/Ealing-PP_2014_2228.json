Reason: To ensure that the surrounding streets are not subject to parking stress or danger or nuisance from inappropriate on-street parking or waiting as a result of the proposed development in accordance with policies 1.1, & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy LV 6.13 of the Ealing Draft Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), and policies 6.3, & 6.13 of The London Plan (2011), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
