    "The proposed variation of condition (2), by reason of the design, materials proposed and removal of vegetation, would result in a unsympathetic form of development which would erode the character of the Locally Listed Building. Furthermore, the erosion of the character of a prominent Locally listed Building within the Hanwell Village Conservation Area would adversely impact the character of the Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2012); Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2015); Policies LV 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development DPD 2013 and the Hanwell Village Conservation Area Management Plan 2008."
