    "The residential development as existing by reason of its excessive scale, height, appearance and failure to provide adequate amenity space and refuse storage to serve the development is constituting an obtrusive overdevelopment of the site, out of character with the form and pattern of development in the area and detrimental to the appearance of the street scene and detrimental to the living conditions of neighbouring residents by reason of an increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the Council's Adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Policies 3.5, 3.8, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2011 and adopted Supplementary Planning Documents and Guidance. | The development, by reason of its size and scale, failure to provide adequate amenity space/refuse storage to serve the development and relative position to adjoining properties is representative of a cramped form of overdevelopment, out of proportion with the original property and to constitute an incongruous form of 'infill' development, resulting in a substandard form of living accommodation. As such, the development is contrary to Policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the Adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan and advice contained in Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (London Plan 2011)."
