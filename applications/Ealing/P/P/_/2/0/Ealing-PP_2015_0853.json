    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plan: 14/50/HRA/307D, 14/50/HRA/308C, 14/50/HRA/310B and 14/50/HRA/311B.  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the existing materials and those as described on the plans.  Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies LV 7.4 and 7B, policies 1.1 (h), 1.2 (g) and 3.8 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan Consolidated (2015). | Notwithstanding any information submitted with this application, the residential unit hereby approved shall be constructed to achieve to a minimum Level 4 of the Code for Sustainable Homes (in respect of access, internal floor space, water efficiency and energy). The associated reports/ assessment and certifications to demonstrate compliance shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval as follows:  \"\tAfter commencement of development. Within 3 months of the commencement of the development, evidence that the development is registered with the Building Research Establishment (BRE) under the Code for Sustainable Homes latest technical guidance and CfSH Interim Design Stage Assessment and Certificate verified by the BRE will be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval.  \"\tAfter completion of Development  Within 3 months from the date of first occupation of the development, CfSH Post-Construction Stage Assessment and Certificate verified by the BRE will be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval confirming that the agreed sustainability measures have been implemented.   Following any approval of a 'Post Construction Stage' assessment and certificate of the development, the approved measures and technologies to achieve the CfSH Level 4 shall be retained in working order in perpetuity.     Reason: To ensure a sustainable living environment is secured in accordance with policy 5.2G of Ealing Development Management DPD (10th December 2013), Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2026 (3rd April 2012) and policies 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.9 of the London Plan Consolidated 2015, CfS November 2010 Technical Guide/ Addendum 2014 for England Technical Guide. | Before any part of the development hereby permitted is first occupied, arrangements shall have been made to secure a car-free development in accordance with a detailed scheme or agreement which has been approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved scheme or agreement must ensure that:  a) all occupiers of the approved flat cannot apply for, obtain or hold an on-street parking permit to park a vehicle on the public highway within the administrative district of the local planning authority (other than a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 or similar legislation); b) all occupiers of the flat are required to surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held; and c) such a scheme or agreement shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be retained and operated for so long as the use hereby permitted continues.  Reason: To ensure that the development is car-free and does not exacerbate on-street parking pressure in the local controlled parking zone in accordance with policy 6.13 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document, policies 1.1 (f) (g) of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 6.3 and 6.13 of the London Plan - Consolidated (2015). | No part of the roof of the two storey extension shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of neighbouring properties and the visual appearance of the area, in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies LV 7.4 and 7B, policies 1.1 (h) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan Consolidated (2015)."
