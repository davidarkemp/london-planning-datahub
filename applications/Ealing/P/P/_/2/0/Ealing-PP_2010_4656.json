    "The proposed development, by reason of the footprint of the proposed development, the scale, bulk, and height of the buildings and by reason of the proposed removal of an excessive number of protected mature trees and loss of open space, would detrimentally harm the character of the Northolt Village Green Conservation Area. The development would fail to preserve or enhance the character of the conservation area. As such, the development is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), the advice contained within the Council's adopted Northolt Village Green Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan, London Plan Policy 4B.12 and the advice contained within Planning Policy Statement 5: 'Planning for the Historic Environment'. | The development, by reason of the layout, scale, bulk and height of the proposed building on plots 2 & 3, would detrimentally affect the residential amenity of the occupants of the dwellinghouse at 1 Eastcote Lane, Northolt, by reason of excessive enclosure of the rear elevation and garden of that property which contains windows to habitable rooms. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | This application has been submitted with insufficient information in relation to protected mature trees which are indicated for retention as a part of this development including a development specific tree survey, impact assessment and method statement to British Standard 5837:2005 including details of the impact of the development on retained trees and details of underground services together with details of replacement tree planting. The trees on this site make a significant visual contribution to the Northolt Village Green Conservation Area. The proposed development may result in damage to the trees as a result of the buildings, foundations and the construction process. The loss of these trees would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the conservation area and the scheme has therefore failed to take adequate account of existing landscape features that are important elements in the character and appearance of the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.8, 4.1, 4.5 and 4.8, of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), the advice contained within the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance note 9: 'Trees and Development Guidelines', within the adopted Northolt Village Green Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan, London Plan Policies 3D.15 and 4B.12 and Planning Policy Statement 5."
