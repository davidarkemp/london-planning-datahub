    "The proposed conversion of the dwellinghouse into two self contained flats, by reason of their insufficient internal space and failure to provide an adequate private garden space, represent cramped, substandard living conditions for existing and future occupiers and an overdevelopment of the original property.  The development is therefore contrary to policies 5.5 and 5.6 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance SPG13 'Garden Space' and SPG14 'Internal Living Space for New Dwellings and Conversions' and policies 3.3 and 3.5 of the London Plan (2011). | The proposed rear roof extension by reason of its size, scale, width, depth and design would result in a dominant and incongorous addition to the dwellinghouse and is therefore considered to be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the application site and  surrounding area in general. As such, the development is contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011)."
