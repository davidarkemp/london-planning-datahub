REASON:\tIn order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title number(s)  14/935/101, 14/935/110, 14/935/111, 14/935/112 Rev B, 14/935/113, 14/935/120, 14/935/121, 14/935/122, 14/935/123,14/935/130, 14/935/131 and 14/935/132.  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials (including materials to be used within the rear roof extension) to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.  REASON:\tTo ensure that the materials harmonise with the existing building and surrounding area, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | The proposed first floor level terrace to flat 6 and the proposed raised platform to flat 3 shall provide for a 1.8m high obscure glazed screen along their eastern sides as indicated on drawings 14/935/111 and 14/935/112 Rev B. The screens so approved shall be retained permanently.  REASON: To protect the living conditions of neighbouring properties and the visual appearance of the area, in accordance with policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | Refuse storage shall be provided in accordance with the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority.

The approved scheme or agreement must ensure that:  a) all occupiers of the additional residential units created cannot apply for, obtain or hold an on-street parking permit to park a vehicle on the public highway within the administrative district of the local planning authority (other than a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 or similar legislation); b) all occupiers of the additional residential units created are required to surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held; and c) such a scheme or agreement shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be retained and operated for so long as the use hereby permitted continues.  Reason: To ensure that the development is car-free and does not exacerbate on-street parking pressure in the local controlled parking zone in accordance with policy 6.13 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 6.13 of the London Plan 2011. | A minimum of nine (9) cycle parking spaces shall be provided on site in accordance with adopted standards of the London Plan 2011.

The details should also include the provision of alternative means of ventilation in each room in accordance with Authority's criteria.  The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.
