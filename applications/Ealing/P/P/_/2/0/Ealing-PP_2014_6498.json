    "The single-storey rear outbuilding arranged as a two-bedroom self-contained residential unit by virtue of its plausible self-containment and lack of ancillary or incidental functions to the main property, would be considered inappropriate accommodation providing poor living standards for future occupants and result in acceptable disturbance to the amenity values of the main dwelling and No. 120 West End Road. As such, the development is contrary to policies 7A, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 3.5, 7.4, 7.15 of The London Plan (2011), the London Plan Supplementary Planning Guidance and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
