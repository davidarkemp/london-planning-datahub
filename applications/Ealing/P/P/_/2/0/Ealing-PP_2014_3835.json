As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.6 and 7.8 of The London Plan (2011) and polices 7.4 and 7C of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013) and Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area Management Plan | The rear dormer extension, by reason of its excessive height and width, would constitute an incongruous and prominent feature, out of keeping with the established pattern of development within the Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area and as such would fail to perserve its apperance. This would be contrary to policies 7.6 and 7.8 of The London Plan (2011) and polices 7.4 and 7C of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013) and Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area Management Plan."
