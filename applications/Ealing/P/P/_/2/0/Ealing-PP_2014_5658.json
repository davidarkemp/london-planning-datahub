The approved scheme or agreement must ensure that:  a) all occupiers of the additonal residential units on site cannot apply for, obtain or hold an on-street parking permit to park a vehicle on the public highway within the administrative district of the local planning authority (other than a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 or similar legislation); b) all occupiers of the additional residential units are required to surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held; and c) such a scheme or agreement shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be retained and operated for so long as the use hereby permitted continues.

Reason:\tTo provide adequate facilities for cyclists, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Core Strategy and policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2011. | The car parking spaces shown on the approved plans shall be laid out prior to first occupation of any of the units hereby permitted and permanently retained without obstruction.  Reason: To ensure that there is adequate provision for car parking within the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy and policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2011). | Prior to the commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval for the insulation of the building envelope, with windows shut and other means of ventilation provided, which will achieve the internal criteria for sensitive rooms, as specified in Supplementary Planning Guidance 10.  The details should also include the provision of alternative means of ventilation in accordance with Authority's criteria.

The Construction Logistics Plan shall be implemented on commencement of any works on site and the site shall be managed in accordance with the approved plan for the duration of demolition and construction.   Reason: In the interests of the amenity of adjoining occupiers and to minimise highway and traffic impact during the course of the works, in accordance with policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), policy 1.1 (j) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 5.14 and 5.15 of the London Plan 2011."
