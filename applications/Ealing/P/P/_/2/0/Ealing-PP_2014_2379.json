    "1.\tThe proposed three storey rear extensions, by reason of its overall design, depth and scale, would result in a dominant and obtrusive form of development which would be out of keeping with the character of the property and Acton Town Centre Conservation Area as a whole. As such, the proposal is contrary policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 and 1.2(f) and (g) of the Adopted Ealing Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011). | 2.\tThe proposed three storey rear extension by reason of its design and scale would detract from the residential amenities of neighbouring properties, resulting in loss of light, outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposal is contrary policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 and 1.2(f) and (g) of the Adopted Ealing Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011). | 3.\tThe proposed flats, by reason of their insufficient internal space, represent cramped, substandard living conditions for future occupiers.  The development is therefore contrary to policies 3.4, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), policies 1.1 (h) and 1.2 (f) of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011)."
