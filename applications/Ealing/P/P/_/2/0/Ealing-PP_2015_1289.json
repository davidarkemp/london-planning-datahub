The non-material amendments are to omit the external rain water downpipes (RWP) from the 6th Form and ADT building (except the RWP to the entrance canopy), to alter the font of the cut lettering signage to canopies on the 6th Form and ADT building and the ARK building and to alter the wording of the cut lettering signage to the canopy on the 6th Form and ADT building to read 'St Benedict's Sixth Form', instead of the previously approved \"St Benedict's\".",
