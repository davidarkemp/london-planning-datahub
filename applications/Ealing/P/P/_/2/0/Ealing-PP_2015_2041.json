    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  REASON:\tIn order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: PP_08_15_00_013, PP_08_15_00_014, PP_08_15_00_015, PP_08_15_00_016.  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the existing materials and those as described on the plans.  Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies LV 7.4, 7B and 7C, policies 1.1 (g), 1.2 (f) and 4.1 (d) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan Consolidated (2015). | No part of the roof of the single storey rear extension shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of neighbouring properties and the visual appearance of the area, in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies LV 7.4 and 7B, policies 1.1 (h) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan Consolidated (2015). | Provision for cycle storage in accordance with adopted standards shall be provided and be continuously available and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.  Reason: In the interests of the adequate bicycle storage provision and in the interests of reducing congestion to the local transport network, in accordance with policies 1.1 (j) and 3.1(i) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 6.3, 6.9, 6.11 and 6.13 of the London Plan (2015), the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | Provision for refuse storage in accordance with adopted standards shall be provided and be continuously available and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.  Reason: In the interests of the adequate disposal, storage and collection of waste and recycling, to protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of highway and pedestrian safety, all in accordance with policies 1.1 (e)(f) and 6.1 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A  of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy 5.16 of the London Plan (2015) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | Before any part of the development hereby approved is first occupied, arrangements shall have been made to secure a car-free development for four of the flats, in accordance with a detailed scheme or agreement which has been approved in writing by the local planning authority.
