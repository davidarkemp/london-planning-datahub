    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by virtue of its scale and lack of setbacks from neighbouring properties 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 Wells House Road, would result in an unsubordinate and overly dominant addition to the building. This is considered to result in increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook and light that would be of an unacceptable level. As such, it is considered that the proposal would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework, Policies 7.4, and 7.6 of the London Plan (consolidated 2015), policies 1.1 (g)(h), 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Ealing Development (core) Strategy, policies 7.4 and  7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and the advice contained in the Interim Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2004). It is therefore considered that planning permission should be refused."
