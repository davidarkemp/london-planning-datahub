    "The proposal would result in a cramped over development of the site with poor accessibily to the upper floor level units, inadequate access to daylight and outlook for flats 3, 6, 8 and 9, excessive noise exposure to bedrooms within flats 1, 2, 4, and 5, and the development fails to meet the minimum internal and external living space requirements, resulting in substandard living conditions for future occupiers. As such the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.6 of the Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (Adopted 2004/DCLG Direction 2007); emerging policies 3.5 and 7D of the Development Management, Development Plan Document (2012); adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012); SPG 13 'Garden Space'; adopted policies 3.5, 3.8, and 3.9 of the London Plan (2011); and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | The proposed fourth floor front section of the development by virtue of its inappropriate design, scale, bulk, mass, and position, would result in an incompatible and incongruous form of development to an otherwise homogenous group of buildings with fatade value and incidental features, detrimentally harming the character and appearance of the street, contrary to policies 4.1, 4.7 and 5.5, of the Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012); emerging policies 7.4 and 7B of the Development Management Development Plan Document; adopted policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 of the London Plan (July 2011); and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | Inadequate information has been submitted regarding noise mitigation (including details of noise insulation for the building, and external plant and machinery) to allow the Local Planning Authority to establish whether the development would impact on the amenity of nearby residents and provide good living conditions for future residents. such, the proposal is contrary to adopted policies 4.1 and 4.11 of the Adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004);  Supplementary Planning Guidance 10; adopted Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (Draft 2013); adopted policies 3.5 and 7.14 of the London Plan (2011); and the National Planning Policy Framework (2012). | The proposal fails to make adequate provision, through planning obligations and contributions, to: address the impact of the development on social infrastructure such as open space and recreational facilities; secure a range of transport initiatives to ensure the development would qualify as a low car housing and city car club schemes contrary to adopted policy 1.10 of the Ealing Unitary Development Plan (\"Plan for the Environment\"); to Supplementary Planning Document 9; to adopted policy 6.4 of the Development (or Core) Strategy; to adopted policy 8.2 of the London Plan (2011); and National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
