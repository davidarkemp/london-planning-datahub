    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its siting, size, design and poor integration with the subject property, would be out of character with the general style and pattern of development in the area, would be harmful to the appearance of the original dwellinghouse and to the pair of semi-detached dwellings of which it forms a part, and would fail to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and to the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2006) and in the Council's adopted Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area Guidelines."
