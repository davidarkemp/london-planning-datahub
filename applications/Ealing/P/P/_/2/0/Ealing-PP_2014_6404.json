    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  REASON:\tIn order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title number(s) 422-A-001 Revision A, 422-A-002 Revision B and 422-A-003 Revision A.   Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.  REASON:\tTo ensure that the materials harmonise with the existing building and surrounding area, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | The ground floor side facing windows shall contain only obscure glass (minimum level 3 obscure glazed) and non-opening unless the parts of the window can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the rooms in which the windows are installed. The windows so approved shall be retained permanently.  REASON: To protect the living conditions of neighbouring properties and the future occupiers of the ground floor flat, in accordance with policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2011). | Before any part of the development hereby permitted is first occupied arrangements shall have been made to secure a car-free development in accordance with a detailed scheme or agreement which has been approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved scheme or agreement must ensure that:  a) all occupiers of the approved studio flat at second floor level cannot apply for, obtain or hold an on-street parking permit to park a vehicle on the public highway within the administrative district of the local planning authority (other than a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 or similar legislation); b) all occupiers of the second floor level studio flat are required to surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held; and c) such a scheme or agreement shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be retained and operated for so long as the use hereby permitted continues.  Reason: To ensure that the development is car-free and does not exacerbate on-street parking pressure in the local controlled parking zone in accordance with policy 6.13 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 6.13 of the London Plan 2011. | A minimum of two (2) cycle parking spaces shall be provided on site for the ground floor level flat and a minimum of two (2) cycle parking spaces shall be provided for the first and second floor level flats in accordance with adopted standards of the London Plan 2011. Such provision shall be brought into use prior to first occupation and retained permanently.  Reason:\tTo provide adequate facilities for cyclists, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Core Strategy and policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2011."
