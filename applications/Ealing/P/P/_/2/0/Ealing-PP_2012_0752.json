    "The proposed conservatory extension, combined with the existing single storey rear extension, due to its excessive depth and incongruous design, would adversely affect the residential amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property no 4 Costons Avenue by way of its obtrusive design and an increased sense of enclosure and would adversely impact on the character and appearance of the parent dwelling and the area in general. It is thus contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Document 4 ' Residential Extensions' and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of The London Plan 'Spatial Development Strategy for Greater London' (July 2011)."
