    "The proposed two-storey side and single storey rear extensions, by reason of their considerable dimensions and scale, would represent an undesirable overdevelopment of the site that would materially harm the character and appearance of the original dwelling and its surroundings, and would not respect or reflect the scale of the original property or the prevailing pattern of development in the area as a whole. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7B, 7.4 and 7D of the adopted Ealing Development Plan Document 2013 and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document 4: ' Residential Extensions' (2006)\". | The proposed two-storey side and single storey rear extensions, as a result of their size, bulk, scale, design (in the context of the original building), proximity to boundaries and relationship with neighbouring properties, would constitute an obtrusive form of development that would have a negative impact on the streetscape and detract from the established character and appearance of the property. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7B, 7.4 and 7D of the adopted Ealing Development Plan Document 2013 and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document 4: ' Residential Extensions' (2006\"). | The proposed use as a self-contained residential unit, by virtue of the small and cramped living conditions resulting from the proposal, would afford poor and substandard living accommodation contrary to policies 3.5 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Plan Document 2013 and policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2011."
