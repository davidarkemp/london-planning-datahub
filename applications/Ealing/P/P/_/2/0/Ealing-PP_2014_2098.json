    "Given the vicinity of the proposed parking area to the first floor residential units on site, and the residential properties to the rear it is considered that the proposal would give rise to an undesirable outlook from upper floor accommodation, noise and disturbance to the detriment of the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring residential properties. This use is therefore contrary to policies 7A and 7B of Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The intensive use of the site for vehicle parking and consequent use of Empire Road for manoeuvring cars into and out of the site and the inadequate pedestrian sightlines for vehicles exiting the site results in conditions detrimental to the general amenity of the locality, the safety of pedestrians and road users and the free flow of traffic on the neighbouring highways."
