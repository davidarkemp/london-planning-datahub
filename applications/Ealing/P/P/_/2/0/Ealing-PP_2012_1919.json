    "The development, which involves the subdivision of a dwellinghouse that is below the size considered suitable for conversion to flats, would result in the loss of a small dwellinghouse for which there is a continued demand within the borough. The proposal would represent an undesirable overdevelopment of the site, as it would result in substandard living accommodation for residents of the flats, due to the small unit sizes and poor internal layout and inadequate amenity space provision, which would be harmful to the living conditions of future occupants of the site. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.3, 4.11, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) Ealing Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), and Supplementary Planning Guidance notes (SPG) 10: 'Noise and Vibration', 13: 'Garden Space' and 14: 'Indoor Living Space for New Dwellings and Conversions' as well as policies 1.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 6.13, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.6,7.15 of the London Plan (2011)."
