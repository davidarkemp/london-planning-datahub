    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that there is no longer a need for the existing community facility in that location, contrary to policy 8.1 of the Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), London Plan (July 2011) policy 3.17, and the National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | The design, depth, height and siting, of the proposed building would allow for an increased sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, loss of light, and would be over dominant, therefore having a significant detrimental impact upon the amenity of occupiers at No. 298 Church Road. As such the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, and 5.5, of the Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); to Supplementary Planning Guidance 13 'Garden Space'; adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012); London Plan (July 2011) policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6; and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | The design, scale and proximity to the boundary of the proposed first floor level and second floor level balconies/roof terraces would give rise to noise disturbance, result in loss of privacy, and increased overlooking of habitable room windows and the private rear gardens of neighbouring properties. The proposal is thus contrary contrary to policies 4.1, and 5.5, of the Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012); London Plan (July 2011) policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6; and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | The proposed building by virtue of its design, bulk, height and dense form within a cramped site when compared to adjacent dwellings would adversely impact the character and appearance of the street, contrary to policies 4.1, and 5.5, of the Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012); London Plan (July 2011) policies 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6; and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | The development provides a shortfall in off street parking spaces and the layout of the spaces provided will lead to vehicles reversing to / from a busy classified road, to the detriment of the safe and free flow of traffic, and highway safety; exacerbating parking stress on surrounding roads,  contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5, 5.9, 9.1, and 9.9 of the Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004); adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012); Supplementary Planning Document 8; London Plan (July 2011) policies 6.3 and 6.12; and National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012). | The development results in a cramped over development of the site, which fails to provide sufficient internal living space and outdoor amenity space, and the orientation/layout of the units result in habitable spaces having limited access to outlook and daylight, resulting in substandard living conditions for future occupiers. As such the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, and 5.5 of the Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (Adopted 2004/DCLG Direction 2007); London Plan (July 2011) policies 3.5, and 7.6; and the National Planning Policy Framwork (March 2012)."
