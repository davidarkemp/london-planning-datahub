No variation of the approved monitoring program shall take place without the prior written agreement of the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: Details of the programme of monitoring the tree works is required prior to the commencement of any site preparation works because such works would carry a high risk of damaging trees and other vegetation particularly by site operatives that are not experienced to carry out works around trees. The protection of trees and other vegetation is required in accordance with policies 7.19 and 7.21 of the London Plan (2015), and interim SPG 9 'Trees and Development Guidelines'. | Sound insulation and noise control measures for the approved residential dwellings shall be installed to achieve the internal noise targets described at Section 4(B) 'Criteria for adequate protection for new buildings' of Ealing's interim SPG 10:  Bedrooms (23:00-0700 hrs) 30 dB LAeq, and 45 dB Lmax (fast) Living rooms (0700-2300 hrs) 35dB LAeq Kitchens, bathrooms, WC and utility rooms (0700-2300 hrs) 45 dB LAeq  The sound insulation and noise control measures shall be installed prior to the first use and / or first occupation of the relevant part of the development and maintained thereafter.
