    "The proposed development is considered to fall within Schedule 2, 10(b) of the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2011 (SI 1824), being an urban development project.  The proposed development has been Screened having regard to the selection criteria set out in Schedule 3 of the Regulations, namely having regard to:    (i) the characteristics of development;   (ii) the location of development, and  (iii) the characteristics of the potential impact.    The Local Planning Authority is of the opinion that the proposed development will not be likely to have significant effects on the environment as interpreted by the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2011; and thereby does not constitute EIA development requiring an Environmental Statement. This is not to say that the proposed development will not have environmental effects of a localised nature which will need to be considered in determining any planning application(s)."
