    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The external materials to be used in the development hereby approved shall accord with the details indicated on drawing ref: 005 Rev C and the Design & Access Statement (received 13.03.2008); unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To ensure that the development is constructed in accordance with the details submitted with the application, in accordance with policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004. | Refuse and recycling storage areas indicated on drawing ref: 002 Rev A (received 13.03.2008) shall be provided and brought into use prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained permanently thereafter unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason:  To protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of the visual amenity and character of the area in accordance with policies 2.10 and 4.1 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Guidance Note 4: Refuse and Recycling. | Secure parking/storage for five bicycles shall be provided within the site and brought into use prior to first occupation, and retained permanently unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To provide adequate facilities for cyclists in accordance with policy 9.6 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004. | Details of measures for protecting the building envelope (roof, walls and windows) of the residential units from external noise, vibration, including aircraft noise, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any part of the development is commenced.  The works shall be carried out as approved before first occupation and shall thereafter be retained unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of future occupiers of the residential units, in accordance with policies 4.1, 4.11 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Guidance 10 'Noise and Vibration'. | All residential units hereby approved shall be constructed to Lifetime Homes Standards, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.   Reason: To ensure access for all future occupiers in accordance with policy 5.3 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Guidance 7 'Accessible Ealing'. | The design of the building shall comply with the aims and objectives of the Secured By Design award before the first occupation of the development, and shall be permanently retained unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To ensure that the proposed development achieves the required crime prevention elements as detailed by Government Circular 5/94 'Planning Out Crime', with the requirements of Clause 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which imposes a duty on a Local Authority 'to do all that it can to prevent crime and disorder in its area', and with policy 4.4 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and adopted SPG 8: 'Safer Ealing'. | Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, no windows or other openings (other than those shown on the submitted plans) shall be formed in the walls or roof of the building permitted.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of neighbouring properties and the visual appearance of the area, in accordance with policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004. | Prior to the first occupation of the residential development hereby permitted, details of a scheme to provide fresh air ventilation to habitable rooms, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and thereafter retained permanently, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To ensure that the residential units that have their only openings within the High Street frontage would have fresh air ventilation, in accordance with policies 2.6, 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004. | Prior to the commencement of the development hereby permitted, arrangements shall be agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority and put in place to ensure that the future occupiers or their visitors shall not obtain a residents' parking permit within the adopted Controlled Parking Zone.  Reason: To ensure that the occupation of the additional residential units does not contribute to further competition for on-street parking in the Controlled Parking Zone to the detriment of highway safety and convenience, and to ensure that the restriction on the future occupiers of the site is dealt with approriately through the completion of a s.106 Legal Agreement; in accordance with policies 1.10, 4.1, 9.1 and 9.8 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Document 3: Low Car Housing in Controlled Parking Zones."
