    "The replacement garage to the side of the dwellinghouse, by reason of its size, scale, design, inappropriate front projecting bay and loss of the original garage feature, would fail to respect the original character of the dwellinghouse and would introduce an incongruous feature, out of keeping with the street scene and the general pattern of development in the area.  This element of the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area.  As such, the proposed development is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Design Guide. | The proposed ground floor side and rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, height, depth, bulk and inappropriate detailing and fenestration, would fail to appear sufficiently subordinate to, or integrate well with the existing building, would be harmful to its original character and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area.  As such, the proposed development is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Design Guide. | The proposed rear dormer roof extensions, by reason of their design, siting and unsymmetrical appearance, would sit awkwardly within the existing rear roof slope and would be out of keeping with the character of the original dwellinghouse and the general pattern of development in the area and would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Design Guide. | The proposed front garden layout, by reason of insufficient provision of soft landscaping, would result in a large area of hardstanding surface that would be detrimental to the overall appearance of the site itself and the local street scene and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation.  As such, the proposed layout is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Design Guide. | The proposed rooflights to the front and side roof slopes (including those within the roof of the proposed single storey side extension), by reason of their size, position and visibility from the street, would have a harmful impact on the visual amenity of the original dwellinghouse and the local street scene and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Design Guide."
