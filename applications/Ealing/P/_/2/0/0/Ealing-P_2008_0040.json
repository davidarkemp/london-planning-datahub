    "The proposed two-storey extension at the side of the existing house and in line with the main front wall and the flank boundary will build up the entire site frontage and will tend to produce the appearance of a terrace particularly if repeated on adjacent properties.  Such development would be out of keeping with existing properties in the vicinity and harmful to the visual character of the area, contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Doucment 4: Residential Extensions. | The proposed front extension, by reason of its projection forward of the existing front elevation and width would be harmful to the street scene and to the visual character of the area, contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Doucment 4: Residential Extensions. | The proposed rear extension, by reason of its height and proximity to boundaries would have a harmful effect on the living conditions currently enjoyed by the residents and occupiers of adjoining properties, resulting in a overbearing and enclosing impact, contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Doucment 4: Residential Extensions."
