    "The proposal represents an overdevelopment & overintensification of the use of the site with excessive plot ratio having little scope for landscaping and unsatisfactory provision of vehicular access which would result in perpetuation of unsatisfactory environment and situation to the detriment of highway safety and amenities of the locality contrary to policies 4.1, 4.5, 5.1, 5.5, 9.1, 9.9 and Supplementary Guidance 6 concerning Plot Ratios of the adopted UDP (Plan for the Environment 2004) | The proposed extension, by reason of its scale, size and siting would be harmful to the character of nearby land designated as Green Corridor and residential properties beacuse of overbearing appearance, overdominance and visual intrusion contrary to policies 3.2, 4.1, 4.5 and 5.5 of the adopted UDP (Plan for the Environment - 2004). | The proposed extension due to its size scale and siting would have a harmful effect on the amenities of adjoining occupiers on south side due to overpowering and enclosing effect, overbearing appearance and mutual loss of privacy contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted UDP (Plan for the Environment -2004). | The proposal failed to demonstrate that the development could be adequately sound proofed against external noise and vibration and therefore, the proposed residential units lacking associated amenity space and adjoining a busy railway line / depot would not provide normal standards of amenities to future occupiers of the site contrary to policies 4.1, 4.3, 4.11, 5.5 and Supplementary Guidance concerning Garden Space."
