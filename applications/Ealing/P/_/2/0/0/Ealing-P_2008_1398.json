    "The proposed introduction of rooflights and erection of an external staircase, by reason of their siting and nature, would be significantly out of keeping with the design and appearance of the original property and would fail to perserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Mount Park Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The proposed internal stacking showing the second floor living room positioned above the first floor bedroom and second floor bedroom above the first floor living room would be likely to create a level of noise and disturbance detrimental to the residential amenities of the future occupants to the flats. as such, the proposal is contrary to policy 4.11 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidence note 10: 'Noise and Vibration'. | The resiting of the access to the upper floor units to the side elevation would not allow for adequate natural surveillance of the entrance to these flats. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 4.4 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance note 8: 'Safer Ealing'."
