Reason: To provide adaptable and accessible living accommodation for people with impaired mobility, in accordance with policies 4.1, 4.3, 5.3 and 5.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Guidance 7: Accessible Ealing. | The proposed parking and access arrangements shown on drawing Nos: 200C and 205C received 29/10/2007 (including disabled parking provision), shall be implemented prior to first occupation of any part of the development, together with the reinstatement of the kerb/pavement where appropriate, to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. A splay of 1.5m x 1.5m shall be provided on either side of the access, the depth measured from the back of the footway and the widths outwards from the edges of the access, and no fence, wall or other obstruction to visibility exceeding 0.6m in height above the surface of the adjoining highway shall be erected within the areas of such splays. The parking spaces shall be kept continuously available for car parking and shall not be used for any other purpose, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To ensure that there is adequate access and provision for car parking at the site and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with policies 5.5, 9.1 and 9.9 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The design of the development shall comply with the aims and objectives of Secured By Design and such measures shall be brought into place prior to the occupation of the development hereby approved and thereafter retained, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

This will bring the dwellings within Category B noise exposure, requiring noise mitigation measures as follows:The insulation of the building envelope, with windows shut and other means of ventilation provided, shall achieve the internal criteria for sensitive rooms, as specified at Document 5.3 \"Guidance for developers\", using the specified worst mode one hour LAeq,1hr spectrum noise level. Such measures shall be implemented before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.
