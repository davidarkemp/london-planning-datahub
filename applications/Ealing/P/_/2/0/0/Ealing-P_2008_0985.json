    "Inadequate information has been submitted with the application (including whether the use would provide short or long stay tourist and business accommodation or meet a special housing need, the length of stay of guests and marketing information which would indicate demand for the proposal) to allow the Local Planning Authority to assess whether the change of use of the dwellinghouse to bed and breakfast accomodation would be acceptable in principle. In light of this the application has failed to justify the loss of a 3-bedroomed single family dwelling for which there is a strong demand within the borough. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 6.7 (Hotel Development) of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The proposed development, by reason of its siting, layout, position of ground and first floor bedroom windows and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring property at 1 Orchard Avenue. The proposed development would appear overdominant and overbearing and would result in overlooking of the rear garden and a material loss of privacy. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 4.1 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The proposed extension, by reason of its design, scale, bulk and massing, would constitute an unharmonious and prominent addition that would be out of keeping with and detrimental to the character of the area and the streetscene. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 4.1 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The development fails to provide details of refuse and recycling storage facilities, contrary to policies 2.10 and 4.1 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance note 4: 'Refuse and Recycling Facilities'. | The proposed development would fail to provide an inclusive and accessible development, compliant with the relevant accessibility standards. As such, the development is contrary to policies 4.1 and 4.3  of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance note 7: 'Accessible Ealing'. | Inadequate information has been submitted regarding existing trees on the site, one of which (the Conifer located between 21 Herbert Road & 1 Orchard Avenue) makes a significant contribution to the visual amenity of the area. The proposed development may result in direct and indirect damage to this tree as a result of the positioning of the built development and the operation of the equipment required during the construction process. The loss of the tree in question would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the area and it is therefore considered that the scheme has therefore failed to take adequate account of existing landscape features that are important elements in the character and appearance of the site. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.8, 4.1, 4.5 and 4.8 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance note 9: 'Trees and Development Guidelines'."
