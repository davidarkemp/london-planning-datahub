    "The proposed development, due to its size, massing, and siting in relation to no. 62 and 64 Twyford Avenue would represent an overbearing and visually intrusive form of infill development, out of character with the pattern of development in the conservation area and harmful to the living conditions of the adjoining occupiers by reason of enclosure and loss of outlook to both properties and overshadowing to the rear garden of no. 64. As such the proposal would be contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004)."
