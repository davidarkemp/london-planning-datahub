    "1. The consent shall expire after a period of 5 years from the date of this notice.  2. Any advertisements displayed, and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a clean and tidy condition to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.  3. Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a safe condition.  4. Where an advertisement is required under these Regulations to be removed, the removal shall be carried out to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.  5. No advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.  6. No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of, any road traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or so as otherwise to render hazardous the use of any highway, waterway (including any coastal waters) or aerodrome (civil or military). | The proposed illuminated projecting sign, by reason of its size and siting, would be unduly obtrusive in the streetscene and thus would have a harmful effect on the appearance and character of the area, which is a designated Conservation Area, contrary to Adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) Policies B13, B24 and ES8 and Replacement UDP Policies 4.8 and 4.10."
