    "The proposed new dwellinghouse, by reason of its prominent location and its excessive width would constitute an intrusive and dominant form of development, which would be out of keeping with the character of the area and be detrimental to the visual amenity of the immediate locality. As such, the development is contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.6 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The proposal, by reason of its excessive provision of parking spaces and the location of the proposed crossovers immediately adjacent to a junction, would prejudice the safety of the existing highway users, including motorists, cyclists, pedestrians, children and people with disabilities. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 9.1 and 9.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004)."
