    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of five years from the date of this permission.  Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | Works for the demolition of these buildings or any part thereof shall not be commenced before a valid construction contract under which one of the parties is obliged to carry out and itself complete the works of redevelopment of the site for which planning permission was granted simultaneously with this consent has been entered into and evidence of such construction contract has first been submitted to and formally accepted in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To prevent premature demolition and the creation of a cleared site which would be harmful to the visual amenity of the area and adversely affect its character, in accordance with policy 4.8 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004)."
