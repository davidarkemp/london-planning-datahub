    "The design and location of the external staircase would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of the ground floor flat at the subject site and 74 Rothschild Road, in terms of loss of privacy, and increased overlooking; and by reason of its depth, the proposal would adversely affect the amenities of No. 2 Temple Road, in terms of visual intrusion and loss of light and would adversely affect the amenities of the surrounding properties in terms of loss of light, visual intrusion and an increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the Council's adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2006). | The proposal by reason of its design, location and in particular the proximity of the straircase to the the window of the ground floor flats rear window and No. 76s rear ground floor windows, would be likely to give rise to noise disturbance. The proposal would therefore be detrimental to the amenity of the occupants of these properties contrary to policies 4.1, 4.11 and 5.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan,  'Plan for the Environment', 2004 and to Supplementary Planning Guidance 10 - Noise and Vibration."
