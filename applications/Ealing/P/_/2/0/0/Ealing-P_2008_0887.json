    "The proposed extension, by reason of its position, depth and height, would result in an overdevelopment that would be out of character with the area and would also fail to retain adequate provision of outdoor amenity space for the occupiers of the existing flats at the property. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 5.and 9.1 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance note 13: 'Garden Space'."
