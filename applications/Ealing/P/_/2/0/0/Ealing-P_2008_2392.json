A scheme shall then be submitted and approved by the local planning authority to describe the proposed methods of removal, neutralising or sealing of the contamination, and for the remedial works to be implemented before any other works commence.  Reason: In the interests of health and safety, in accordance with policy 2.7 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | Refuse and recycling storage, in accordance with the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority, shall be provided as detailed on drawing number 15000-A-OO-03-001 Rev A received 28th October 2008.
