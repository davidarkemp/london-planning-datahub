    "The proposed extension by reason of its size, scale, design, and visual impact from Rotherwick Hill would constitute an obtrusive and incongruous feature, which would detract from the appearance of the dwelling house, and be detrimental to the character of the property and the Conservation Area as a whole. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8, 5.5 and 5.9 of the Adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004)."
