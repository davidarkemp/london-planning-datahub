    "The proposed conversion would result in a cramped development with substandard accommodation and result in the overintensification of the use of the site which would be harmful to the living conditions of future occupiers of the units and also current, and future occupiers of neighbouring properties. This would be contrary to the Unitary Development Plans adopted policies B1, B5, H26, SG3 and UDP replacement policies 4.1, 5.5. | The proposed ground floor extension, extension to the rear roof slope, installation of roof lights to the front roof slope, terraces, and external alterations would not be inkeeping with the character and style of this Victorian building which would harm the visual appearance of the building and the area which is designated as a conservation area. This would be contrary to the Unitary Development Plans adopted policies B1, ES6, B24, H8, H26, and UDP replacement policies 4.1, 4.8, 5.5, and 5.9. | The proposed roof terraces would harm the living conditions of neighbouring residents by overlooking and disturbance.
