    "The proposed single storey side extension with three roof lights, by reason of its design and external detailing, would result in a discordant form of development detrimental of the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the Cuckoo Estate Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1,4.8, 5.5, and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and to the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2006). | The proposed development would result in a loss of an existing on-site car parking space for which there is no adequate provision for replacement off-street parking. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1 and 9.1 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document 8: 'Crossovers and Parking in Front Gardens' (2006)."
