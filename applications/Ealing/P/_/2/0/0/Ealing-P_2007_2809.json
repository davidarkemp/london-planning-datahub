    "1.   The design, appearance and detailing of the prominent frontage block in relation to both Creswick Road and Springfield Gardens Public Open Space is incoherent and poor and therefore fails to provide a suitable replacement development to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the locality and the height and siting of this building in relation to the Western boundary and its resultant overbearing relationship with Jubilee Court fails to respect the spacious detached character of development in Creswick Road. The development is therefore contrary to Policies 3.4, 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Unitary development Plan 2004 \"Plan for the Environment\". | 2.   The design, appearance and detailing of the rear block is unsatisfactory and this together with the siting of this block in relation to the Springfield Gardens boundary and frontage block will result in development of a prominent backland area that fails to respect the form of local development and the open spacious character of this site that provides a foreground to St. Vincent's School; and has a detrimental impact on views from Springfield Gardens Public Open Space. The development is therefore contrary to Policies 3.4, 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan 2004 \"Plan for the Environment\"."
