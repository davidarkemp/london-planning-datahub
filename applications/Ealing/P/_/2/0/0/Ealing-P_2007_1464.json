    "The proposed development would result in the loss of a small family dwelling for which there is a continuing need within the Borough. The loss of this small house would undermine the Councils objectives for the supply of a mixed and balanced provision of residential accommodation. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 5.6 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The proposed development would fail to provide on-site parking to serve the two units and the development would be likely to lead to increased demand for on-street parking and exacerbate parking stress in the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 5.5 and 9.1 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The proposed development fails to indicate the provision of any private outdoor amenity space for the first floor flat. It is therefore not possible to determine whether appropriate provision would be made available for the occupiers of the development and in any event no access is shown to be provided from the first/second floor flat to the rear garden of the property. As such, the proposal conflicts with policy 5.6 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the Councils adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance note 13 - Garden Space. | The submitted planning application and drawings include inaccuracies between the original house footprint and that shown and misrepresenting the situation and original floor area. Therefore, the Council is unable to fully assess this development and in the absence of further details, it is considered that the proposals would give rise to an unacceptable development of detriment to the character and amenity of the property and locality and also be contrary to the Adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan For the Environment' (2004) policies"
