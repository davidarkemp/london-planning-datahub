    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, siting and design, would represent a visually obtrusive and incongrous extension, out of keeping with the character of the existing building and the general pattern of development in the area.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and supplementary planning document SPD4 'Residential Extensions'. | The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its size, scale, depth and proximity to the site boundary shared with 24 King Edwards Gardens, would have an unacceptable impact on the living conditions of this property by way of loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook, and an increased sense of enclosure.  As such, the proposed development is contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and supplementary planning document SPD4 'Residential Extensions'."
