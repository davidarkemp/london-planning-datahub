    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  Reason:\tIn order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | Notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in the planning application, no development shall take place until full details of both hard and soft landscaping works, ground levels and full details of proposed boundary treatment and any retaining walls, have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, and these works shall be carried out as approved prior to first occupation of the development and thereafter permanently maintained, or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Any trees or other plants, which die or are removed within the first five years following the implementation of the landscaping scheme, shall be replaced during the next planting season.  Reason:  To ensure that the development is landscaped in the interests of the environment and the appearance of the area, and to protect the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policies 4.5 and 5.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | Notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in the planning application, no development shall take place until full details of vehicular and pedestrian access (including vehicular crossover) have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, and these works shall be carried out as approved prior to first occupation of the development and thereafter permanently maintained, or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: In the interests of pedestrian and highway safety, in accordance with policies 1.9, 9.1 and 9.9 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | Samples of the materials to be used for the external surfaces of the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any part of the development is commenced, and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application. Development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details.  Reason: To ensure that the appearance of the development is compatible with the existing character of development in the area, in accordance with policies 1.4, 4.1 and 5.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | Prior to the commencement of any earth works on site, a contaminated land investigation shall be carried out, using sampling points and methods agreed with the local planning authority and subsequently a risk assessment shall be prepared, following the CLEA guidance. A scheme shall then be submitted and approved by the local planning authority to describe the proposed methods of removal, neutralising or sealing of the contamination, and for the remedial works to be implemented before any other works commence.  Reason: In the interests of health and safety, in accordance with policy 2.7 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | Refuse and recycling storage, in accordance with the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority, shall be provided as detailed on drawing number 1002-D2000-rev09 received 21st August 2007. Such provision shall be implemented prior to the first occupation of the development hereby permitted and permanently retained, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of residents of the area and in the interests of the environment and the street scene, in accordance with policies 2.10 and 5.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Guidance Note 4: Refuse and Recycling Facilities. | The dwellings hereby approved shall be constructed to Lifetime Homes Standards and level access shall be provided to the ground floor accommodation and external areas prior to first occupation. These measures shall relate to the internal and external areas of the development and shall be in place prior to the occupation of any part of the development hereby approved and permanently retained thereafter, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To provide adaptable and accessible living accommodation for people with impaired mobility, in accordance with policies 4.1, 5.3 and 5.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Guidance 7: Accessible Ealing. | The proposed parking provision and cycle parking detailed on drawing number 1002-D2000-rev09 received 21st August 2007 shall be kept continuously available for car parking and shall not be used for any other purpose, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To ensure that there is adequate provision for car parking at the site and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with policies 1.9, 9.1, 9.6 and 9.9 of the adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The design of the dwellings shall comply with the aims and objectives of Secured by Design and such measures shall be brought into place prior to the occupation of the development hereby approved and thereafter retained, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Reason: To ensure that the proposed development achieves the required crime prevention elements as detailed by Government Circular 5/94 'Planning Out Crime', with the requirements of Clause 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which imposes a duty on a Local Authority 'to do all that it can to prevent crime and disorder in its area', and with policy 4.4 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Guidance 8: 'Safer Ealing'. | Any flat roof to be created as part of the development shall not be used to form a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area.  Reason: To protect the living conditions of nearby properties in accordance with policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004)."
