    "The proposal represents an undesirable overdevelopment of the site which would result in a cramped development, including poor building layout and inadequate amenity space, harmful to the living conditions of future occupants of the site, contrary policies 4.1, 5.1 and 5.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 'New Plan for the Environment' and Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) 14. | The proposal, by reason of its bulk, scale and siting is out of character with the general style and pattern of development in the area, harmful to the street scene and to the visual character of the area contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 'New Plan for the Environment'. | The proposed Mews development by reason of its scale, bulk and siting would result in overshadowing and an overbearing relationship, creating a harmful effect on the living conditions currently enjoyed by the residents and occupiers of adjoining properties, contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 'New Plan for the Environment'. | The proposed access points would provide inadequate visibility for vehicles emerging from the application site, prejudicing the free flow and safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, contrary to policy 9.1 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 'New Plan for the Environment'. | The vehicular entrance, leading to the rear of the site, fails to make provision for two-way traffic, prejudicing the free flow and safety of vehicular traffic to the detriment of highway safety, contrary to policy 9.1 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 'New Plan for the Environment'. | The crossovers, for the proposed town houses, would not meet the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority, compromising pedestrian safety along Acton Lane, contrary to policy 9.1 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 'New Plan for the Environment'. | The proposal would not meet the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority, failing to make adequate provision for accessible transport, serving people with disabilities and others with mobility difficulties, inconsistent with policies 9.1 and 9.7 the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 'New Plan for the Environment'. | The pedestrian arrangement to serve the proposed development would be inadequate and unsafe, contrary to policies 4.1, 5.5, 9.1 and 9.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 'New Plan for the Environment'. | On the basis of the information submitted, the proposed driveway and parking spaces 01 and 02 would unacceptably damage the tree roots and canopy of nearby trees that provide amenity value to surrounding residences, contrary to policy 4.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 'New Plan for the Environment'."
