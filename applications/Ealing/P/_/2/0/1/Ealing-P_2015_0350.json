    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  REASON:\tIn order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title number(s) CR007 Revision A04, CR008 Revision A06, CR010 Revision A06, CR010 Revision A06, CR011 Revision A06, CR012 Revision A06.   Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.  REASON:\tTo ensure that the materials harmonise with the existing building and surrounding area, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policies 1.1 (g) (h), 1.2 (f) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan - Consolidated (2015). | Refuse storage shall be provided in accordance with the standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority.  Such provision shall be brought into use prior to the occupation of the development and retained permanently.  REASON: To protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area, in accordance with policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Plan 2013, policies 1.1(e) (g) and (j) of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and The London Plan - Consolidated (2015) policy 5.16. | A minimum of seven (7) cycle parking spaces shall be provided on site in accordance with adopted standards of the London Plan - Consolidated (2015). Such provision shall be brought into use prior to first occupation and retained permanently.  Reason:\tTo provide adequate facilities for cyclists, in accordance with policy 6.9 of the Adopted Ealing Development Management Plan 2013 and policy 6.9 of the London Plan - Consolidated (2015). | Before any part of the development hereby permitted is first occupied arrangements shall have been made to secure a car-free development in accordance with a detailed scheme or agreement which has been approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved scheme or agreement must ensure that:  a) all occupiers of the one bed flat and one of the two bed flats cannot apply for, obtain or hold an on-street parking permit to park a vehicle on the public highway within the administrative district of the local planning authority (other than a disabled person's badge issued pursuant to section 21 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 or similar legislation); b) all occupiers of the one bed flat and one of the two bed flats are required to surrender any such permit wrongly issued or held; and c) such a scheme or agreement shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall be retained and operated for so long as the use hereby permitted continues.  Reason: To ensure that the development is car-free and does not exacerbate on-street parking pressure in the local controlled parking zone in accordance with policy 6.13 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document, policies 1.1 (f) (g) of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 6.3 and 6.13 of the London Plan - Consolidated (2015). | Prior to the commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval for the insulation of the building envelope, with windows shut and other means of ventilation provided, which will achieve the internal criteria for sensitive rooms, as specified in Interim SPG10, using the specified worst mode one hour LAeq,1hr spectrum noise level. The details should also include the provision of alternative means of ventilation in each room in accordance with Authority's criteria.  The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.  Reason: In the interests of the internal environment of the development and to safeguard the occupants from the effect of road noise, in accordance with policies 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy 7.15 of the London Plan (2015), Interim Supplementary Planning Guidance 10"
