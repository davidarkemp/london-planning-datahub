    "The family sized dwellings at the rear of the site represent an undesirable and cramped form of backland development that would be detrimental to the amenities of the prospective residents of these units, the appearance and character of the development, the spatial characteristics of the area and the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring residential properties. by reason of : - the inadequate depth and size and undesirable nature of the private usable amenity space proposed at basement level and surrounded by high boundary walls and the relatively tall terraces, which will result in this area being in shadow and of limited usefulness, contrary to the standards set out in Supplementary Planning Guidance 13 'Garden Space'.  - the unsatisfactory lighting to and outlook from the basement habitable room onto this private amenity space and a very restricted lightwell on the opposite side of the building  - the undesirable outlook from the ground floor habitable room on the West side and the poor relationship of this room to the frontage car parking space. - the inappropriate relationship of the car parking spaces to the terraces and lack of frontage soft landscaping opportunities which will offer a poor setting for the development. - the height and length of the terraces that will detract from the outlook from neighbouring properties.   - The proposed terraced houses and four of the proposed flats do not satisfy the lifetime home standards The development would therefore be contrary to policies 4.1, 4.3 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004. | The provision of a single vehicle width access gate at the entrance to the development with insufficient set back to allow two vehicles to pass clear of the public highway will result in vehicles stopping and queuing on the public highway close to the junction of Church Road and Cherington Road with its inherent problems associated with the siting of the site access close to this junction and the approach and speed of traffic from Church Road into the one way Cherington Road, which will result in conditions detrimental to free flow of traffic and pedestrian and general highway safety on the local road system, contrary to policies 4.1 and 9.1 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004. | The development provides inadequate car parking within the site and with no adequate mitigation measures proposed the proposal will give rise to on street parking in an area that is already subject to significant levels of on street parking to the detriment of the general and residential amenities of the locality, the free flow of traffic and conditions of general highway safety on the neighbouring roads contrary to policies 4.1 and 9.1 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004. | The siting,  height and resultant bulk of the upper floor flat development in relation to the trees to be retained would require construction and associated works to be carried out within their root protection zones and due to the proximity to habitable room windows could lead to requests for the future pruning and removal of the subject trees which make a significant contribution to the streetscene. The proposal also fails to provide sufficient information regarding the provision of underground infrastructure and other works within the root protection zones. The proposal may therefore result in the future loss and/or detrimental works to these prominently located trees that are the subject of a Tree Preservation Order, contrary to policies 4.1, 4.5 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Guidance 9 ' Trees and Development Guidelines'. | The proposal provides inadequate private usable amenity space for the occupiers of the residential units and inadequate children's play space within the development and offers no adequate mitigation measures to the detriment of the amenities of the prospective residents and contrary to policies 3.5, 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and Supplementary Planning Guidance 13 'Garden Space'. | The provision of private gardens with demarcations and patios on the frontage to the flat development at this prominent corner location would detract from the setting of the development and have a detrimental impact on the visual amenities of the locality contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004. | The proposal would have an impact on local infrastructure, in particular education and healthcare facilities and no measures have been agreed under a planning obligation to address these impacts, contrary to Policy 1.10 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004."
