    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: Drawing No. 02A Rev A and 03 Rev A.  Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning. | Given the nature of the proposed amendments, and taking into account the original planning conditions, the proposal would meet the Council's criteria for non-material amendments to planning applications due to the following reasons:  -\tThere would be no material impact on any neighbours or other statutory and non-statutory bodies, and the resulting scheme would remain within the description of development on the decision notice, the correct fee has been paid and the proposal accords with the adopted policies of the Council.  -\tThe resulting scheme would not have a poorer design by reason of loss of detail or lower quality materials.  Therefore the proposal represents a 'non-material' change from the original planning permission with regard to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), and will not require full assessment through the submission of a full planning application."
