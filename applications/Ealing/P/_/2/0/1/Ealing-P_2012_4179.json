    "1.\tThe proposed subdivision and construction of a separate dwelling at no. 30 Farndale Crescent, by reason of its design would result in a dwelling that is not in keeping with the character and pattern of development in the area. This development would be visually incongruous due to its flat roof, width of curtilage, scale and design features which do not reflect those of neighbouring residences. This would be detrimental to the visual and residential character of the area as a whole, contrary to policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment'(2004). | 2.\tThe proposed subdivision and construction of a separate dwelling at no. 30 Farndale Crescent, by reason of its internal floor area would result in a dwelling that fails to meet standards of good quality design. This is contrary to policy 3.5 of the London Plan, and inconsistent with policies 4.1 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment'(2004)."
