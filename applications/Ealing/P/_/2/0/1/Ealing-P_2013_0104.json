REASON : To ensure the site is appropriate for residential use, in accordance with policy 5.21 of the London Plan (2011), policies 1.1(e) and (j) of the adopted Ealing Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation to London Plan policy 7.21 of the draft Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policy 2.7 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | Prior to first occupation of any part of the development details of flood warning procedures to be utilised to give occupiers of the development sufficient warning of a likely flood event, to allow them time to prepare for such a situation and put in place appropriate measures to allow protection of people, goods and possessions, shall be submitted to and approved, in writing, by the Local Planning Authority. Once approved the procedures shall be put in place prior to first occupation of any part of the development and shall thereafter be permanently retained.  REASON : In order to ensure residents of the development are adequately protected in the event of a flooding incident, in accordance with policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2011), policies 1.1(k) and 1.2(m) of the adopted Ealing Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation to London Plan policy 5.12 of the draft Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policy 2.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | No development shall take place until details of the implementation, maintenance and management of the sustainable drainage scheme have been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall be implemented before first occupation of any part of the development and shall thereafter be managed and maintained in accordance with the approved details. Those details shall include : i.\ta timetable for its implementation ; and   ii.\ta management and maintenance plan for the lifetime of the development which shall include the arrangements for adoption by any public body or statutory undertaker, or any other arrangements to secure the operation of the sustainable drainage scheme throughout its lifetime.  REASON : To ensure the development does not have any adverse impact on existing      drainage, in accordance with policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2011), policies 1.1(k) and 1.2(m) of the adopted Ealing Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation to London Plan policy 5.12 of the draft Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policy 2.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | There shall be no raising of existing site levels as part of the development, or once the development has been completed.  REASON : In order to prevent any potential flood water displacement, in accordance with policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2011), policies 1.1(k) and 1.2(m) of the adopted Ealing Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation to London Plan policy 5.12 of the draft Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policy 2.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | Details of the materials and finishes to be used for the external surfaces of the development shall be submitted to and approved, in writing, by the Local Planning Authority before any part of the development is commenced. The development shall be implemented only in accordance with these approved details, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. REASON : To ensure the materials and finishes harmonise with the surroundings and enhance the St.Mark's and Canal Conservation Area, in accordance with policies 3.5, 7.1, 7.4, 7.6, 7.8, 7.17 and 7.30 of the adopted London Plan (2011), policies 1.1(g), (h) and (k), 1.2(f), (g) and (h), 2.1(c), 2.10, 5.2(f) and 5.3(a) and (d) of the adopted Ealing Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variations to London Plan policy 7.4 and policies 7B and 7C of the draft Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policies 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.8 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) | A) No development shall take place until the applicant has secured the implementation of a programme of archaeological mitigation with a Written Scheme of Investigation which has been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority ; B) No development or demolition shall take place other than in accordance with the Written Scheme of Investigation approved under Part A) ; C) The development shall not be occupied until the site investigation and post investigation assessment has been completed in accordance with the programme set out in the Written Scheme of Investigation approved under Part A) and the provision made for analysis, publication and dissemination of the results and archive deposition has been secured. REASON : Heritage assets of archaeological interest may survive on the site. The planning authority wishes to secure the provision of an archaeological investigation and the subsequent recording of the remains prior to development, in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7.8 of the adopted London Plan (2011) and policy 4.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Deve lopment Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004). | The works to remove the present two-storey building shall retain the brick wall at its present height along the Northern boundary of the site, with, where necessary, restoration of the wall and this wall shall thereafter be retained as a brick wall at its present height and shall not be altered or lowered except with the prior written permission of the Local Planning Authority.   Reason : To safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of 10 Oak Villas and other neighbouring properties and in the interests of the amenities of the St. Mark's and Canal Conservation Area in pursuance of policies 7.1, 7.4, 7.6  and 7.8 of the adopted London Plan (2011), policies 1.1 (g) and (h) and 2.10 of the adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 4.1, 4.8 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan (2004)  and policies 7B and 7C of the Draft Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) | The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced until such time as a scheme to ensure access to/improvement/protection and maintenance of existing flood defences has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority.  The scheme shall be fully implemented and subsequently maintained, in accordance with the timing / phasing arrangements embodied within the scheme, or within any other period as may subsequently be agreed, in writing, by the local planning authority.   Reason : To ensure the structural integrity of existing flood defences thereby reducing the risk of flooding in accordance with policy 5.12 of the adopted London Plan, policies 1.1 (k) and 1.2 (m) of the adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation to London Plan policy 5.12 of the draft Ealing Development Managaement Development Plan Document (2013) and policy 2.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) .  (The Flood Risk Assessment indicates that the walls along the western and northern site boundaries are sufficiently high to protected the site against flooding up to 1 in 20 year event - however the structural survey carried out by the applicant casts doubt on the stability of the walls in their present state) . | The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced until such time as a scheme to ensure provision of compensatory flood storage has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority.  The scheme shall be fully implemented and subsequently maintained, in accordance with the timing / phasing arrangements embodied within the scheme, or within any other period as may subsequently be agreed, in writing, by the local planning authority.   Reason : To prevent flooding elsewhere by ensuring that compensatory storage of flood water is provided in accordance with policy 5.12 of the adopted London Plan, policies 1.1 (k) and 1.2 (m) of the adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation to London Plan policy 5.12 of the draft Ealing Development Managaement Development Plan Document (2013) and policy 2.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004).   (The Flood Risk Assessment indicates that the two existing buildings on site have a combined non-floodable footprint of 79m2; whilst the proposed buildings have a non-floodable footprint of 42m2. Table 2 of the Flood Risk Assessment indicates that the changes in these non-floodable areas would result in an increase in flood storage (volume) on site - however this analysis is too simplistic and fails to consider the impact of the proposed 173m2 of floodable garage, store room and entrance lobby.  A full level for level compensation analysis considering volume is required to demonstrate that the proposed development will not result in a loss of flood storage and increase in flood risk in the surrounding area). | The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced until such time as a scheme to assess the increased flood risk development behind defences has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority.  The scheme shall be fully implemented and subsequently maintained, in accordance with the timing / phasing arrangements embodied within the scheme, or within any other period as may subsequently be agreed, in writing, by the local planning authority.   Reason : To ensure the structural integrity of the proposed dwellings thereby reducing the risk of flooding to future occupants in accordance with policy 5.12 of the adopted London Plan, policies 1.1 (k) and 1.2 (m) of the adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation to London Plan policy 5.12 of the draft Ealing Development Managaement Development Plan Document (2013) and policy 2.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004).   (Buildings should be designed to withstand the effects of flooding. In areas of high velocity water, buildings should be structurally designed to withstand the expected water pressures, potential debris impacts and erosion which may occur during a flood event. Particular care should be taken in the design of any building located in a Rapid Inundation Zone). The letter in appendix C of the Flood Risk Assessment indicates that in the opinion of Elite Designers the structures can be amended to accommodate all loading which may be applied from flood waters over the life time of the new building'. However it is indicated that further detailed analysis is required.  In assessing the residual flood risk associated with overtopping, the following factors should be taken into account but have not been addressed:  o How long it would take for water to drain from the flooded area following an overtopping;  and  o The velocity of flood water flowing across the site following a overtopping of the defences) | The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced until such time as a scheme to incorporate 1 in 5 floodable void design up to the design event for all external walls and doors of the areas of dwellings proposed as floodable (garage, storage room and lobby) has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority.  The scheme shall be fully implemented and subsequently maintained, in accordance with the timing / phasing arrangements embodied within the scheme, or within any other period as may subsequently be agreed, in writing, by the local planning authority.   Reason : To prevent flooding elsewhere by ensuring that compensatory storage of flood water is provided and to reduce impedance to flood flows in accordance with policy 5.12 of the adopted London Plan, policies 1.1 (k) and 1.2 (m) of the adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation to London Plan policy 5.12 of the draft Ealing Development Managaement Development Plan Document (2013) and policy 2.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004).   (It is clear that these floodable areas will from the outset not be empty voids, thus resulting in a direct loss of flood storage compared with the existing floodplain - it is therefore essential that flood water can enter these areas with the minimum of impedance. To achieve this, voids should be incorporated into the external walls and doors of the proposed floodable areas at a 1 to 5 ratio ie 1m opening per 5m. The opening should extend up to the design event). | The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced until such time as a scheme to incorporate 1 in 5 floodable void design up to the design event for all walls or fencing constructed within or around the site has been submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority.  The scheme shall be fully implemented and subsequently maintained, in accordance with the timing / phasing arrangements embodied within the scheme, or within any other period as may subsequently be agreed, in writing, by the local planning authority.   Reason : To prevent the increased risk of flooding due to impedance of flood flows in accordance with policy 5.12 of the adopted London Plan, policies 1.1 (k) and 1.2 (m) of the adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation to London Plan policy 5.12 of the draft Ealing Development Managaement Development Plan Document (2013) and policy 2.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004).  . (To achieve this, voids should be incorporated into all walls or fencing constructed within or around the site at a 1 to 5 ratio i.e. 1m opening per 5m. The opening should extend up to the design event)."
