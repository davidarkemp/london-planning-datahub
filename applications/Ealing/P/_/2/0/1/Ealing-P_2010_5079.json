    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its dimensions, proportions and siting, in conjunction with the existing extensions; would represent an overdevelopment of this modest detached property that would cumulatively alter its original proportions, and affect its appearance and character, detracting from the established character and appearance of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.8 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and the advice contained in the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2004) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Design Guidelines."
