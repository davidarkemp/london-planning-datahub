Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning. | The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.  REASON: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.  REASON:\tTo ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 4.1, 5.5, and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, Plan for the Environment (2004) and London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6. | No development (including initial site-clearance) shall commence until a detailed scheme for the protection of existing trees, hedgerows and groups of mature shrubs to be retained, in accordance with British Standard 5837:2005 +Trees In Relation To Construction Recommendations+ (or any subsequent revision), has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Protection measures shall be phased as necessary to take into account and provide protection during demolition/site clearance works - all construction works - hard landscaping works.  Details shall include the following: -  a)\tAccurate trunk positions and canopy spreads of all existing trees within the site and on adjoining land adjacent to the development. b)\tPositions and spreads of existing hedgerows and groups of mature shrubs. c)\tAll proposed tree, hedge, shrub removal and retention. d)\tMinimum +Root Protection Areas+ of all existing retained trees within the site and on neighbouring land adjacent to the approved development, calculated in accordance with BS 5837 recommendations. e)\tPlans of a minimum scale of 1:200 (unless agreed otherwise by the Local Authority) showing the proposed locations of 2.3m high protective barrier/s, supported by a metal scaffold framework, constructed in accordance with Section 9 (Figure 2), to include appropriate weatherproof tree protection area signage (such as +Keep Out - Construction Exclusion Zone+) securely fixed to the outside of the protective fencing structure at regular intervals. f)\tProposed ground protection measures in accordance with Section 9 (Figure 3) g)\tAnnotated minimum distances between fencing and trunks of retained trees at regular intervals. h)\tIllustration/s of the proposed fencing structure/s to be erected.   REASON: - In order to safeguard trees and other vegetation considered to be worthy of retention in the interests of the visual amenity of the area, in accordance with policies 3.2 and 4.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Guidance 9 'Trees and Development Guidance' and Policy 7.21 of the London Plan (2011). | The protective fencing and other protection measures specified by the previous condition shall be erected in the locations agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of any development works, including any initial clearance, and shall be maintained fully intact and (in the case of the fencing) upright, in its approved locations at all times, until the completion of all building operations on the site (unless agreed otherwise in writing by the Local Planning Authority). Where phased protection measures have been approved, no works shall commence on the next phase of the development until the protective fencing barriers and other protective measures have been repositioned for that phase in full accordance with the approved details. No activity of any description must occur at any time within these areas including but not restricted to the following: -  a)\tNo mixing of cement or any other materials. b)\tStorage or disposal of any soil, building materials, rubble, machinery, fuel, chemicals, liquids waste residues or materials/debris of any other description. c)\tSiting of any temporary structures of any description including site office/sales buildings, temporary car parking facilities, porta-loos, storage compounds or hard standing areas of any other description. d)\tSoil/turf stripping, raising/lowering of existing levels, excavation or alterations to the existing surfaces/ ground conditions of any other description. e)\tInstallation/siting of any underground services, temporary or otherwise including; drainage, water, gas, electricity, telephone, television, external lighting or any associated ducting. f)\tParking/use of tracked or wheeled machinery or vehicles of any description.  In addition to the protection measures specified above: -  a)\tNo fires shall be lit within 20 metres of the trunks of any trees or the centre line of any hedgerow shown to be retained. b)\tNo signs, cables, fixtures or fittings of any other description shall be attached to any part of any retained tree.   REASON: - In order to safeguard trees and other vegetation considered to be worthy of retention in the interests of the visual amenity of the area, in accordance with policies 3.2 and 4.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Guidance 9 'Trees and Development Guidance' and Policy 7.21 of the London Plan (2011). | No development shall commence until a detailed site specific construction method statement for all hard surfaced areas of any description within the minimum root protection areas of retained trees calculated in accordance with British Standard 5837:2005 +Trees In Relation To Construction Recommendations+, or any subsequent revision, has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  Details shall be based on a porous +No-Dig+ principle of construction, avoiding any excavation of existing levels in all areas concerned, and shall include: -  a) An approved development layout plan identifying all areas where special construction measures are to be undertaken. b) Details of the removal of all existing hard surfaced areas and structures of any description. c) Materials including porous surface finish. d) Construction profile/s showing existing /proposed finished levels together with any grading of levels proposed adjacent to the footprint in each respective structure. d) Program and method of implementation.  All +No-Dig+ Constructions shall be implemented in full accordance with the approved details.   REASON: In order to alleviate any adverse impact on the root systems and the long term health of retained trees, in the interests of the environment and the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policy 4.5 of the Council's adopted Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and Supplementary Planning Guidance 9 'Trees and Development Guidance' and Policy 7.21 of the London Plan (2011)."
