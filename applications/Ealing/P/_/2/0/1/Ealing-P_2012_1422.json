    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced before the expiration of three years from the date of this consent.   Reason: To comply with the provisions of Sections 18 (As Amended) and 74 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to review the situation at the end of this period if the development has not begun. | Demolition of the building shall not take place except in the case of implementing a scheme for the redevelopment of the site for which the Local Planning Authority has granted full planning permission.  Reason:  To prevent premature demolition and the creation of a cleared site which would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the area and adversely affect its character, in accordance with policies 4.1, 4.5 and 4.8 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) and policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2011)."
