    "Given the nature of the proposed amendments, and taking into account the original planning conditions, the proposal would meet the Councils' criteria for non-material amendments by virtue that there would be no material impact on any neighbours, it would not materially alter the appearance of the development and would not impact upon any other statutory or non-statutory body, and the resulting scheme remains within the description of development on the decision notice, the fee paid and is within the adopted policies of the Council.  Therefore the proposal represents a 'non-material' change from the original planning permission with regard to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), and will not require full assessment through the submission of a full planning application."
