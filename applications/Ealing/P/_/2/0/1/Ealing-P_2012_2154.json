Reason: To safeguard the architectural and/or historic interest of the building and the Ealing Town Centre Conservation Area, in accordance with policy 4.6 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' 2004 and the Ealing Town Centre Conservation Area Management Plan (2007) and policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2011)."
