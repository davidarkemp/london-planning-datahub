    "The proposed development falls within `Schedule 2 Development`, as the area of the development exceeds 0.5 hectares and falls within the definition of infrastructure projects (10(b) Urban development projects). | The proposed development has been `screened`, having regard to the selection criteria for screening schedule 2 development set out in `Schedule 3`; namely having regard to (i) the characteristics of development; (ii) the location of development, and (iii) the characteristics of the potential impact. | On this basis the Local Planning Authority is of the opinion that the proposed development will not be likely to have significant effects on the environment as interpreted by the EIA Regulations 1999; and thereby does not constitute EIA development requiring an Environmental Statement. This is not to say that the proposed development will not have environmental effects of a localised nature, which will need to be considered in determining any planning application(s)."
