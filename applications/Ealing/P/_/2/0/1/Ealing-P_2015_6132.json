As such, the proposal is not considered to be compliant with The London Plan (consolidated - 2015) polices 7.4 (local character) & 7.6 (architecture), Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7A (amenity) & 7B (design amenity) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area Management Plan, Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and section 12 The National Planning Policy Framework (2012)."
