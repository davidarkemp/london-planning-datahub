    "The proposed development, due to the proposed design of the raised stairwell enclosures to the front elevation, which would be visually dominant and would disrupt the roofline of the building, would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the streetscene and character of the locality. As such, the development is contrary to policies 4.1, 4.5 and 5.5 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan - Spatial Development Strategy for Greater London (July 2011) and the advice contained within the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Document 4: 'Residential Extensions' (2006). | The proposed development, due to the limited internal living space to be provided for the one bedroom flats, the poor internal layout that would not meet the Council's adopted Lifetime Homes standards in respect of the w.c.'s and the accessibility to the area of communal amenity space, which would be poorly related to the proposed new dwellings, would fail to meet the minimum gross internal areas specified in the development plan for the area and would provide substandard residential accommodation for prospective occupiers. As such, the proposal conflicts with policies 4.1, 5.3, 5.5 and 5.9 of the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), policies 3.4, 3.5, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan - Spatial Development Strategy for Greater London (July 2011) and the Council's adopted Supplementary Planning Guidance note 13: 'Garden Space'. | The proposed development, in the absence of any planning obligation with regard to the provision of appropriate Car Club provision and membership for occupiers of the proposed development, would be likely to result in parking stress in the area. As such, the development is contrary to policies 1.10, 9.1 and 9.8 of the adopted Ealing Unitary development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004)."
