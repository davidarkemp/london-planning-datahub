    "The proposed development, by reason of scale, massing and proximity to boundaries shared with adjoining properties, would have an undue harm on the residential amenities of neighbouring properties through loss of  sunlight/daylight and visual outlook. In addition, the proposed side dormer windows would compromise the privacy of neighbouring windows. The proposed development would therefore fail to respect the residential amenities of neighbouring residents and would not be consistent with Section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015), policies 1.1, 1.2 and 4.1 of the adopted Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies ELV 7.4, 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of design, scale, roof profile, siting and footprint, would break a generally consistent building separation between the stretch of houses and would represent an overdevelopment for the site. The proposed building would fail to relate to the form, fa√ßade treatment and detailing of neighbouring houses and would therefore have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the site. As such, the proposed development would be visually incongruous and overbearing and would not be in keeping with the general character of the area and street scene. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2012), policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2015), policies 1.1, 1.2 and 4.1 of the adopted Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies ELV 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013)."
