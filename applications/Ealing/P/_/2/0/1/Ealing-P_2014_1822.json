    "1)\tThe use of the single-storey outbuilding and its use as a residential bedsit/dwelling by virtue of its self-containment and lack of ancillary functions to the main property is out of character with the pattern of development in the surrounding area and is detrimental to the amenities of the current and future occupiers of both the premises and the neighbouring residential properties by reason of noise and disturbance associated with separate residential use. The use of the outbuilding as a dwelling also results in a loss of outlook and privacy to the detriment of occupiers of the outbuilding, the main building at the premises, and neighbouring properties.   As such, the use of the outbuilding as a dwelling is contrary to policies 3.5, 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of the adopted London Plan (2011) and Policies 3.5, 7A, 7B and 7.4 of Ealing's Adopted Development Management DPD (2013). | 2)\tThe use of the outbuilding as a bedsit/dwelling by reasons of its inadequate indoor living space creates cramped and substandard living conditions to the detriment of the current and future occupiers of the outbuilding. As such the outbuilding is contrary to the minimum standards set out in Table 3.3 of the London Plan 2011, the London Housing Design Guidance and the London Housing SPG. | 3)\tThe self-contained residential bedsit/dwelling lacks adequate outside amenity space to the detriment of the amenities of current and future occupiers of the premises contrary to SPD 4 for Residential Extensions and contrary to Policy 7D of Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013)."
