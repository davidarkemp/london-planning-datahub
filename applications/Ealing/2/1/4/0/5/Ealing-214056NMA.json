    "The proposal cannot be accepted as a non-material amendment to planning permission Ref: 200893FUL dated: 23/09/2020, in respect S96A of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for Non-Material amendments following a grant of Planning Permission (2011), as it would constitute an increase in the scale of the approved development compromising its design and appearance. The resultant dwelling would not be consistent with the approved proposal description in that it would add an additional storey to the dwelling. The size of the resultant dwelling would provide a continuous enlongated dormer window across the original and proposed dwelling and cumulatively with the hip-to-gable alteration would have a material impact on the visual amenity of the surrounding area. Accordingly, the proposal would represent a poorer design outcome in relation to the approved dwelling. In addition, this application also proposes a dormer over the original dwelling house, which does not form part of the original application. Furthermore, the proposal results in an increase in the number of bedrooms within the dwelling and therefore, the quality of the proposed residential accommodation will need to be assessed in accordance with London Plan policy. Given the above, the proposed changes cannot be considered to be non-material amendments and planning permission is required."
