    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title(s) 1 (Existing Plans); 2 (Existing Section and Elevations); 3 (Existing Elevations); 4 rev E (Proposed Plans); 5 rev E (Proposed Elevations); 6 rev E (Proposed Elevations); Arboricultural Report by Frank Parsons Arboriculturalist (20 July 2021); FP/TS/261 (Tree Survey); Email from Great West Design, dated 29/09/2021",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | Notwithstanding the details shown on the plans, all external materials to be used in the development shall be those as mentioned on the application form, including brick and timber cladding. The brick shall match that of the brick used on the main dwelling house.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The detached outbuilding hereby approved shall only be used for domestic purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the main dwelling at 8 Aston Road, Ealing, London, W5 2RL and shall not be used for any separate residential or commercial use. No kitchen facilities shall be installed at any time.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | No trees, shrubs or hedges within the site which are shown to be retained on the approved plans, including the adjacent TPO, shall be felled, uprooted, damaged or destroyed, cut back in any way or removed without previous written consent of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Any shrubs or hedges removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming seriously diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced with shrubs or hedge plants or similar species capable of achieving a comparable size unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.",
    "The local authority shall receive the full CAVAT value, or a proportion reflecting the damage /decline in tree health, for all trees: removed without consent, or dying, or being severely damaged, or becoming seriously diseased (crown more than 50% sparse), within 5 years from the start of work on the development hereby permitted. This financial penalty shall be sought, unless the Local Planning Authority has given written consent to any variation.",
    "Reason: to secure the protection throughout the time that development is being carried out, of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within the site which are of important amenity value to the local landscape."
