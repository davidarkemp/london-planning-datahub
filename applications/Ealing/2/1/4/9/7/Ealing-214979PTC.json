  "description": "T1 - Purple leaf plum - Front garden - TPO/2008/0332\n\n- Cut the damaged limb whilst retaining the first cluster of water shoots. \n\n- Reduce the long lateral limbs by approx. 1.5 metres all around the tree in order to lessen the loading forces on the heavy limbs. \n\n- Retain all internal growth and try to maintain as much of the low hanging foliage as possible. \n\n- The goal here is to maintain the tree at a smaller size to reduce the risk of further branch tear-out whilst retaining a natural crown structure. Some of the higher foliage will be reduced to blend the newly reduced sides into the form of the tree.",
