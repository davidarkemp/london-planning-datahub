The measures shall ensure that the external rating noise level LAeq emitted will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity. A post installation sound assessment shall be carried out where required to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and additional steps to mitigate noise shall be taken, as necessary.  Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation/ use of plant/ machinery/ equipment and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason:  To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to the use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",

The Annual Total Avoided Energy Use Analysis of the M&V Plan should be submitted to the Council during the monitoring period.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development hereby approved is energy efficient and to contribute to the avoidance of need for new fossil fuel or primary energy generation capacity and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to minimise the impact of building emissions on local air quality in the interests of health, in accordance with policies SI1, S2 and SI3 of the London Plan 2021, policies 1.1(e), 1.1(j), 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of Ealing's adopted Development (or Core) Strategy 2012, policies LV5.2 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013, and the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG. | Following the end of the use of the Ground Source Heat Pump, the Ground Source Heat Pump and associated infrastructure shall be removed from the site:",

Any plants which die or are removed within the first five years following the implementation of the landscaping scheme shall be replaced during the next planting season.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development is landscaped in the interests of the visual character and appearance of the Conservation Area, to ensure appropriately landscaped amenity space and public realm, in accordance with policies D4, D8 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
