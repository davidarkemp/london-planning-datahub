    "The proposed development by reason of its design, scale and size would detract from the appearance of the property and pattern of development, harming its visual amenity. As such the proposed development would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy 7.4 Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing's Interim SPD 4 - Household Extensions. | The proposed development, by virtue of its siting and the location of the proposed windows to the first floor and second floor side elevation would give rise to direct overlooking to number 183 Wadham Gardens and beyond. The use of the communal garden by the proposed occupiers would lead to a significantly harmful increase in overlooking and loss of privacy to the future occupiers of both the HMO and self-contained 1 bedroom unit. The proposed conversion to large HMOs, by reason of the combined number of beds and occupants, would result in the over-intensification of the residential use of the host properties.  The resultant effect would be an unacceptable level of nuisance noise and disturbance by way of an increase number of people movements in and out of the property, to the detriment of the future occupiers and neighbouring residential amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development, by reason of its internal layout, would result in an overdevelopment of the host property that would provide a substandard quality and quantity of internal amenity space to the detriment of the quality of accommodation and living conditions for future occupants. Insufficient head height for the HMO, (only 26.8% of the property would meet the requirement of 2.5m floor to ceiling heigh). The lack of usable amenity space (associated with the new dwelling) would cause harm to the living conditions of this property. Given that the garden could be shared with the adjacent HMO, there could also be an unacceptable increase in overlooking/ loss of privacy of the proposed ground windows.The development is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Housing SPG 2016, Technical Housing Standards 2015, Ealing's development (Core) Strategy 2026, policy 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), and policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
