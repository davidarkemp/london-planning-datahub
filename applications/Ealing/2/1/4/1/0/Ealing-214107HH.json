    "The proposed first floor extension, by virtue of its siting, design and relationship with its context would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. An extension in this location and of this design would unduly draw the eye and would be a harmful and incongruous feature within the surrounding area. The overall scope of the proposed changes when taken as a whole would also constitute an overdevelopment of the plot. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
