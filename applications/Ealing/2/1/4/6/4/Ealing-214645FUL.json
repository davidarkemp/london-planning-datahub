If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall be mitigated as necessary to achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, namely, kitchen/living/dining/bathroom above/below/adjoining bedroom of separate dwelling.

The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
