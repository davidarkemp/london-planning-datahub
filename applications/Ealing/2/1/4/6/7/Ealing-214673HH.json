    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the drawings: 100 Rev P1; 101 Rev. P1; 102 Rev. P1; 103 Rev. P1; 201 Rev. P3; 202 Rev. P3; 203 Rev. P3; 204 Rev P1.",
    "Reason: For avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | Notwithstanding the details shown on the plans, all external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the existing building and surrounding area in accordance with policy D4 of The London Plan (2021), 1.1 and 1.2 of the Local Development Framework (Core) Strategy (2012); and 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used for domestic purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the main dwellinghouse at 131 Cleveland Road, West Ealing, London. W13 0EN, only and not for any other use. No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed into the outbuilding at any time.",
    "Reason: To prevent the creation of a separate self-contained residential unit of accommodation in the interests of the living conditions of the existing and future residents of the site and to ensure that the use of the building does not, by reason of any other activity, harm the living conditions in the area, in accordance with policies 1.1,1.2 & 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), SPG 4, and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
