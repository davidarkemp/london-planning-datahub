    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its siting, size and scale constitutes an over dominant and obtrusive form of development which would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and harm the visual amenities of surrounding occupants. As such the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), National Planning Policy Framework 2021 - Section 12 - Achieving well-designed places, Supplementary Planning Document 4 - Residential Extensions. | The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive cumulative site coverage and reduced rear garden space, would constitute a cramped overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character of the area and living conditions of occupants of the dwelling. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policies 7B, LV7.4 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and SPD4- Residential Extensions."
