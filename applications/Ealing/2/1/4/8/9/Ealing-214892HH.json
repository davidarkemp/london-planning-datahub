    "The combination of the first floor rear infill extension; rear roof extension; single storey rear extension; installation of raised platform to rear of property; and basement excavation, by reason of their scale, bulk, width, design, materials and fenestration, appears a dominant and incongruous addition, causing detrimental harm to the character of the host dwelling and of the character of the area, and to the visual amenities of neighbouring users. As such, the extension is contrary to polices D3, D4, D6, D10 of the London Plan (2021) and policies, 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
