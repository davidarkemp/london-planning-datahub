    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title numbers: DWG001 Existing Plans; DWG002 Existing Elevations; DWG003 Rev B Proposed Plans; DWG004 Rev B Proposed Elevations; Design, Access & Conservation Statement prepared by RHJB Architects dated July 2021.",
    "REASON: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless specified on the application form.",

    "REASON: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | No kitchen facilities shall be installed in the outbuilding at any time.",
    "REASON: To prevent the creation of a separate self-contained residential unit of accommodation in the interests of the living conditions of the existing and future residents of the site and to ensure that the use of the building does not, by reason of any other activity, harm the living conditions in the area, in accordance with policies 1.1,1.2 & 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
