    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings and documents: FLU.1589.01 Rev B (Location Plan), FLU.1589.02 (Existing Floor Plans), FLU.1589.03 (Existing Elevations), FLU.1589.04 (Existing Sections), FLU.1589.05 Rev D (Proposed Floor Plans), FLU.1589.06 Rev B (Proposed Elevations), FLU.1589.06 Rev C (Proposed Elevations), FLU.1589.07 (Access to Unit 3 Details), FLU.1589.08 (Site Plan), FLU.1589.09 (Bin and Cycle Store Floor Plan and Elevations), Report in Respect of Demand for Commercial Space prepared by John Vokins MRICS (dated 28 June 2019), Statement of Significance & Heritage Impact Assessment prepared by Asset Heritage Consulting (AHC REF: ND/9699 dated July 2021), and Design, Transport & Access Statement prepared by Process Planning (dated August 2021, Revision 2).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Notwithstanding the details shown on the plans, all external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The cycle and refuse storage areas identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 shall be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the hereby approved flats and shall be permanently retained for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate cycle and refuse facilities for future occupiers in accordance with policies SI 8 and T5 of the London Plan (2021) and SPG4. | Prior to commencement of the development, a noise assessment of external noise levels from transport and industrial/ commercial/ cultural sources, having regard to the assessment standards of the Council's SPG10 including aircraft noise (worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57/60 dB) shall be submitted to, and approved by, the Council in writing. Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10. The approved details shall be implemented prior to the first occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the units in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of the London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to commencement of the development, details of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, namely, kitchen/living/dining/bathroom and communal/public areas, shall be submitted to, and approved by, the Council in writing. The assessment and mitigation measures shall have regard to standards of the Council's SPG10 and noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to the first occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Ealing SPG10. | All restoration works hereby approved to both the interior and exterior of the building, as identified in the approved drawings and documents listed under condition 2, shall be completed in full prior to the first occupation of the hereby approved residential units.",
    "Reason: To ensure the public benefits of the development are secured in a timely manner and outweigh the 'less than substantial harm' to the listed building, in accordance with paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2021). | Prior to the commencement of the hereby approved development, details of the restored windows and doors, including doors installed within window openings, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application. The details shall include 1:20 cross sectional drawings, materials, transoms, glazing, fixings and ironmongery. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development would preserve the special character and appearance of the Grade II Listed Building, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3, D4 and HC 1of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The cast iron staircases to the east and west elevations shall be used for the sole purpose of fire exits from the first floor and shall not be used as a means of access or as amenity areas at any time.",
    "Reason: In the interests of protecting the amenity of future residents in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
