    "The proposed development by reason of design, scale, bulk, massing, siting and roof forms would constitute an intrusive, incongruous and prominent feature and result in a form of overdevelopment of the subject site which would adversely affect the character of the original dwellinghouse as well as the character of the area and the visual amenity of the conservation area. As such the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and Brunswick Conservation Area Management Plan and Appraisal (2007). | The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its height, depth and location would result in an imposing and overbearing development that would lead to an increased sense of enclosure and loss of light into the adjoining property at no. 49 Lynwood Road, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021); and 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
