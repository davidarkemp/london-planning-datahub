    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Other than the balconies identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2, no part of the roof shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",

Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10. Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. The approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Ealing SPG10. | Prior to commencement of the hereby approved development, details of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings, namely, kitchen/living dining/bathroom above/below bedrooms of separate dwelling, shall be submitted to and approved by the Council in writing. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards of the Council's SPG10 and the criteria of BS8233:2014.
