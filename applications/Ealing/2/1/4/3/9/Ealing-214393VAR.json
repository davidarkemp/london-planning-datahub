    "The proposed amendments cannot be accepted as a minor material amendments to planning permission Ref: 178784FUL, amended by reference 185616VAR dated 11/10/2019, in accordance with Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for 'Minor material Amendments following grant of planning permission', on the following grounds: the proposed 2 studio flats would fail to provide adequate living conditions as north facing, single aspect dwellings resulting in non-compliant daylight and sunlight standards, as well as issues relating to noise, air quality, ventilation and overheating. The proposed flats would have a lack of privacy amenity space provision and subsequent barriers from adjacent communal amenity space, resulting in a materially detrimental impact on both the amenity of future resident and neighbouring users. As such, the proposal is contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D4 and D6, Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) 7B, the Technical Housing Standards, the Mayor's Housing SPG and Ealing's Protocol for Minor Material Amendments following grant of planning permission (2015)."
