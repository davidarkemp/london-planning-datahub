    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building and shall be consistent with those as listed within the submitted application form and the drawings / plans as listed in Condition (2).",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4, 7A and 7B, policies 1.1 (h), 1.2 (g) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The maximum number of persons occupying the house in multiple occupation hereby approved shall be limited to no more than 10 people in 6 bedrooms .",
    "Reason: To protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of the future occupants of the development in accordance with policies with policies 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013), policy 1.1 (e) of the Ealing Development Strategy 2026 (2012) and policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021). | No cooking facilities shall be installed at any time in any of the rooms. All cooking and preparation of hot food shall take place within the communal kitchen on the ground floor.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the HMO rooms are not wholly self-contained and to protect the amenity of the occupants of each of the rooms and neighbouring properties, in accordance with Policy D6 of the London Plan, Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Council HMO Licensing Guidelines. | The proposed cycle parking structure in the front garden shown on the approved plans shall be implemented in full prior to occupation of the property and retained thereafter.",

    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, to protect amenity of the area and in the interests of the future occupants of the development in accordance with policies with policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan 2013, policy 1.1(e) of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan (2021). | The planters to the front forecourt shall be provided, prior to occupation of the building and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.",

The sound insulation of the building envelope shall achieve the internal criteria for sensitive rooms, as specified in Supplementary Planning Guidance 10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building).  The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 and D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses, namely, communal main entrance and bathrooms adjoining bedrooms. The assessment and mitigation measures shall have regard to standards of the Council's SPG10 and noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2021), Standard 30 of the Housing SPG and Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021). | The window/s inserted in the side elevations shall be obscure glazed and non-opening (where openable parts less than 1.7m above floor) unless otherwise confirmed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
