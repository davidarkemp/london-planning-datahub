    "There is a lack of information on the submitted plans with regards missing elevations as well as the levels within the site. Number 12 Lucy Crescent has also been separated into flats but the current application states that the rear garden would be associated 12 Lucy Crescent. It does not reference the ground or first floor flat or how the rear garden is separated. It is therefore not possible to accurately confirm the impact the proposed development would have upon the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. It is also not possible to accurately ascertain the impact the proposed development would have upon the living conditions of the adjacent occupiers. The development is therefore considered contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposed residential development, by virtue of its backland location and separation of the plot as well as excessive footprint, scale, bulk and form of the building would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. It would also significantly disrupt the spatial characteristics of the area and be to the detriment of visual amenity. It would therefore be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposal is located adjacent a number of trees, some of which are outside of the site and no tree survey has been submitted with the application. The development would also be located in close proximity to and would impact upon a green corridor which is located to the rear of the site. The proposed development would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area and would be contrary to Policy 5.10 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development, by virtue of the access to the side of number 12 Lucy Crescent would give rise to a harmful increase in overlooking/ loss of privacy to this neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed internal layout would cause harm to the living conditions of the future occupier. Light and outlook to the single person bedroom would be inhibited by the adjacent fence and the kitchen would also only receive light and outlook through a rooflight. This would therefore cause harm and would be contrary to policies  7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
