    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title numbers: SO-934-01, SO-934-02, SO-934-03, SO-934-04, SO-934-05, SO-934-06, SO-934-07.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Details of the materials and finishes to be used for all external surfaces (including hardstanding and boundary treatments) of the development hereby approved shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority before the superstructure of the development is commenced and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application. The development shall be implemented only in accordance with these approved details.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials and finishes are of high quality and contribute positively to the visual amenity of the locality in accordance with policies 1.1 (h) (g), 1.2(h), 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies ELV 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | Notwithstanding the provisions of Classes A - F of Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (or any subsequent amendment to that order) no extensions or alterations shall be carried out at the dwellinghouse hereby approved without the prior permission of the local planning authority obtained through the submission of a planning application.",
    "Reason: To prevent the overdevelopment of the site, to safeguard the living conditions of adjoining properties and visual appearance of the area, and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The refuse storage area shown on the approved plans shall be provided prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained unobstructed in perpetuity. Refuse and recycling shall be deposited kerbside for collection and returned to the storage area in accordance with Council policies.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate disposal, storage and collection of waste and recycling, to protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of highway and pedestrian safety all in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) and 6.1 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy SI 7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The cycle storage shown on approved plans shall provide a minimum of 2 cycle parking spaces in accordance with policy and these shall be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate facilities for cyclists, in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The amenity area shown on the approved plans shall be laid out prior to first occupation of any of the dwelling hereby permitted and retained in perpetuity thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that there is adequate provision of amenity space within the site in accordance with Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57dB). The sound insulation of the building envelope, with windows shut and other means of ventilation provided, shall achieve the internal criteria for sensitive rooms, as specified in Supplementary Planning Guidance 10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building).  The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the internal environment of the development and living conditions of future occupiers of the site and occupiers of nearby properties, in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'. | Control measures during demolition and construction shall ensure that the following standards are implemented:",

    "- dust (according to Supplementary Planning Guidance by the GLA (2014) for The Control of Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition),",
    "- lighting ('Guidance Note 01/20 For the Reduction of Obtrusive Light' by the Institution of Lighting Professionals),",
    "- hours of work and all associated activities audible beyond the site boundary restricted to 0800-1800hrs Mondays to Fridays, 0800 -1300 Saturdays,",
    "- notifications of works to interested parties and regular neighbour liaison,",
    "- public display of contact details including accessible phone numbers for persons responsible for the site works for the duration of the works.",
