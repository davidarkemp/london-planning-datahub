  "description": "Formation of vehicle crossover",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed crossover, by reason of its excessive width, depth, proximity to adjacent street tree and telecoms cabinet, and inability to enter and exit the forecourt in a forward gear would result in harm to the visual amenity and character of the area, as well as adversely affect the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and other footway and highway users. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to the Council's Vehicle Crossovers: Application Pack for Residents (2016), Policies D8, G7, T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of Ealing's Development Management DPD."
