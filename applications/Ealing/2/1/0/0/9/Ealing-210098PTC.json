  "description": "Apple Tree (as indicated in the photos and on the sketch plan) - Fell because of excessive shading, poor quality fruit which cannot be used for eating/cooking (and which falls in both my garden and the neighbour's garden at number 5 giving rise to a nuisance due to large quantities of rotting apples on their lawn) and low amenity value. The apple tree has been planted into the middle of the garden area which reduces the amenity of the garden space.  Proposed to replant the area with lower level architectural shrubbery and flowers.",
