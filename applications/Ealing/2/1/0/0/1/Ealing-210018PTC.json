Trees are also situated on clay and due to the size of the trees there is a clear issue with subsidence, the trees are also asymmetrical and are heavily shading the garden restricting growth of grass and other plants whilst littering the ground with leaves and causing moss and algae build up on the building and garden, the trees overall structural condition and vigor is poor, the trees have clearly outgrown the location. \n\nReplanting of 18-20cm X2 Swamp Cypress and X2 Amelanchier ? grandiflora 'Ballerina' 12-14 cm, X1 Acer Griseum",
