    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing numbers: A0001 Rev B, A1001 Rev C, A1002 Rev C, A1003 Rev C, A1004 Rev C, A2001 Rev C, A2002 Rev C, A3001 Rev C, A3002 Rev C, A3003 Rev C, A3004 Rev C.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B, London Plan (2021) policy D3 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | No part of the roof of the rear extension shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",
    "Reason: To protect residential amenity, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 2.1 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | Provision for cycle storage as shown on the approved plans and in accordance with adopted standards shall be provided prior to occupation and be continuously available and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate bicycle storage provision and in the interests of reducing congestion to the local transport network, in accordance with policies 1.1 (j) and 3.1(i) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | As the site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57dB) the sound insulation of the building envelope, with windows shut and other means of ventilation provided, shall achieve the internal criteria for sensitive rooms, as specified in Supplementary Planning Guidance 10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building). The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, namely, kitchen/living/dining/bathroom above/below/adjoining bedroom of separate dwelling. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards of the Council's SPG10 and the criteria of BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'."
