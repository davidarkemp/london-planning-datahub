Details shall demonstrate suitable orientation of habitable rooms away from major noise sources and include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal room standards of SPG10 and noise limits specified by BS8233:2014. Details of best practicable mitigation measures to achieve these criteria also in external amenity shall be submitted.  A post completion sound assessment shall be carried out where required to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and details, including any mitigation measures, be submitted for the Council's approval before the premises are occupied. The approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
