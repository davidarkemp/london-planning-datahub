    "| Transport and/or commercial/industrial/cultural noise sources",
    "The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications and protection of external amenity spaces shall be based on the noise assessment standards specified in SPG10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall conform with standards of the Council's SPG10 and noise limits specified in BS8233:2014 and be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards of the Council's SPG10 and the criteria of BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

    "The sound insulation value of the separating structures between the commercial parts of the building and the dwelling shall be enhanced by at least 10-15dB above the Building Regulations value for residential use and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures shall be implemented to prevent ingress of commercial sounds to the dwelling. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards of the Council's SPG10 and the criteria of BS8233:2014. All mitigation measures shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be retained throughout its use.",
