    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title(s) T10_P100 rev P1 (Site Location Plan); T10_P200 rev P1 (Existing Site Plan); T10_P300 rev P2 received 06/04/2021 (Proposed Site Plan); T10_P01 rev P4 received 06/04/2021 (Proposed Floor Plan and Elevations); T10_P02 rev P2 received 06/04/2021 (Proposed and Existing Elevation and Section)",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | The maximum number of persons occupying the house in multiple occupation hereby approved shall be limited to no more than 13 people in 8 rooms.",

All cooking and preparation of hot food shall take place within the communal kitchens on the ground and first floors.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the HMO rooms are not wholly self-contained and to protect the amenity of the occupants of each of the rooms and neighbouring properties, in accordance with Policy D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Council HMO Licensing Guidelines. | The proposed cycle parking in the front garden, as shown on the approved plans, shall be implemented in full prior to occupation of the property and retained thereafter. The cycle parking proposed must be secure and covered.",
    "Reason: To promote more sustainable forms of transportation, in accordance with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | Notwithstanding the approved plans, refuse/recycling storage shall be provided in accordance with Council policies and brought into use prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained thereafter.",

    "Reason: To minimise light spillage and interference with the privacy and outlook of adjoining occupiers and in the interests of good neighbourliness and in accordance with policies 7.4 an 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications and external amenity areas shall be in accordance with the Council's assessment standards of the SPG10 and achieve compliance with the acoustic noise limits specified in BS8233:2014.  If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise).  The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",

Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
