  "description": "Request for a Screening Opinion under Regulation 6 of the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations (2017) for the redevelopment of the site comprising approximately 100 dwellings (Use Class C3), arranged across 3 blocks ranging from 2/3 storeys up to 5/6 storeys; approximately 25 car parking spaces accessed at ground floor level from Rushdene Crescent; private amenity space in the form of a balconies and gardens; approximately 715 sqm of children play space at podium level;  public open space / park of approximately 2,530 sqm in place of the existing MUGA; and other proposed landscaping, including a healthy street, providing a connection to the proposed public open space (following demolition of existing school and community centre buildings) - Application by the London Borough of Ealing.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development falls outside of the definition of 'Schedule 2 Development' as this 'Urban Development Project' proposes less than 150 dwellings and is not located within a 'sensitive area' defined within the EIA Regulations (as amended). | The proposed development has been 'screened', having regard to the selection criteria for screening Schedule 2 development set out in 'Schedule 3'; namely having regard to (i) the characteristics of development; (ii) the location of development, and (iii) the characteristics of the potential impact. | On this basis the Local Planning Authority is of the opinion that the proposed development will not likely have significant effects on the environment as interpreted by the EIA Regulations (as amended). Therefore, the proposal does not constitute EIA development requiring an Environmental Statement. This is not to say that the proposed development will not have environmental effects of a localised nature which will need to be considered in determining any planning application."
