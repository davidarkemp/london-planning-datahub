  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, design and relationship with its context would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. The proposed design and hipped and crown roof would also unduly draw the eye and would be a harmful and incongruous feature within the street scene. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proposed single storey rear extensions due to the siting, depth and height would likely to result in undue loss of outlook to a habitable room window to the rear of number 67 Rushdene Crescent. It would also enclose the patio area of this property and would adversely affect the residential amenity of this occupier contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D6 and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
