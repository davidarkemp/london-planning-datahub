  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed side/rear and roof extensions, by reason of their bulk, scale, depth, design, height and loss of sloped roof profile to the outrigger, would constitute an incongruous form of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the host dwelling. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and SPD4 (Residential Extensions). | The proposed side/rear and roof extensions, by reason of their depth, loss of setback and bulk created in an elevated position, would result in an overbearing form of development, that would be likely to create an increased sense of enclosure and perceived loss of privacy to the occupants of no. 25 Saville Road. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
