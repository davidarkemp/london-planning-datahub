    "5 \tNo advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.",
    "6 \tNo advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of, any road traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or so as otherwise to render hazardous the use of any highway, waterway (including any coastal waters) or aerodrome (civil or military).",
    "Note: These are imposed automatically unless expressly varied, for instance the time limit shortened.",
