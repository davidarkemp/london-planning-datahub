Details shall be provided of a reasonable distance of the extract outlet approximately 20.0meters from any openable window, of equipment and ducting to be fitted with anti-vibration mounts and silencers and of additional mitigation measures as necessary to ensure that noise and vibration transmission via internal ceilings, walls and external fa√ßades will meet the Council's standards specified in the SPG10. Approved details shall be implemented prior to use and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of residential occupiers within the building or adjacent, in accordance with Interim Supplementary Planning Guidance 10, policies 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of the external rating noise level emitted from plant/machinery/equipment/ducting/air in- and outlets/mechanical installations, together with mitigation measures as appropriate. The measures shall ensure that the external rating noise level LAeq emitted will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity. A post installation sound assessment shall be carried out where required to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and additional steps to mitigate noise shall be taken, as necessary.
