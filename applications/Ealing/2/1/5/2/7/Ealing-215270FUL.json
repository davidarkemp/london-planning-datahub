The energy proposal shall demonstrate the use of the Best Available Technology for minimising carbon emissions at the time of construction of the development. Renewable energy such as heat pumps and photovoltaics should be used if technically feasible, and if not then where boilers are proposed, details should demonstrate that they would not worsen existing air quality for occupants and neighbouring residents and that its N0x output would be under 0.030 g/kWh.  The plant shall be installed in accordance with the approved details.",
