    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All materials to be used in the development shall be in accordance with the hereby approved plans listed in Condition 2 above.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7B of Adopted Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013), polices 1.1 (k) and 1.2 (f) of the adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | Prior to commencement of the development hereby approved, a Demolition Method Statement and Construction Management Plan shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing. Control measures shall ensure that the following standards are implemented:",
    "o Noise and vibration (according to Approved CoP BS 5228-1 and - 2:2009+A1:2014);",
    "o Dust (according to Supplementary Planning Guidance by the GLA (2014) for The Control of Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition);",
    "o Lighting ('Guidance Note 01/20 For The Reduction Of Obtrusive Light' by the Institution of Lighting Professionals);",
    "o Anticipated number, frequency and size of construction vehicles entering/exiting the site;",
    "o Delivery times and booking system (staggered to avoid morning and afternoon peak periods);",
    "o Site access for construction traffic and contractor staff parking and associated signage;",
    "o Secure, off-street loading and drop-off facilities;",
    "o Locations for the storage of building materials and construction debris and contractors' offices;",
    "o Hours of work and all associated activities audible beyond the site boundary restricted to 0800-1800hrs Mondays to Fridays, 0800-1300 Saturdays;",
    "o Notifications of works to interested parties and regular neighbour liaison;",
    "o Public display of contact details including accessible phone numbers for persons responsible for the site works for the duration of the works.",
    "The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the approved plan for the duration of the works.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of surrounding premises are not adversely affected by noise, vibration, dust, lighting or other emissions from the site, and to ensure appropriate mitigation measures to ensure adequate highway and site safety in accordance with Policies 1.1 (g), (h) and (f) of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policy D14, SI1 and T4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies Ealing Local Variation of London Plan Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be based on the noise assessment standards specified in the Council's SPG10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room and external amenity noise levels shall conform with standards of the Council's SPG10 and criteria of BS8233:2014. A post installation sound assessment shall be carried out to confirm compliance with the noise criteria. Details of the post installation test shall be submitted for the Council's approval before the premises are occupied and additional steps shall be taken as necessary to minimise noise intrusion and comply with the criteria. Details of best practicable mitigation measures shall also be submitted for external amenity spaces (where provided) and demonstrate that these criteria are achieved. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 and D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The sound insulation of the floor/ceiling /wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses, namely, kitchen and bathroom adjoining bedroom of separate dwelling, should be enhanced by at least 5dB above the recommended Building Regulations value. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards of the Council's SPG10 and the criteria of BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site are not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Standard 30 of the Housing SPG and Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021). | A minimum of eight (8) secured cycle parking spaces shall be provided on site as shown on hereby approved plans and in accordance with the adopted standards of the London Plan (2021). Such provision shall be brought into use prior to first occupation and retained permanently.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate facilities for cyclists and increase the use of active and sustainable modes of transport, in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | Refuse and recycling storage shall be provided, as per hereby approved drawing number 722 A_200 C, in line with British Standards and shall comprise bins for waste separation into non-recyclable, recyclable and food waste and shall be retained for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To protect the living conditions of occupants of nearby properties and future occupiers of the development, in accordance with policies 7A and 74 of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and policies SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan (2021)."
