    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings and documents: 1816/63FL-01/SP (Existing Ground Floor Plan), 1816/63FL-02/SP (Existing First Floor & Loft Plan), 1816/63FL-03/SP REV A (Existing Elevations), 1816/41FL-04/SP (Proposed Ground Floor Plan), 1816/63FL-05/SP (Proposed First Floor & Loft Plans), 1816/63FL-06/SP (Proposed Elevations), 1816/63FL-07/SP (Proposed Section), 1816/63FL-08/SP REV A (Proposed Site Plan), 1816/63FL-09/SP (Location Plan, Block Plan), 1816/63-3F-09/SP Bin Storage Details, DWG1 Bicycle Storage Details.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings listed under condition 2.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | No part of the roof of the building shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",
    "Reason: To protect the living conditions of nearby properties in accordance with policies D4 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), polices 7.4, 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013) and polices 1.1 (e)(g), 1.2 (f), 2.1(c) and 2.10 the Ealing Core Strategy (2012). | The cycle and refuse storage areas identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 shall be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the hereby approved flats and shall be permanently retained for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate cycle and refuse facilities for future occupiers in accordance with policies SI 8 and T5 of the London Plan (2021) and SPG4. | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, eg. kitchen/living/dining/bathroom above/below bedroom of separate dwellings. The assessment and mitigation measures shall have regard to standards of the Council's SPG10 and noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site premises is not adversely affected by noise and vibration in the interests of general living amenities, in accordance with policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPG10. | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed and implemented with regard to the Council's standard in the SPG10 and noise limits of BS8233:201. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve criteria specified in BS8233:2014. The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPG10. | The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPG10. | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPG10. | Prior to the commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority, for the installation in the dwellings of a filtered fresh air ventilation system capable of mitigating elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in the external air. The details to be submitted shall include the arrangements for continuously maintaining the operational efficiency of the system.  The ventilation system as approved shall be completed prior to occupation and shall be retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the amenity of occupiers of the development site are not adversely impacted by poor air quality in accordance with policies D6 and SI1 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
