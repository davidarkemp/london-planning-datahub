    "The proposed terrace to the rear would give rise to direct overlooking of the neighbouring properties and beyond. As such, the proposal is contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | The lack of a flue/ means of extraction associated with the proposed development would cause harm. This would be required for a restaurant and without these details, it is not possible to adequately assess the impact upon the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area or the impact upon the living conditions of the adjacent occupiers. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The siting of the access to the rear would cause harm to the living conditions of the future occupier. They would need to walk down a narrow and ungated footpath to access the site. This could cause issue in terms of items such as security. The proposal is contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
