  "description": "Construction of new dormer roof to rear with new external roof terrace to flat roof.\n\nThis application is very similar to the current approval (204377FUL) for the property. The only change is to extend the dormer roof into an existing raised party wall which forms the side of a dormer to number 21A. This change is required to improve the buildability of the proposed dormer and assist with weathering which will be difficult to achieve in the narrow gap created between the extended party wall and dormer design on the current approval. Please refer to the included photo which shows the raised party wall and next doors dormer.",
