    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "| The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawings titled: LOCATION PLAN, SCP2210703- 01 EXISTING & PROPOSED BLOCK PLANS, SCP2210703-1 PROPOSED OUTBUILDING PLANS",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building and shall be consistent with those listed within the submitted application form and the drawings / plans as listed in Condition (2).",
    "REASON: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 7.4 & 7B of the Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 1.1 (g), 2.1 (c) and 2.10 of the Adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "| Existing trees adjacent/close to the boundaries of the site shall not be lopped, felled or otherwise affected in any way (including raising or lowering soil levels under the crown spread of the trees) and no excavation shall be cut under the crown spread of the trees. Protection of the trees, hedgerows and groups of mature shrubs off site that are adjacent/close to it shall be carried out only in accordance with British Standard 5837:2005 'Trees In Relation To Construction Recommendations' (or any subsequent revision), and shall be maintained fully intact and (in the case of the fencing) at all times, until the completion of all building operations on the site.",
    "Reason:  To ensure appropriate tree protection in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies G5 and G7 of the London Plan, policy 5.10 of Ealing's Development Management DPD and Ealing's SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines.",
    "| The outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used for domestic purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the main dwellinghouse at no. 7 Lile Crescent, Hanwell, London, W7 1AH, and not for any separate residential, industrial, commercial or business use. No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed into the outbuilding at any time.",
    "REASON: To prevent the creation of a separate self-contained residential unit of accommodation in the interests of the living conditions of the existing and future residents of the site and to ensure that the building does not, by reason of any other activity, harm the living conditions in the area, in accordance with policies 1.1, 1.2, and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), SPG 4, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
