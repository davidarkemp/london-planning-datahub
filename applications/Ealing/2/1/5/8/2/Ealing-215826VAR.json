Details shall be provided of a reasonable distance of the extract outlet approximately 20.0meters from any openable window, of equipment and ducting to be fitted with anti-vibration mounts and silencers and of additional mitigation measures as necessary to ensure that noise and vibration transmission via internal ceilings, walls and external façades will meet the Council's standards specified in the SPG10. Approved details shall be implemented prior to use and thereafter be permanently retained.",
