    "The proposed first floor side extension would project forward of the adjacent neighbouring first floor habitable room window at no. 41 Craneswater Road, thereby affecting outlook from this window and creating a sense of enclosure detrimental to the amenity of neighbouring occupants. As such, the proposal is considered poor design contrary policies 7A, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013);  London Plan(2021) policies D3 and D4 and Ealing's Supplementary Planning Document 4 (SPD4). | The cumulative appearance of the raised ridgeline to the main roof, absence of subservience for the two storey side extension and the hipped side dormer window would generate an unsympathetic and discordant set of roof extensions which excessively increase the bulk of the roof to the extent that it fails to be complementary in design to the original house.  As such the proposal does not adequately respect the character of the existing building, or the surrounding street scene and would be contrary to policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), London Plan(2021) policies D3 and D4, SPD4 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
