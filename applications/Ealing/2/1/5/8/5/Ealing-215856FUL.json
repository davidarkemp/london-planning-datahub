    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings: L.01 (Site Plan), TP.01 Rev B (Existing First Floor), TP.02 Rev B (Proposed First Floor), Design and Access Statement prepared by UCKG Help Centre dated September 2021 (ref: E-14.1 Rev A), Noise Breakout Assessment prepared by Anderson Acoustics dated November 2021 (ref: 5483_001R_2-0_BP Version 2.0), Noise Control prepared by UCKG Help Centre dated September 2021 (ref: E-14.1), Opening Hours prepared by UCKG Help Centre dated September 2021 (ref: E-14.1) and Travel Statement prepared by UCKG Help Centre dated September 2021 (ref: E-14.1 Rev A).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | The staff accommodation hereby approved shall be used only for purposes ancillary to the main use of the site as a place of worship, and shall not be used as separate residential accommodation, letting or any commercial use at any time.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The noise mitigation measures recommended in the Noise Breakout Assessment prepared by Anderson Acoustics (as referenced in the approved drawings and documents listed under condition 2) shall be implemented in full prior to the first use of the hereby approved development and shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site and nearby residential sites is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Ealing SPG10. | Prior to the first use of the hereby approved development, external doors to the premises shall be fitted with self-closing devices. The self-closing devices shall be maintained in an operational condition for the lifetime of the development and at no time shall any external door or window to rooms where noise may be emitted be fixed in an open position.",

If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise).",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site and nearby residential sites is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Ealing SPG10. | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site and nearby residential sites is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Ealing SPG10. | The premises shall not be open to the public outside of the hours of 06:30 to 22:30 Mondays to Sundays and Public/Bank Holidays.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from activities or people attending the site, in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The development shall not be used for any purpose other than as a place of worship (Use Class F1(f)) at any time without having first obtained the written consent of the LPA via the submission of a planning application.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the Council retains control over the quality and provision of any change of use, and to protect the character of the area and the amenity of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policies D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7A, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
