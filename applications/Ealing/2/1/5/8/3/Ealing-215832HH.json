    "The proposed development , by reason of its prominence, design, siting, height, scale and proximity to shared boundaries, would not be consistent with the prevailing pattern of development, would constitute an incongruous and insubordinate form of development, would result in harm to the symmetry with 24 Spencer Road, and would result in a sense of enclosure and harm to the visual amenities of no. 124 Shakespeare Road, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the enjoyment of neighbouring residential gardens. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and SPD4 (Residential Extensions)."
