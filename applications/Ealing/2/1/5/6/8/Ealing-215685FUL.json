    "The proposed development by reason of its design, scale and size would detract from the appearance of the property and pattern of development, harming its visual amenity. As such the proposed development would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policy 7.4 Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing's Interim SPD 4 - Household Extensions. | The proposed development by reason of car parking outside of the windows of the ground floor flat windows, side facing windows serving bedrooms and the extension interfering with the 45-degree line of outlook would lead to harm regarding outlook, sense of enclosure and noise and disturbance, contrary to policy D6 and Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021), Housing SPG 2016, Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard March 2015, Ealing's development (Core) Strategy 2026 and Ealing local variation to London Plan policy 3.5 of the Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed enlarged crossover, by reason of its design and size would compromise pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 6.3 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Supplementary Planning Document 8 - Crossovers and Parking in Front Gardens. | The proposed location of the cycle stores, by reason of their lack of accessibility within the rear garden, would fail to promote sustainable travel within the borough, contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan (2021)."
