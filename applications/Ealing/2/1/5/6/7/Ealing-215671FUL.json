    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | Notwithstanding the details shown on the plans, all external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing dwelling at no. 55 Alleyn Park.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 or any Order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification, no extension, enlargement or other alteration of the new dwellinghouse other than that expressly authorised by this permission shall be carried out without planning permission first obtained from the local planning authority.",
    "Reason: The local planning authority considers that further development could cause detriment to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby properties or to the character of the area and for this reason would wish to control any future development to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | Notwithstanding the approved plans, refuse/recycling storage shall be provided in accordance with Council policies prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained thereafter.",

    "| All Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) of net power of 37kW and up to and including 560kW used during the course of the demolition, site preparation and construction phases shall comply with the emission standards set out in chapter 7 of the GLA's supplementary planning guidance \"Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition\" dated July 2014 (SPG), or subsequent guidance. Unless it complies with the standards set out in the SPG, no NRMM shall be on site, at any time, whether in use or not, without the prior written consent of the local planning authority. The developer shall keep an up to date list of all NRMM used during the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development on the online register at https://nrmm.london/.",

    "o An intrusive contaminated land investigation and risk assessment of the site (as deemed appropriate based on a Phase 1 desk study and conceptual site model (CSM)  shall be carried out in accordance with BS1075:2011+A1:2013 and LCRM (formerly CLR11) guidance to assess the nature and extent of any contamination on the site. This assessment must be undertaken by a competent person, and shall assess any contamination on the site, whether or not it originates on the site.",
    "o A contamination remediation scheme to bring the site to a condition suitable for the intended end use. It shall include all works to be undertaken, proposed remediation objectives and remediation criteria, timetable of works and site management procedures. The scheme must ensure that the site will not qualify as contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to the intended use of the land after remediation.",
    "Reason: To protect the health and living conditions of residents in accordance with policy 1.1 (j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), and policy 5.21 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013).",
    "| Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme, a verification report that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced, and is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority before occupation of the development. The verification report submitted shall be in accordance with the latest Environment Agency guidance and industry best practice.",
    "Reason: To ensure the land contamination issues are addressed in accordance with policy1.1 (j) of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and Ealing Local Variation to London Plan Policy 5.21 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013.",
    "| Prior to commencement of the development, a noise assessment shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of external noise levels from transport and industrial/ commercial/ cultural sources, having regard to the assessment standards of the Council's SPG10, including aircraft noise (worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57/60 dB) as per Section 6 SPG10). Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10. Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014.  The approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
