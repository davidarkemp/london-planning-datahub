    "The proposed demolition of an attached building is contrary to the provisions of Part 20 Class ZA ((b) and (b)(i)) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 3) Order 2020 that allows for demolition of any single detached building that is Class B1(c). | The proposed building by way of its design, siting and close proximity to commercial uses and their access and servicing area would present a conflict between different uses that would also prejudice the safety of pedestrian and vehicles on servicing areas, contrary to condition (a) of Part 20 Class ZA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 3) Order 2020. | 3The landscape aspects of the proposal, by way of excessive hard landscaping, insufficient planting, a poor planting mix, poor ecological value, insufficient details being provided on tree protection and poor amenity space provision, are not considered acceptable and therefore do not satisfy condition (k) of Part 20 Class ZA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 3) Order 2020. | The proposed building by way of its design, siting, scale and mass would result in undue harm to the visual amenity and character of the street scene and surrounding area. By way of its single aspect units, including a north facing single aspect unit, and poor-quality amenity spaces, it would also provide substandard amenity for future occupiers. As such, it is contrary to conditions (d), (e) and (g) (i) of Part 20 Class ZA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 3) Order 2020. | 5The proposed development would be directly adjacent to a main railway line, busy roads and industrial/commercial premises and no air quality assessment has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal is compliant with condition (g) of Part 20 Class ZA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (No. 3) Order 2020."
