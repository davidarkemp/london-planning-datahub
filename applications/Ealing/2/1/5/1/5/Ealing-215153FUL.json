    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.",
    "| The materials to be used for the external surfaces of the development shall be as set out on approved plan AL(05) 1150 REV 02 and the development shall be carried out only in accordance with these details and permanently retained as such thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and 7.4 and 7b of the Ealing Development Management DPD.",
    "| The first floor windows on both flank walls shall be obscure glazing and shall be non-open unless the height is higher than 1.7m taken from internal finished floor level.  These windows shall thereafter be permanently retained in this condition.",
    "Reason:  To protect residential amenity, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

    "Reason: To prevent the overdevelopment of the site and to safeguard the living conditions of occupiers of adjoining properties and the appearance of the streetscene, in accordance with policies 1.1 (g) and (h) of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy, policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan.",

    "The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed with regard to the Council's standard in the SPG10 and noise limits of BS8233:2014. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve criteria specified in BS8233:2014. The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",

These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",
    "Reason:  To protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of the future occupants of the development in accordance with policies with policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan 2013, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policy SI8 The London Plan (2021).",
