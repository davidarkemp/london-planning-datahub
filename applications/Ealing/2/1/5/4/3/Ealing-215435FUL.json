    "The retrospective development reduces industrial floor space capacity, which adversely affects the proper functioning of neighbouring industrial uses and undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the Strategic Industrial Location (SIL) and its ability to support and provide capacity for a variety of SIL-compliant uses, conflicting with the aims and objectives of policies E4 and E5 of the London Plan (2021), policy 1.1(c) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2026, and the Mayor's Land for Industry and Transport SPG (2012). | The retrospective development by reason of the increase in car parking provision and lack of cycle provision fails to meet the sustainable development objectives and fails to provide adequate sustainable transport of the local planning authority and would lead to an increase in traffic to the detriment of the Strategic Industrial Location and wider borough, contrary to Policies SI1, SI2, T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021). | The retrospective development, by reason of its opening hours, odour emissions, noise and disturbance that arises from the loud, amplified music being played at the property and coming and goings and congregation of customers in the early hours of the morning, has a detrimental impact on the amenity of residential and business occupiers in the locality of the area contrary to policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 1.1 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2026."
