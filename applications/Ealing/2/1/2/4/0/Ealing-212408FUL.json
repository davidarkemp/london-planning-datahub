    "c)\tPrior to the installation of the renewable/low-carbon energy equipment technical details of the equipment shall be submitted to the Council for approval. The details shall include the exact heat pump thermal kilowatt output, heat output pipe diameter(s), parasitic load supply schematics, monthly energy demand profile, and the exact kWp capacity of the PV array, and the orientation, pitch and mounting of the panels, and the make and model of the panels. The name and contact details of the LZC installation contractor(s), and if different, the commissioning electrical or plumbing contractor, should be submitted to the Council prior to installation.",
    "d)\tOn completion of the installation of the LZC equipment copies of the MCS certificates and all relevant commissioning documentation shall be submitted to the Council.",
    "e)\tAll boilers to serve the energy requirements of the development detailed in the approved energy strategy should be specified with NOx emissions (g/m²) that are compliant with or better than the ultra-low NOx (g/m²) benchmarks as set out at Appendix 5 of the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG.",
    "f)\tWithin three months of the occupation/first use of the development the relevant Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and detailed SAP Worksheets showing clearly the TER and DER, and/or the Display Energy Certificates (DEC's), accompanying Advisory Reports and detailed BRUKL modelling output reports showing clearly the TER and BER from the 'as built stage' following completion of the development, shall be submitted to, and approved by, the Local Authority in order to confirm compliance with the energy efficiency measures detailed in the approved Energy Strategy. The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason: In the interest of addressing climate change and to secure environmentally sustainable development in accordance with policies SI2 and SI3 of the London Plan (2021), and the relevant guidance notes in the GLA Energy Assessment Guidance 2020, policies LV5.2 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013, and policies 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2012.",
    "| Prior to completion of the approved development, the details of the dynamic thermal modelling for each dwelling, or an agreed percentage of the apartments, shall be undertaken using the guidance provided in the relevant CIBSE document and shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval demonstrating that the development performs against their overheating criteria and exceed the requirements to avoid overheating. The details of any additional measures to be incorporated into the development to minimise the risk of overheating (including active cooling) shall also be submitted if the dynamic thermal modelling demonstrates that overheating would occur. The development shall thereafter be provided in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the risk of overheating has been sufficiently addressed in accordance with policy 5.9 of the London Plan; Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy, and Development Management DPD.",
    "| In order to implement Ealing Council DPD policy 5.2.3 (post-construction energy equipment monitoring), and key parts of London Plan policy SI2 (\"be Seen\"), the developer shall:",

    "b)\tUpon final construction of the development, or relevant phases of the development, and prior to occupation, the agreed suitable devices for monitoring the performance/efficiency (COP) of any renewable/low-carbon energy equipment shall be installed. The monitored data shall be automatically submitted to the Council at daily intervals for a period of four years from occupation and full operation of the energy equipment. The installation of the monitoring devices and the submission and format of the data shall be carried out in accordance with the Council's approved specifications as indicated in the Automated Energy Monitoring Platform (AEMP) information document. The developer must contact the Council's chosen AEMP supplier (Energence Ltd) on commencement of construction to facilitate the monitoring process.",
    "c)\tUpon final completion of the development and prior to occupation, the developer must submit to the Council proof of a contractual arrangement with a certified contractor that provides for the ongoing, commissioning, maintenance, and repair of the renewable/low-carbon energy equipment for a period of four years from the point that the building is occupied and the equipment fully operational.",
    "Reason: To monitor the effectiveness and continued operation of the renewable/low carbon energy equipment in order to confirm compliance with energy policies and establish an in-situ evidence base on the performance of such equipment in accordance with London Plan (2021) policy SI2 (\"Be Seen\" stage of the energy hierarchy), Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2026 (3rd April 2012) and Development Management DPD policy 5.2, E5.2.3, and Policy 2.5.36 (Best Practice) of the Mayor's Sustainable Design & Construction SPG.",

Where a development and infrastructure phasing plan is agreed, no occupation shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed development and infrastructure phasing plan, or",
    "c. All wastewater network upgrades required to accommodate the additional flows from the development have been completed.",
    "Reason: Network reinforcement works may be required to accommodate the proposed development. Any reinforcement works identified will be necessary in order to avoid sewage flooding and/or potential pollution incidents. The developer can request information to support the discharge of this condition by visiting the Thames Water website at thameswater.co.uk/preplanning. Should the Local Planning Authority consider the above recommendation inappropriate or are unable to include it in the decision notice, it is important that the Local Planning Authority liaises with Thames Water Development Planning Department (telephone 0203 577 9998) prior to the planning application approval. | No piling shall take place until a piling method statement (detailing the depth and type of piling to be undertaken and the methodology by which such piling will be carried out, including measures to prevent and minimise the potential for damage to subsurface water infrastructure, and the programme for the works) has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority in consultation with Thames Water. Any piling must be undertaken in accordance with the terms of the approved piling method statement.",
    "Reason: The proposed works will be in close proximity to underground water utility infrastructure. Piling has the potential to impact on local underground water utility infrastructure. | All future residents/leaseholders shall be advised that the rear facing balconies proposed shall not be used for the purposes of hanging items or materials such as clothes/linen, that could be blown onto the neighbouring railway tracks.",
