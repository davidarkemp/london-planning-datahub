    "The proposed picture windows and raised decking by reason of scale and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly development that would lead to overlooking and a loss of privacy to the neighbouring property to the northeast at no. 23 Osterley Park View Road. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
