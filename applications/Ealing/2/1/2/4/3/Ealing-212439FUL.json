    "The application would harmfully reduce the size and scale of the units granted under prior approval application 181064PRDIS through alteration to their internal layout. This was not referenced in the description of development and would cause significant harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers as well as the living conditions of the adjacent properties. This would be contrary to Policies D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. It would also be contrary to the Technical Housing Standard. | The application has failed to show that the development would not be an incongruous or discordant feature with regards the adjacent buildings and the street scene. It is therefore contrary to planning policies such as the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The size of the units as well as the proportions of the proposed bedrooms would be under the required minimum GIA as set out in the London Plan and Technical Housing Standards. The scheme is therefore deemed to cause significant harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers and would be contrary to planning policies such as policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. It would also be contrary to the Technical Housing Standard. | The proposed amenity spaces would be harmfully undersized. They would also not be of sufficient standard or quality and would not provide a usable space. The siting would also cause harm to the adjacent rooms or the adjacent garden area. This is therefore contrary to 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013 | The proposed development would be in close proximity to clear glazed openings on adjoining properties and given the orientation, it could harmfully impact upon light and outlook entering the neighbouring properties. As the details concerning this are extremely limited, it has not been satisfactorily proven that the proposed development would not cause significant harm to the living conditions of the adjacent properties in terms of loss of light and loss of outlook. It is therefore contrary to planning policies such as the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 | The introduction of windows to the ground floor flat (to the rear of the site) would cause harm to the adjacent house and garden area in terms of overlooking and loss of privacy. This would therefore be contrary to Planning Policies such as London Plan (2021) policy D6 and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed bike store by reason of its inadequate size would fail to provide sufficient storage space for 10 bicycles and would therefore be contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan."
