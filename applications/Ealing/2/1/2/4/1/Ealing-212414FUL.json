    "The proposed development by reason of its design, appearance, scale and cumulative overdevelopment of the site would constitute an incongruous and unsympathetic development to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the subject site, that of the surrounding area and would adversely affect the outlook from the garden of No. 179 Noel Road. Additionally, the proposed retention of the outbuilding in its current scale and mass would remove the private garden space for Flat B approved under ref. PP/2014/1167 to the detriment of the living conditions of these occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) Chapter 12, the London Plan (2021) policy D4, and the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4, 7B and 7D."
