As such the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and National Planning Policy Framework 2019 - Section 12 - Achieving well-designed places. | The proposed private amenity which subdivides the existing garden would be out of keeping with the pattern of development which features larger gardens and would detract from the character and appearance of the wider area and would be detrimental to the visual amenities. As such the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and National Planning Policy Framework 2019 - Section 12 - Achieving well-designed places. | The proposed building given it positioning very close to the end of Chaucer Road without the set back, limits opportunities to soften the appearance of the proposal through soft landscaping and planting detrimental to the streetscape and urban green objectives contray to",
