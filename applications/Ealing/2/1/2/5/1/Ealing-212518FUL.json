    "The proposed building, by reason of its location, height, scale, massing, prominence, design, and poor landscaping, would result in a cramped, overbearing and contrived form of development and would create an unattractive frontage to Uxbridge Road, which would be at odds with the prevailing urban grain, would have a poor relationship with the established built form, would detract from the character and appearance of the area and would cause detrimental harm to the visual amenity of the public realm. The development therefore runs contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies D3, D4, D8 and G5 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies 1.1, 1.2 and 2.1 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed building, by reason of its siting, height, massing, proximity to neighbouring residential uses and access arrangements, would result in increased comings and goings from the site via a shared accessway and associated noise and sleep disturbance, would result in overshadowing and loss of light, would result in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook, and would result in overlooking and loss of privacy, which would cumulatively result in detrimental harm to the living conditions of 1 Wharncliffe Drive and 431 Uxbridge Road, and to the detriment of the amenity and enjoyment of neighbouring residential rear gardens. The development therefore runs contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies D3, D6, and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies 1.1, 1.2 and 2.1 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed residential units, by reason of long and narrow corridors, narrow plans, lack of and poor quality amenity spaces, lack of accessibility for users of differing needs and inadequate cycle storage facilities, would result in an inefficient and contrived layout, would fail to provide wheelchair turning circles and manoeuvrability, would create unusable and overlooked amenity spaces that would be subject to noise disturbance and air pollution, and would fail to provide adequate facilities for future occupiers to the detriment of living conditions of future occupiers. The development therefore runs contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies D6, D7, H2, SI 8 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies 1.1, 1.2 and 2.1 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012)."
