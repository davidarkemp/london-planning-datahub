    "The proposal by reason of its siting, design, site coverage, appearance and scale would constitute an overdevelopment of a constrained site with a cramped, incongruous and dominant appearance that would be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development of the area and harmful to visual amenity of the street scene and character of the area.  As such, it is contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposal by reason of its siting, design, site coverage, appearance and scale would constitute an overdevelopment of a constrained site that would cause harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring properties through appearing overbearing, loss of outlook, loss of light and loss of perceived privacy. As such, it is contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposed development would fail to provide an acceptable level and quality of internal accommodation or an acceptable amount or quality of private outdoor amenity space, there would also be insufficient cycle parking and refuse and recycling storage provision, which would result in poor quality living conditions for future residents, contrary to policies D4, SI8 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
