    "The proposed alterations to the ground floor commercial unit, due to its inadequate floor area, is considered to result in commercial unit that would not be viable in the secondary shopping frontage location. It is therefore contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 4B, 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The first floor as shown on the existing plans has not been constructed as per the approved plans for planning permission 194300FUL and the current application seeks to alter the layout and decrease unit sizes of this extant permission. The change of use and alterations toof the first floor therefore needs to be considered under this current application. As the proposal would provide thirteen (13) units and as there is zero (0) affordable housing provision, the scheme is contrary to Planning Policies such as 3A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and H4 of the London Plan 2021. | The proposed first floor studio flat 3, due to its inadequate GIA of 33m2, would provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers. The lack of any amenity space for all of the residential units would also cause harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers. This is contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), the Technical Housing Standards and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposal, which would increase the number of residential units on the site, would be likely to increase the demand for on-street parking and exacerbate car-parking stress in the area. Inadequate information was submitted regarding parking to allow the Local Planning Authority to assess whether the application site would be suitable from a highway point of view for the development proposed. This would therefore be contrary to Policies D6, T5, T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 1.1 (f) of the Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development would fail to provide a mix of dwelling type and size to meet the housing needs of Borough, and to encourage a mixed and balanced community.. It is therefore contrary to Policy H10 of the London Plan 2021  . It would also be contrary to the criteria raised in the Ealing Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 2018. | The proposed development has failed to demonstrate the location of the refuse store for the amended and proposed residential units. Given the limited outside space, this would cause harm to both the living conditions of the future occupiers and with regards highway safety. This would also cause harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area and would be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3, D4 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013."
