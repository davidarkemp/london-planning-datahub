    "The proposed first and second floor rear extension due to its siting, size and closeness to neighbouring properties appear likely to have a harmful effect on the residential amenity presently enjoyed by adjoining occupiers by reason of, loss of light, and loss of outlook and enclosure effects on rear and flank wall windows. As such the proposal is considered to be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, policies 1.1 (g) (h), 1.2 (h) and 4.1 (d) of the adopted Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies ELV 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013). | The proposed House in Multiple Occupation (HMO), by reason of its inadequate kitchen and bathroom facilities for its potential occupancy, would provide a substandard form of residential accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document, Policies D1, D3, D4, D6, H9, of the London Plan (2021), and published Ealing Council HMO guidelines.' | The proposal does not demonstrate adequate refuse and recycling storage or space for the required covered and secure cycle storage and also presents an unacceptable increase in parking pressure outside the hours of operation of the CPZ (particularly in the evenings and at weekends) notwithstanding any restriction on parking permits for the CPZ for occupiers of the development. As such the proposed development would be contrary to London Plan (2021) policies T5, T6 and SI8 and policies 3.5, 7.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The proposed roof lights due to their design are considered out of keeping with the original building and harmful to the character of the Ealing Town Centre conservation area contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD, and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
