    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.",

    "Reason: The local planning authority considers that further development could cause detriment to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby properties or to the character of the area and for this reason would wish to control any future development to comply with section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2015. | As shown on the approved plans, the proposed window within the flank elevation of the dwelling hereby approved, shall be obscure glazed and retained so in perpetuity.
