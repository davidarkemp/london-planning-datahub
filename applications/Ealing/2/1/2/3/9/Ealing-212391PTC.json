  "description": "On 6 March 2019 Ealing Council permitted me to contract a specialist to trim 6 trees and remove 1 tree.  These works were carried out immediately on receipt of consent.\n\nI now wish to reduce the current tree canopy of the 6 remaining trees to the previous pruning point as undertaken by the tree contractor 2 years ago and as approved by you in that letter dated 6 March 2019.  I attach a plan showing the location of the trees -  5 in the back garden and 1 in the front garden.  The Leylandi (T1-4) have grown back very quickly and are encroaching on the patio and house.",
