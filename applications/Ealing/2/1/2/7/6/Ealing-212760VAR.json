    "The proposed alterations to the fa√ßade of the existing building would not meet the Council's criteria for a 'minor material' amendment. Additionally, the proposed fails to provide high quality design, visual interest and relief  for this prominent frontage due to its retained red brick finish, disproportionately sized ground floor windows and poorly sited first floor window. As such, the building would remain an incongruous and poor quality development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the surrounding area and locality in general. The proposed would fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan(2021); policies 7.4 and 7B of Ealing's Development Management DPD(2013) and the NPPF(2021) paragraphs 134 and 135. | The proposed development fails to provide planting and adequate cycle parking for the scheme as previously provided in approved scheme 178004FUL dated 02.02.2018. As such, the proposal fails to comply with policies D3, D4, T5 and table 10.2 of the London Plan(2021); policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of Ealing's Development Management DPD(2013) and the NPPF(2021) paragraphs 134 and 135."
