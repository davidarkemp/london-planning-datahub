    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings: PA-01.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of the installation, operation, and maintenance of the odour abatement equipment and extract system, including the height of the extract duct and vertical discharge outlet without cowl at least 1m above the eaves of the main building. Details shall be provided of a reasonable distance of the extract outlet approximately 20.0meters from any openable window unless effective odour control is installed, of equipment and ducting to be fitted with anti-vibration mounts and silencers and of additional mitigation measures as necessary to ensure that noise and vibration transmission via internal ceilings, walls and external façades will meet the Council's standards specified in the SPG10. Approved details shall be implemented prior to use and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with standard 30 of the Housing SPG, policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of the external rating noise level emitted from plant/machinery/equipment/ducting/air in- and outlets/mechanical installations, together with mitigation measures as appropriate. The measures shall ensure that the external rating noise level LAeq emitted will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity. A post installation sound assessment shall be carried out where required to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and additional steps to mitigate noise shall be taken, as necessary.  Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation/ use of plant/ machinery/ equipment and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies  1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of type and level of noise from commercial development likely to affect noise sensitive adjoining neighbours and the sound insulation value of the floor/ceiling/walls separating the commercial premises from dwellings. Details shall demonstrate that the sound insulation value is enhanced by at least 10/15/20dB above the Building Regulations value for residential use and that, where necessary, additional mitigation measures are implemented to contain commercial noise within the commercial premises. Where noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level should not exceed NR25 Leq 5mins (octaves) or NR20 Leq 5mins (1/3 octaves) inside a bedroom and NR30 Leq 5mins (octaves) or NR25 Leq 5mins (1/3 octaves) inside a living room. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards of the Council's SPG10. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies  1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | No removal of refuse nor bottles/cans to external bins or areas at the development shall be carried out other than between the hours of 08:00 to 20:00 on Monday to Saturday and 10:00 to 20:00 on Sundays and Public/Bank Holidays.",
