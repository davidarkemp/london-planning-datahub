    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall be in accordance with those indicated on the submitted application form and plans listed in Condition 2.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The detached outbuilding hereby approved shall be used only for domestic purposes incidental to the dwelling on this site, and shall not be used for separate habitable accommodation, letting or any commercial use. No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed at any time.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to the felling of the olive tree identified in drawing SO-007-17, details of the replacement tree to be planted in the rear garden shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The details shall include the girth, species and age of the replacement tree, its location within the rear garden, adequate soil volume provision to allow the tree to grow to maturity, and a five-year maintenance and inspection schedule.",
    "Reason: To ensure that trees of value, which contribute to the special character of the conservation area, are replaced in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Ealing SPG 9. | Other than the olive tree identified in drawing SO-007-17, no trees, shrubs or hedges, within, or in proximity of, the site shall be felled, uprooted, wilfully damaged or destroyed, cut back in any way or removed without previous written consent of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Any trees, shrubs or hedges removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming seriously diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced with shrubs or hedge plants or similar species capable of achieving a comparable size unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.",
    "Reason: To ensure appropriate tree protection in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with Ealing SPG 9, policy 5.10 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies SI 1, SI 2 and G7 of the London Plan (2021). | Any planting that is part of the approved scheme that within a period of five years after planting is removed, dies or becomes seriously damaged or diseased, shall be replaced in the next planting season and all planting shall be replaced with others of a similar size and species and in the same position, unless the Local Planning Authority first gives written consent to any variation.",
