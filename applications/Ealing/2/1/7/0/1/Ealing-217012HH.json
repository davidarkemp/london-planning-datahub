    "The proposed two storey side extension; by reason of its siting, excessive width and scale and relationship with the site boundary; and the proposed front porch extension, by reason of its sitting and design; would cumulatively fail to remain sympathetic to the existing dwellinghouse and would be of detriment to the historic character of the surrounding Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area.  As such the proposed development would be contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990; Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021); Policy D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 7.4, 7B & 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Supplementary Planning Document 4 - Residential  Extensions and Hanger Lane Haymills Estate Conservation Area Management Plan (2008)"
