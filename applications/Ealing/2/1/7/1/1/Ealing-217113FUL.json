    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building and shall be consistent with those as listed within the submitted application form and the drawings / plans as listed in  Condition (2).",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD  (2013) policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7B, policies 1.1 (h), 1.2 (g) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Cycle storage for one additional (1) bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the site, within a secure, lockable compound in accordance with all adopted standards prior to occupation of the building and be continuously available and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate bicycle storage to align with Sustainable Transport SPG and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within an enclosure has been provided within the front garden of the property, in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",

The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards of the Council's SPG10 and the criteria of BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self noise). The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
