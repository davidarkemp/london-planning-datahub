The installation of the monitoring devices and the submission and format of the data shall be carried out in accordance with the Council's approved specifications as indicated in the Automated Energy Monitoring Platform (AEMP) information document. The developer must contact the Council's chosen AEMP supplier (Energence Ltd) on commencement of construction to facilitate the monitoring process.",
    "c)\tUpon final completion of the development and prior to occupation, the developer must submit to the Council proof of a contractual arrangement with a certified contractor that provides for the ongoing, commissioning, maintenance, and repair of the renewable/low-carbon energy equipment for a period of four years from the point that the building is occupied and the equipment fully operational. Any repair or maintenance of the energy equipment must be carried out within one month of a performance problem being identified.",
    "Reason: To monitor the effectiveness and continued operation of the renewable/low carbon energy equipment in order to confirm compliance with energy policies and establish an in-situ evidence base on the performance of such equipment in accordance with London Plan (2021) policy SI2 (\"Be Seen\" stage of the energy hierarchy), Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2026 (3rd April 2012) and Development Management DPD policy 5.2, E5.2.3, and Policy 2.5.36 (Best Practice) of the Mayor's Sustainable Design & Construction SPG. | In order to demonstrate compliance with the 'be seen' post-construction monitoring requirement of Policy SI2 of the London Plan, the legal Owner shall at all times and all in all respects comply with the energy monitoring requirements set out in points a, b and c below. In the case of non-compliance the legal Owner shall upon written notice from the Local Planning Authority immediately take all steps reasonably required to remedy non-compliance.",
    "a)\tWithin four weeks of planning permission being issued by the Local Planning Authority, the Owner is required to submit to the GLA accurate and verified estimates of the 'be seen' energy performance indicators, as outlined in Chapter 3 'Planning stage' of the GLA 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance document, for the consented development. This should be submitted to the GLA's monitoring portal in accordance with the 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance.",
    "b)\tOnce the as-built design has been completed (upon commencement of RIBA Stage 6) and prior to the building(s) being occupied (or handed over to a new legal owner, if applicable), the legal Owner is required to provide updated accurate and verified estimates of the 'be seen' energy performance indicators for each reportable unit of the development, as per the methodology outlined in Chapter 4 'As-built stage' of the GLA 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance. All data and supporting evidence should be uploaded to the GLA's monitoring portal. In consultation with the Council's chosen Automated Energy Monitoring Platform provider the owner should also confirm that suitable monitoring devices have been installed and maintained for the monitoring of the in-use energy performance indicators, as outlined in Chapter 5 'In-use stage' of the GLA 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance document.",
    "c)\tUpon completion of the first year of occupation following the end of the defects liability period (DLP) and for the following four years, the legal Owner is required to provide accurate and verified annual in-use energy performance data for all relevant indicators under each reportable unit of the development as per the methodology outlined in Chapter 5 'In-use stage' of the GLA 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance document. All data and supporting evidence should be uploaded to the GLA's monitoring portal. This condition will be satisfied after the legal Owner has reported on all relevant indicators"
