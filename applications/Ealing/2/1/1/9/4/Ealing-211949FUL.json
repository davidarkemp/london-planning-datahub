  "description": "Rear roof extension to rear outrigger roof slope incorporating a balcony and installation of three roof lights to main rear roof slope; alteration to external elevation to first floor flat",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear roof extensions, by reason of their design, bulk, scale, massing and position within the roofspace (of the rear roof extension), would constitute an overly large and intrusive extension that is out of character with the pattern of the development of the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Interim Supplementary Planning Documents SPD4 Residential Extensions. | The proposed development by virtue of its design, would result in undue losses of privacy of the occupancy of habitable roof of properties 32-40 Salisbury Road. In addition, the proposal would unduly increase a sense of overlooking and loss of privacy to the rear gardens of The Ground floor flat 39 Balfour Road, the adjacent properties 37 and 41 Balfour Road, and 32-40 Salisbury Road. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
