    "The proposed rear roof extensions, by reason of their design within the roofspace (of the rear roof terrace), would constitute an intrusive extension that is out of character with the pattern of the development of the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Interim Supplementary Planning Documents SPD4 Residential Extensions.",

As such, the proposal is considered contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
