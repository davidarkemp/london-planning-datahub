    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Other than the balconies identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2, no part of the roof shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",
    "Reason:  To protect the living conditions of nearby properties in accordance with policies D4 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), polices 7.4, 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013) and polices 1.1 (e)(g), 1.2 (f), 2.1(c) and 2.10 Core Strategy (2012). | The screening or enclosure to the balcony as shown on the approved plans shall be implemented before the development is first occupied and retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason:  To protect residential amenity, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",

    "Prior to commencement of the development, a noise assessment (according to standards of the Council's SPG10) shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of external noise levels from transport and industrial/ commercial/ cultural sources. Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal room standards of SPG10 and noise limits specified by BS8233:2014. Details of best practicable mitigation measures to achieve these criteria also in external amenity shall be submitted. The approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

    "Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of type and level of noise from the commercial development affecting residents and the sound insulation value of the floor/ceiling/walls separating the dwellings from commercial premises. Details shall demonstrate that the sound insulation value is enhanced by at least 10/15/20dB, as appropriate, above the Building Regulations value for residential use and that, where necessary, additional mitigation measures are implemented to contain commercial noise within the commercial premises. Where noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level should not exceed NR25 Leq 5mins (octaves) or NR20 Leq 5mins (1/3 octaves) inside a bedroom and NR30 Leq 5mins (octaves) or NR25 Leq 5mins (1/3 octaves) inside a living room. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards of the Council's SPG10. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

    "| External noise from machinery/equipment/extract/ventilation ducting/mechanical installations",
    "The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
