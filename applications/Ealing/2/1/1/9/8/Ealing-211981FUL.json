    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The vehicle parking arrangements of the approved scheme shall be marked out on the site prior to first occupation of the hereby approved flats, and these spaces shall be kept continuously available and shall not be used for any other purpose. No additional car parking shall be formed or made available except with the prior permission of the Local Planning Authority obtained through the submission of a planning application.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the off-street parking does not prejudice pedestrian safety in accordance with policies T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | No part of the roof of the single storey rear extension shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",

If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented as necessary in external amenity spaces to achieve these criteria.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise and vibration, in accordance with policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPG10. | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to and approved by the Council, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 10dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, namely, kitchen/living/dining room above bedroom of separate dwelling and ground floor bedroom adjoining main entrance to first floor flat. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
