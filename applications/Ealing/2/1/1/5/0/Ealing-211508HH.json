  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its bulk, width, siting, unsympathetic design and roof profile, would be an incongruous form of development that would fail to be subordinate to the host dwelling or consistent with the prevailing pattern of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the objectives of policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
