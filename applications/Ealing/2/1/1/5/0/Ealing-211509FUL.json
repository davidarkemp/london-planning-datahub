    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building and shall be consistent with those as listed within the submitted application form and the drawings / plans as listed in Condition (2).",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7B, policies 1.1 (h), 1.2 (g) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | Cycle storage for five (5) bicycle spaces shall be provided within the front curtilage of the site, in accordance with drawing PL-100 Rev A, within a secure, lockable compound in accordance with all adopted standards prior to occupation of the building and be continuously available and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate bicycle storage to align with Sustainable Transport SPG and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within an enclosure has been provided within the front garden of the property, in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D3 and SI8 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed rooflights hereby approved shall not project more than 150mm from the roof plane and retained as such for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To minimise light spillage and interference with the privacy and outlook of adjoining occupiers and in the interests of good neighbourliness and in accordance with policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | No part of the flat roofs of the proposed dwellinghouse shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof terrace/garden or similar amenity area.",
