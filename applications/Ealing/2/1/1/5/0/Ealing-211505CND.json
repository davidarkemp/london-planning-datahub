    "Insufficient information has been submitted to establish that the proposed Fire Safety Statement would adequately discharge the necessary components of condition 11, which seeks to determine how the development proposal would function in terms of the building's construction; means of escape; features which reduce risk to life; access for service personnel and equipment; and any future modifications would not compromise the building's fire safety measures. Accordingly, the submitted details do not achieve compliance with London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D11."
