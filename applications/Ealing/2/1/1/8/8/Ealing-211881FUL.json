    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title(s) Location Plan; Block Plan; 908/01A (Existing Basement Plan); 908/02 (Existing Ground Floor Plan); 908/03 (Existing First Floor Plan); 908/04 (Existing Second Floor Plan); 908/05B (Existing Elevations);",
    "1098/01 rev C (Proposed Basement Plan); 1098/02 rev D (Proposed Ground Floor Plan); 1098/03 rev C (Proposed First Floor Plan); 1098/04 rev C (Proposed Second Floor Plan); A1 (Bike Shelter Drawing); 1098/05 (Proposed Elevations)",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Cycle storage for ^IN;  bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the development, within secure, lockable compounds in accordance with the designated locations identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and all adopted standards prior to the first occupation of the building. The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:  To provide adequate bicycle storage in accordance with policy and T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided within the rear garden of the site. The minimum capacity of refuse and recycling storage shall be 1,330L and have an equal 50/50 split of refuse and recycling storage. The refuse storage must be in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and must be fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| No cooking facilities shall be installed at any time in any of the rooms. All cooking and preparation of hot food shall take place within the communal kitchens identified on the approved plans.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the HMO rooms are not wholly self-contained and to protect the amenity of the occupants of each of the rooms and neighbouring properties, in accordance with Policy D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Council HMO Licensing Guidelines. | The proposed kitchens at basement and second floor levels shall provide for a minimum cumulative total of 3 kitchen sets, with each kitchen set to provide for a cooker with four rings and oven (total of 3 x cookers with a total of 12 rings and 3 x ovens required). The kitchens shall collectively also provide for 3 x sinks. A total of 12 power points in the kitchens are required. The total kitchen requirements shall be implemented in full, prior to the first occupation of the premises and retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure compliance with Council's HMO standards and to provide satisfactory living conditions for future residents, in accordance with Policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy LV3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The maximum number of persons occupying the house in multiple occupation hereby approved shall be limited to no more than thirteen bedrooms, to accommodate a maximum of thirteen residents.",
    "Reason:  To protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of the future occupants of the development in accordance with policies 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy 1.1 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy; and policy D4 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "| The proposed development shall be a car-free development with the rear garden of the site not to accommodate any parking of private vehicles. The rear garden space shall only be used for cycle storage, refuse storage and outdoor amenity.",
    "Reason: The existing car park would no longer be suitable for car parking due to the inability for vehicles to manoeuvre within the site. Car parking shall also be restricted to ensure that residents use more sustainable forms of transportation, in the interests of highway safety and sustainability. | The sound insulation of the floor/ceiling /wall structures separating communal main entrance/ stairs/ kitchen/living/circulation space/bathrooms from bedrooms shall be enhanced by at least 5dB above the recommended Building Regulations value.  The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Policies â¦ Standard 30 of the Housing SPG, Policy D14 of the London Plan and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
