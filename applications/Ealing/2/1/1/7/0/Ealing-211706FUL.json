    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "| The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the drawings: Design and Access Statement, A101, A102, A103, A104, A2, A200, A202, A204, A205, received 05.02.2021, A201, received 01.04.2021",
    "REASON: For avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.",
    "| Refuse and recycling storage facilities as indicated on the hereby approved plans listed in condition 2, shall be implemented and operational before the first occupation of any part of the development, and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate disposal, storage and collection of waste and recycling, in accordance with policies with policies 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Cycle parking facilities as indicated on the hereby approved plans listed in condition 2, shall be implemented and operational before the first use of any part of the development hereby approved, and permanently retained thereafter, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. A minimum of four (4) cycle parking spaces shall be provided and located in a secure undercover and lockable compound.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate bicycle storage to align with Sustainable Transport SPG and policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The assessment of sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall have regard to the Council's assessment standards in the SPG10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D11 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019).",
    "| Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, namely, kitchen/living/dining room above bedroom of separate dwelling and a bedroom adjoining the communal main entrance. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Standard 30 of the Housing SPG and Policy D11 of the London Plan (2021)",
    "| Prior to the commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority, for the installation in the dwellings of a filtered fresh air ventilation system capable of mitigating elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in the external air. The details to be submitted shall include the arrangements for continuously maintaining the operational efficiency of the system.  The ventilation system as approved shall be completed prior to occupation and shall be retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of surrounding premises is not adversely affected by pollution or other emissions from the site, in accordance with Policies D5, D6 and D11 of The London Plan (2021).",
    "| All Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) of net power of 37kW and up to and including 560kW used during the course of the demolition, site preparation and construction phases shall comply with the emission standards set out in chapter 7 of the GLA's supplementary planning guidance \"Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition\" dated July 2014 (SPG), or subsequent guidance. Unless it complies with the standards set out in the SPG, no NRMM shall be on site, at any time, whether in use or not, without the prior written consent of the local planning authority. The developer shall keep an up to date list of all NRMM used during the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development on the online register at https://nrmm.london/.",
