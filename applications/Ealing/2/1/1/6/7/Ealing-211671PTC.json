  "description": "Rear Garden:\n1. Two plum trees marked T1 and T2 located on the eastern side of the rear garden. In order to improve light and space in the garden, the proposed works are to:\na) Fell both to ground level by section take down; and\nb) Grind out both stumps to approx. 300-500mm below ground level.\n\n2. One bay laurel tree marked T3 located on the eastern side of the rear garden. This tree dominates the garden and is blocking out valuable sun light. In order to shape and contain and also to improve light and space in the garden, the proposed works are to:\na) Reduce total height to between approx. 4-8 feet and reshape, reducing to suitable new growth points; and\nb) Remove any weak suppressed branches.\n\n3. One fallen apple tree marked T4 located on the eastern side of the rear garden near to the shed. Suggested works are to:\na) Remove fallen trunk and branches, and fell remainder to ground level; and\nb) Grind out stump approx. 300-500mm below ground level.",
