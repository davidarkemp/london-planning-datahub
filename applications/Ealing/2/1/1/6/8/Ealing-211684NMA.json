  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal cannot be accepted as a non-material amendment to planning permission Ref: 204071FUL dated: 22/12/2020, in respect S96A of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for Non-Material amendments following a grant of Planning Permission (2011), as it would constitute an increase in the scale of the approved development compromising its design and appearance. The resultant dwelling would present a rear projection at both first floor level and ground floor level, that would project beyond the established rear building lines of the terrace. The existing staggered ground floor rear projection as approved provides a design relationship between the new dwelling and the adjoining dwelling, which would be lost as a result of this proposed amendment, resulting in a poorer design outcome."
