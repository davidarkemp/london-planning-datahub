    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, footprint, shape, massing, roof profile and design, would result in a cramped and contrived form of development, and would create dominant and illogical buildings, which would be at odds with which would be at odds with the prevailing urban grain and pattern of development, would have a poor relationship with the established built form and between the buildings, and would cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the area. The development therefore runs contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3, D4, D8 and G5 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies 1.1, 1.2 and 2.1 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed residential units, by reason of inadequate floorspace, unsatisfactory privacy, poor outlook and light, light spillage, contrived layouts, insufficient storage space, poor quality amenity spaces, narrow plans and lack of accessibility for users of differing needs, would result in an substandard living accommodation, would create overshadowed and overlooked amenity spaces subject to noise disturbance and air pollution, and would fail to provide wheelchair turning circles and manoeuvrability to the detriment of living conditions of future occupiers. The development therefore runs contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D6, D7, H2, SI 8 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies 1.1, 1.2 and 2.1 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed vehicular crossover and vehicle parking spaces, by reason of its location, proximity to the junction of Wharncliffe Drive and Uxbridge Road and a street tree, inability to enter and egress in a forward gear, and extension of an existing vehicle crossover, would result in a reduction of on-street vehicle parking bay, increased competition for on-street parking bays, and harm to trees of value and pedestrian and highway safety, to the detriment of the capacity and safety of the local transport network and the visual amenity of the street. The development therefore runs contrary to policies T4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021)."
