    "The proposed development by reason of its design, scale, depth and appearance in conjunction with the existing extension would result in an incongruous and overbearing addition to the original property, to the detriment of the character of the area and the architectural integrity of the building/ As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and SPD4 'Residential Extensions'. | The proposed extension by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would result in an unneighbourly form of development to the detriment of the residential amenity of No. 81 The Vale, by way of being overbearing and an increased sense of enclosure, contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
