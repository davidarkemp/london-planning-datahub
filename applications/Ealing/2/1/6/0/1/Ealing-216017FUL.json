    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Prior to the installation of the extract duct, details of the external rating noise level emitted from plant/ machinery/ equipment/ ducting/air in- and outlets/mechanical installations, together with mitigation measures as appropriate shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing.  The measures shall ensure that the external rating noise level LAeq emitted will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity.  Where required, a post installation sound assessment shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The assessment shall be carried out to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and shall include additional steps to mitigate noise, as necessary. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation/ use of plant/ machinery/ equipment and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason:   To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'. | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",

Details shall be provided of a reasonable distance of the extract outlet approximately 20.0meters from any openable window unless effective odour control is installed. Approved details shall be implemented prior to use and thereafter be permanently retained.",
