If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve criteria specified in BS8233:2014.
