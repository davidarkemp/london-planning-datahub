    "The proposed extension, by reason of its width, depth, height, siting, roof profile, design and fenestration, would result in the loss of special design features of the Conservation Area, would fail to respect the design and detailing of the original dwelling, and would result in a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to neighbouring sites, to the detriment of the special character of the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area and the amenities of 42 Brentham Way. It therefore runs contrary to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3, D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Plan, the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area Policy & Design Guide (as amended 2012)."
