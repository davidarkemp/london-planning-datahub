    "Reason: To ensure appropriate tree protection in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies 5.10 and 7.21 of the London Plan, policy 5.10 of Ealing's Development Management DPD and Ealing's SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines. | No trees, shrubs or hedges within the site which are shown to be retained on the approved plans (Plan/Drawing:) shall be felled, uprooted, damaged or destroyed, cut back in any way or removed without previous written consent of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Any shrubs or hedges removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming seriously diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced with shrubs or hedge plants or similar species capable of achieving a comparable size unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.",
    "If a tree marked on the tree report to be retained is removed without consent, or dying, or being severely damaged, or becoming seriously diseased (crown more than 50% sparse), within 5 years from the start of work on the development hereby permitted, a replacement tree shall be planted on the site or surrounding area reflecting the CAVAT value of the tree, or a proportion of its value reflecting the damage. This penalty shall be sought, unless the Local Planning Authority has given written consent to any variation.",
    "Reason: to secure the protection throughout the time that development is being carried out, of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within the site which are of important amenity value to the local landscape. | No operations (including initial site clearance) shall commence on site in connection with development hereby approved until a suitable foundation specification has been submitted and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The foundation details shall include the following:",
    "o Use bore hole that are the small diameter necessary to the appropriate depth to create the piles.",
    "o Beams that span between the piles are to be laid on or above ground level. The floor must have a void above ground-level of at least 100mm.",
    "o The specification should not require digging down below ground-level (beyond the creation of the piles) or otherwise disturb the existing ground-level.",
    "o To provide water and oxygen access for the tree's roots the void below the floor must be vented by airbricks, whilst rainwater should be directed down below the floor (not into a soakaway).",
    "Reason: In order to safeguard trees and other vegetation considered to be worthy of retention in the interests of amenity for the area."
