    "The proposed roof extensions and balcony/terrace, by reason of its design, siting and appearance, would constitute an incongruous form of development, that would not be consistent with the prevailing pattern of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area.  In addition, the proposed roof terrace in an elevated position, close to windows of neighbouring properties and visible to the street scene of Talbot Road, due to potential impacts on overlooking and noise disturbance. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies D3, D4 and D14 of the London Plan, Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and SPD4 (Residential Extensions)."
