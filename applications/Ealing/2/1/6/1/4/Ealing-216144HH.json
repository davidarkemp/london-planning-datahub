    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, design and roof profile, would result in an overbearing, insubordinate and out of keeping development that would be at odds with the original style of the host dwelling and traditional setting of the Conservation Area and would negatively impact upon neighbouring amenities, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the dwelling and Conservation Area, and the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The development would therefore run contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D3, D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area Management Plan (2008)."
