    "The existing use of the property is a sui generis (beauty salon) use, of which there are no permitted changes to Class E uses within the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). The proposed change of use would therefore not be lawful and planning permission would be required. | The proposed extraction flue to the rear would materially affect the listed buildings character and appearance as a building of special architectural and historic interest. It would also have an impact on the Ealing Green Conservation Area given its visibility from the Grove. Listed Building Consent and Planning Permission would be accordingly required. It is should also be noted that the proposal for an extraction flue close to residential uses can result in noise, vibration and odour nuisance and planning permission would be required with mitigation measures provided."
