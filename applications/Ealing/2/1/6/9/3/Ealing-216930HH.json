    "The outbuilding and pergola structure, by reason of its scale, represents an overly large and insubordinate addition to the host dwelling, which has resulted in less than substantial harm to the Churchfields Conservation Area, which is not outweighed by public benefits. The development is, therefore, contrary to Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of The London Plan (2021), Policy 1.2 of the Development Strategy 2026 Development Plan Document (2012), and Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The, raised decking, outbuilding and pergola structure, by reason of its siting, scale, and height, represents an unneighbourly form of development that has resulted in a loss of privacy, loss of outlook, and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties of nos. 24 and 28 Half Acre Road. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at these neighbouring properties has been unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
