    "The proposal would remove the garden space of number 33 Hazeltree Lane. This along with the proposed size, scale and siting of the proposed houses would represent an overdevelopment of the plot. The proposed design of the new dwellings would also not be in keeping. The location, form and relationship with its context would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area, and its character and appearance would be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013.",
    "| The proposed development, by virtue of its siting and the location of the proposed windows to the front and side elevation of the new houses would give rise to direct overlooking of the garden areas of the neighbouring properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development, by reason of inadequate GIA as well as undersized bedrooms would provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). It would also be contrary to the Technical Housing Standards.",
    "| The lack of information/ details and the limited space within the site with regards refuse and cycle parking would either cause harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers or the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. It is therefore contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013."
