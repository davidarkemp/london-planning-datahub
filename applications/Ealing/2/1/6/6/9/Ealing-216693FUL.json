    "The proposed dwelling, by reasons of its proximity to boundaries, forward projection, siting, bulk, scale and massing, represent an incongruous, discordant and cramped form of development, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenity of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. The proposed dwelling, particularly its siting, height and bulk, would also result in significant overshadowing of the existing garden at no. 27, which would result in significant impacts on the quality of the existing amenity space and the living conditions of this adjoining property. The proposal would also fail to comply with Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proposed dwelling, by reason of its inadequate internal floor to ceiling heights, and unsatisfactory private amenity space provision, would represent a poor quality and substandard form of residential accommodation, resulting in the detrimental harm to the living conditions of future residents. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies LV3.5 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD, the Mayor's Housing SPG and the Technical Housing Standards. | The proposed loss of off-street carparking in this location would increase parking stress within the Controlled Parking Zone, which would have a detrimental impact on the free flow of traffic and pedestrian and highway safety. The proposed dwelling also fails to provide an adequate amount of cycle parking spaces for the dwelling, resulting in a form of development that does not encourage a modal shift to more sustainable forms of transportation. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies T3, T4 and T5 of the London Plan (2021)"
