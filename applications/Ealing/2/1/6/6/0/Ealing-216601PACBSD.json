    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. | The proposal falls within the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015. Prior Approval is required and granted. | Prior to the commencement of the development, except for site clearance, demolition or ground works, a noise assessment (according to standards of the Council's SPG10) of external noise levels from transport and industrial/ commercial/ cultural sources (incl. reflected and re-radiated noise where appropriate) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Council. Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal room- and (if provided) external amenity noise standards in accordance with the criteria of BS8233:2014 and SPG10. Approved details shall be implemented prior to the first occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Ealing SPG10. | Prior to the commencement of the development, except for site clearance, demolition or ground works, details of enhanced sound insulation of at least 10dB above the Building Regulations value for residential use for the floor/ceiling/walls separating the commercial use from dwellings shall be submitted to the Council and approved in writing. Where noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level shall not exceed NR25 Leq 5mins (octaves) inside a bedroom and NR30 Leq 5mins (octaves) inside a living room. Details of mitigation measures shall include the installation method, materials of separating structures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound/rating level. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to the first occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with standard 30 of the Housing SPG, policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
