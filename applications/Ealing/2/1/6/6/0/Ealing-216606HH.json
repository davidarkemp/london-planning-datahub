    "The proposed two-storey side/rear waparound extension by reason of its design, appearance, scale and bulk would result in a form of overdevelopment of the subject site which would adversely affect the character of the original dwellinghouse as well as the character of the area and the visual amenity of the street scene. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed two storey side/rear wraparound extension by reason of scale, bulk, prominence and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development that would have an overbearing nature and lead to a loss of light, loss of outlook, and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties of nos. 39 and 43 Gibbon Road. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
