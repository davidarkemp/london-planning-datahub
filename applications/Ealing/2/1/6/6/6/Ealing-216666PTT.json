Crown reduction is recommended to reduce the height by 30% to reduce the mechanical stress on the tree and prevent it breaking. This may therefore be an alternative to felling the tree for safety reasons.\n\nThe Ash tree (TPO/2008/0478- Figure 2) has dead overhanging branches which need to be removed and overhangs the garden of 6 Chelsea gardens. It is recommended that these are removed for safety purposes.",
