    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title(s) P-11 DR -01 (OS Map and Block Plans); P-11 DR -02 rev A (Existing Plans); P-11 DR -03 rev A (Existing Elevations); P-11 DR -04 rev A (Proposed Plans); BC-11 DR -05 rev A (Proposed Elevations)",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | Notwithstanding the details shown on the plans, all external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing dwelling.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), Polices D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any subsequent amendment, revision or new Order) no windows or other openings (other than those shown on the submitted plans) shall be formed in the walls or roof of the building permitted.",
    "Reason: To protect residential amenity, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), Polices D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The existing outbuilding shall be demolished in full prior to the occupation of the proposed flats, as shown on the approved plans. In the instance that the existing outbuilding is not demolished prior to occupation, this planning permission will lapse and the applicant/developer may be liable for Enforcement Action.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the application site is not over-developed and to ensure that adequate amenity space is provided to the ground floor flat. | Notwithstanding the approved plans, refuse/recycling storage shall be provided and brought into use prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, to protect amenity of the area and in the interests of the future occupants of the development in accordance with policies SI7 & SI8 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | Notwithstanding the submitted plans, 4 cycling spaces for the development shall be provided prior to the first occupation and retained thereafter. The cycle parking spaces shall be secure and covered and shall be retained as such in perpetuity.",
    "Reason: To protect visual amenity and to promote more sustainable forms of transportation, in accordance with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | Prior to commencement of the development, a noise assessment shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of external noise levels from transport and industrial/ commercial/ cultural sources, having regard to the assessment standards of the Council's SPG10. Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10.  Details of best practicable mitigation measures for external amenity spaces shall also be provided and implemented, as necessary. Details shall confirm that noise limits specified in BS8233:2014 will not be exceeded. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

Details of mitigation measures as appropriate and resulting facade/internal levels should be submitted. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policy D14 of the London Plan.",

    "| The sound insulation of the floor/ceiling /wall structures separating different types of rooms/ uses, namely, the communal main entrance adjoining a bedroom, should be enhanced by at least 5dB above the recommended Building Regulations value. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

    "| Prior to the commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority, for the installation in the dwellings of a filtered fresh air ventilation system capable of mitigating elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in the external air. The details to be submitted shall include the arrangements for continuously maintaining the operational efficiency of the system.
