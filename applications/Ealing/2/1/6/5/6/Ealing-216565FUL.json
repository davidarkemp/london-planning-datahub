    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, design, appearance, proportions and siting would result in a cramped form of overdevelopment which would adversely affect the visual amenity of the street scene and the character of the area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the objectives of policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly development on Nos. 40 and 41 Avenue Road, by way of being overbearing and causing an undue sense of enclosure and loss of light.  As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at these neighbouring properties would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal, contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D1 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed development would fail to provide an acceptable amount of quality, private outdoor amenity space, which would result in poor quality living conditions for future residents, contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
