    "The proposed roof terrace and associated enclosure, by reason of its scale, siting, design, height, depth and appearance, would constitute an incongruous and overbearing form of development in an elevated position, would not be consistent with the prevailing pattern of development in the local area, would result in a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to 41 Bollo Bridge Road, and would result in noise disturbance to neighbouring sites to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and residential amenities. As such, the proposal runs contrary to policies D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7A, 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4 (Residential Extensions)."
