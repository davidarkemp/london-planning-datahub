    "The development and use hereby permitted shall be for a temporary period of two (2) years only starting from the date of this decision after which time the building and the associated parking and landscaping shall be removed and the land re-instated in accordance with the relevant approved landscape plan of planning permission P/2012/5040.",
    "Reason: The siting of a temporary building is such that the Local Planning Authority is only prepared to grant permission for a limited period to ensure the viability and success of site and proposed future use for residential-led mixed use development. The limitation of the consent period ensures compliance with policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and section 57(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be retained in accordance with drawing title number(s) and documents: 2014-1948-04 Rev A (Marketing Suite Vehicle Route During Phase 2), 2014-1948-05  Rev E )Marketing Suite Entrance and Vehicular Swept Path Analysis), 2014-1948-08 Rev C (Marketing Suite Vehicle Route During Phase 1), 1-MS-100 Rev C (Marketing Suite - Proposed Site Plan), 1-MS-001 Rev B (Red Line Plan), 1-MS-101 Rev E (Marketing Suite - Proposed Ground Floor Plan), 1-MS-102 Rev A (Proposed Marketing Suite Elevations), 1-MS-001 (Red Line Plan), IA-388-LP-P01 Rev B (Landscape Plan), Design & Access Statement for Temporary Sales and Marketing Suite at St Bernard's Hospital Southall, and Heritage Statement prepared by Turley Heritage (dated March 2021).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | The use of the approved building shall be limited to Use Class E(c) for the express purpose of the marketing and sale of the development subject of planning permission P/2012/5040.",
    "Reason: The temporary use of the site for sales and marketing use is considered acceptable in order to realise the benefits of bringing forward the associated redevelopment of the wider site and should revert to the approved landscape scheme in order to protect and preserve the heritage asset when no longer required for this purpose. The limitation of the use ensures compliance with policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the NPPF (2021). | The proposed parking for vehicles and cycles as shown on plan ref: IA-388-LP-P01 Rev B shall be provided prior to the use of the approved development, and shall be retained through the life of the development.",
    "Reason: To ensure satisfactory parking arrangements for vehicles and cycles in accordance with policies T4, T5, T6 and T6.3 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 1.1 (g) of Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2026 (2012). | The rating noise level emitted from the external plant and machinery at the proposed development, as assessed under BS4142: 2014, will not exceed the existing background sound level, as measured at the nearest sensitive facades, during the relevant periods of operation.",
    "Reason: In the interest of the amenity of neighbouring residential properties, in accordance with policies D3, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policy 1.1 (j) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
