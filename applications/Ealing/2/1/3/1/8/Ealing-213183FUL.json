    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building and shall be consistent with those as listed within the submitted application form and the drawings / plans as listed in Condition (2).",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7B, policies 1.1 (h), 1.2 (g) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | Cycle storage for two (2) bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the site, within a secure, lockable compound in accordance with all adopted standards and be continuously available and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate bicycle storage to align with Sustainable Transport SPG and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | Refuse and recycling storage within an enclosure shall be provided within the curtilage of the site, in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards. These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",

    "Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10.  Details of best practicable mitigation measures for external amenity spaces shall also be provided and implemented, as necessary. Details shall confirm that noise limits specified in BS8233:2014 will not be exceeded. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPG10. | The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPG10. | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",

    "Reason: The local planning authority considers that further subdivision of the unit could cause detriment to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby properties and for this reason would wish to control any future development to comply with section 7 pf the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies D3, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021)."
