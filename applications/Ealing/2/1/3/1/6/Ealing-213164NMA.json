    "Prior to the commencement of works (excluding demolition, site clearance, and preparation works) on any phase or sub-phase (excluding Phases 1 and 2), a detailed surface water drainage scheme for each phase of the development shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval. The scheme shall be consistent with the approved Flood Risk Assessment (Rev 005, dated February 2015) and drawing 28075-C-SK-01 Rev P2.",
    "The surface water drainage scheme for each phase of the development (excluding Phases 1 and 2) shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details.",
    "The Surface Water Drainage Scheme implemented for Phase 1 shall be consistent with the details in document OCSC Report - Statement for the Discharge of Planning Condition 12 Relating to Surface Water Drainage Sherwood Close - Phase 1 dated 11th March 2016.",
    "The Surface Water Drainage Scheme implemented for Phase 2 shall be consistent with the details in document and OCSC report - Statement for the Discharge of Planning Condition 12 Relating to Surface Water Drainage Sherwood Close - Phase 2 dated March 2021.",
    "The detailed surface water drainage scheme shall include the following information:",
    "a) \tA clearly labelled drainage layout plan showing pipe networks and any attenuation areas or storage locations. This plan should show any pipe 'node numbers' that have been referred to in network calculations and it should also show invert and cover levels of manholes.",
    "b) \tConfirmation of the critical storm duration.",
    "c) \tWhere infiltration forms part of the proposed stormwater system such as infiltration trenches and soakaways, soakage test results and test locations are to be submitted in accordance with BRE digest 365.",
    "d) \tWhere on site attenuation is achieved through ponds, swales, geocellular storage or other similar methods, calculations showing the volume of these are also required.",
    "e) \tWhere an outfall discharge control device is to be used such as a hydrobrake or twin orifice, this should be shown on the plan with the rate of discharge stated.",
    "f) \tCalculations should demonstrate how the system operates during a 1 in 100 chance in any year critical duration storm event, including an allowance for climate change in line with the 'Planning Practice Guidance: Flood Risk and Coastal Change'. If overland flooding occurs in this event, a plan should also be submitted detailing the location of overland flow paths and the extent and depth of ponding.",
    "Reason:  To minimise the risk of flooding, to improve and protect water quality, improve habitat and amenity and in the interests of the drainage network in accordance with policies G6, SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), policy 1.2(m) of Ealing's Development (or Core) Strategy 2012; and policy 5.12 of Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013)."
