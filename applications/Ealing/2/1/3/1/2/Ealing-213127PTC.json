  "description": "This is a mature magnolia (Magnolia ? soulangeana) tree which is sadly in serious decline. After many years in superb bloom it had a very weak flowering and leaf growth in 2020 and is showing almost no signs of life this spring. While other local magnolias are in full bloom, just a single limb is showing buds and leaf growth (see photo). We have had several arborists / tree surgeons look at it over the last few months and none have been optimistic that it will recover. An infection is suspected, perhaps owing to driveway resurfacing works in 2016 that may have caused root damage. \n\nOn 6th April, an Alphagarden tree surgeon inspected the tree. He measured moisture in the trunk at 42%, which they say may be enough to support regrowth for a few seasons if dead wood is now cut back. He recommends cutting back dead wood across the canopy as far back as necessary, the extent of which will become clear when works are undertaken.\n\nWe are keen to try and save this tree even if the chances of success are not especially high.",
