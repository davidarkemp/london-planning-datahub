    "The proposed amendments cannot be accepted as a minor material amendments to planning permission Ref: 182600FUL dated 14/12/2018 (as amended by 200934VAR dated 30.09.2020), in accordance with Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for 'Minor material Amendments following grant of planning permission', on the following grounds:",
    "- The existing front elevation has a uniform appearance and an increase in the size of the lightwell at the front would cause an imbalance and disrupt the consistent appearance of the proposed building, particularly when viewed from Gunnersbury Avenue. This amendment would result in a materially detrimental impact on the visual amenity of the proposal, failing to comply with Ealing Council's Code of Practice for Minor Amendments to Planning Permissions.",
    "- The increase in the depth of the basement level, including the introduction of a 'balcony' to the rear elevation would result in significant additional site coverage in comparison to the originally approved scheme (182600FUL). It is noted that an extension to the existing approval was granted as part of ref: 200934VAR at a depth of 3 metres. This proposed amendment would increase the depth of the basement by a further 3 metres, therefore resulting in an additional 6 metres beyond the original approval. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Ealing Council's Code of Practice for Minor Amendments to Planning Permissions, as the proposal would result in a development that is materially larger in terms of scale in comparison to the original planning permission and would result in a significant increase in site coverage over and above what was originally approved.",
    "- The applicant is advised that should a new application be submitted under s73, please ensure that elevation plans are submitted as part of the application."
