    "The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its scale, design, mass, siting, and materiality would represent a dominant and incongruous form of development that would result in the overdevelopment of 42 Kingswood, to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 3.5, 7B, 7.4 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason its scale and siting along the boundary of 42 Kingswood Road (ground floor flat) and 44 Kingswood Road, would lead to undue harm to the amenity of neighbouring residents by reason of causing a sense of enclosure and an increase in overshadowing, contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its siting forward of the bay windows at no. 1 Bridgman Road, would lead to undue harm to the amenity of neighbouring residents by reason of causing a sense of enclosure and a loss of outlook, contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed dwellinghouse by reason of its single aspect nature would lead to a lack of outlook for future residents of the site, contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposal, by reason of its lack of accessible refuse and cycle provision, would lead to insufficient living conditions and provisions for sustainable transport, contrary to policies D3, D6, SI7, SI8 and T5 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed lack of private amenity space would harm the amenity of future residents of the site and fail to meet the requirements stated within Table 7D.2 of the Ealing Development DPD (2013)."
