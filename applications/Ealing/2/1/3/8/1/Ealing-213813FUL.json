    "The proposed crossover, by reason of its sitting, proximity to large street trees and obstructions within pedestrian visibility splays, would cause detrimental harm to highway and pedestrian safety. The excessive width would also cause harm to pedestrians and would create an unsafe and uncomfortable environment for vulnerable pedestrians. The siting and location of the two parking spaces within the front garden would also cause harm when entering and exiting the site as well as to pedestrians trying to gain access to the property. As such the proposal does not comply with Policy 6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 1.1 (f) of the Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The 3b4p unit on the upper floors is likely to be occupied by a family and does not have direct or convenient access to the (harmfully undersized) amenity space. There is also a lack of storage on the ground floor for items associated with this unit as to mitigate the siting on the upper floors. This would therefore cause harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers and would therefore be contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The separation of the rear garden into three independent plots would be harmfully out of keeping with the pattern of development for the surrounding area. This change would be readily visible from the surrounding dwellings and their garden areas and would unduly draw the eye. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
