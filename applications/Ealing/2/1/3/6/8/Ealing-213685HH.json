    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title numbers: 1185/P01; 1185/P02; 1185/1186/P03.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 7.4 & 7B of the Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 1.1 (g), 2.1 (c) and 2.10 of the Adopted Core Strategy (2012). | The outbuilding hereby permitted shall be used for domestic purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the main dwellinghouse at 60 Mornington Road, Greenford, Middlesex, UB6 9HL, only and not for any other use. No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed into the outbuilding at any time.",
