    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the drawings: Site Location Plan; SR/0421/PA1; SR/0421/PA2; SR/0421/PA3; SR/0421/PA4; SR/0421/PA5; SR/0421/PA6; SR/0421/PA7.",
    "REASON: For avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | A minimum of four cycle parking spaces shall be provided and located in a secure undercover lockable compound, prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained thereafter.",
    "REASON:  To provide adequate bicycle storage to align with Sustainable Transport SPG and policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | Refuse and recycling storage facilities as indicated on the hereby approved plans listed in condition 2 shall be implemented and operational before the first occupation of any part of the development, and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "REASON: In the interests of the adequate disposal, storage and collection of waste and recycling, in accordance with policies with policies 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed with regard to the Council's standard in the SPG10 and noise limits of BS8233:2014. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve criteria specified in BS8233:2014. The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "REASON: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy 7.15 of The London Plan (2015), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "REASON:   To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policies 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies and 7.15 of the London Plan (2016), the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration' . | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "REASON:  To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policies 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies and 7.15 of the London Plan (2016), the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'"
