    "The proposed amendments cannot be accepted as a minor material amendments to planning permission Ref: 182111FUL dated 26/06/2019, in accordance with Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for 'Minor material Amendments following grant of planning permission', on the following grounds:",
    "- The proposal would result in a change to the approved proposal description, which is not permitted by the Court of Appeal case, Finney vs Welsh Ministers, which does not allow for changes to proposal descriptions to approved developments under s73 applications.",
    "- The proposal would result in a significant change to the housing mix that was approved under 182111FUL, with the proposed changes resulting in a greater concentration of smaller units, in comparison to the approved scheme, which had a healthier mix of 1, 2 and 3 bedroom flats. Planning Permission will be required and a robust justification for the housing mix would need to be provided in accordance with Policy H10 of the London Plan.",
    "- The residential accommodation proposed results in an over-concentration of single aspect residential units, with many of the proposed units being north facing and single aspect. The supporting documentation does not provide any technicial assessments as to the quality of this proposed residential accommodation and the residential accommodation proposed would likely result in additional conditions with respect to noise, air quality, ventilation and overheating. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the objectives of Policy D6 of the London Plan, the Technical Housing Standards and the Mayor's Housing SPG."
