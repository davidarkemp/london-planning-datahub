    "The development as proposed would fail to provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation for future users of the site, owing to the undersized GIA of the first floor flat, and the lack of private amenity space. This is in conflict with policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Technical Housing Standards. | The development as proposed would cause detrimental harm to the neighbouring properties due to the overly large, unneighbourly, overbearing extensions and position of the first floor terrace that would cause loss of light and privacy. This is in conflict with policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).",
