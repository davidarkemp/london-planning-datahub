  "description": "(T1) Ash (Fraxinus excelsior)\nThe rear of this garden is dominated by a very large Ash tree in the adjacent garden. The Ash tree in the garden of number 13 is a self seeded tree.\nThis tree is growing very close to a brick structure and it has started to undermine the walls causing damage. It will continue to cause damage to this structure and should be removed.\nSuggested works; Fell to ground level by sectional takedown.\nRemove all arisings to a green waste recycling station.\n\n(T2) Cypress (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) \nThis tree has poor form and is of a very low amenity value. It is growing through a plum tree causing the crown to die back internally and the tips to spread too wide, creating poor form and a weak structure.\nSuggested works; Fell by sectional takedown.\nRemove all arisings to a green waste recycling station.\n\nPlum (Prunus astropurpurea)\nOnce the Cypress has been felled this tree can be pruned to regenerate internal growth and reshaped to improve form and enhance visual amenity value.\nReduced by 1-2 metres to create natural shape. Leaving 5+ metres.\n\n(T4) Holly (Ilex aquifolium) \nNo work required.",
