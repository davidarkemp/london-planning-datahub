    "The proposed first and second floor rear extension would introduce a poorly designed and ungainly addition to the exposed rear of the site that fails to provide visual relief when viewed in relation to the host property. The absence of subservience by way of set-back from the ornate corner detailing along Bideford Road; and the high parapet wall with expansive flat roof to the whole addition would cumulatively appear bulky and over-dominant, detrimental to the character and appearance of the local heritage asset and locality, in general. As such, the proposed would be contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan(2021); policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD(2013) and the NPPF(2019) | The proposed first and second floor rear extension would remove the existing dual aspect for two residential units and would obscure outlook for another 2 existing units with the building. The impact of this would be to decrease the existing quality of accommodation currently experienced by occupants. As such, this would be contrary to policy D6 and table 3.2 of the London Plan (2021) and local policies 7.4 and 7B of Ealing's Development Management DPD(2013) and the NPPF (2019) | In the absence of private amenity space for the new unit, and the provision of adequate secure cycle parking and demonstrative refuse storage facilities for the building, the proposal is considered to lack qualitative aspects necessary for a well-designed residential scheme. As such, the proposal fails to comply with policies D6 and table 3.2, T5 and table 10.2 of the London Plan (2021); and policies 7.4, 7B and 7D.2 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013)"
