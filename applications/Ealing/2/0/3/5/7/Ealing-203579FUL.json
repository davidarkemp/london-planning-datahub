    "The proposal by reason of its design, siting, scale, appearance, orientation and access would represent an inappropriate, ad-hoc, cramped and incongruous form of development that is out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development within the area to the detriment of surrounding amenity and character and that would set a harmful precedent for future development. As such, it is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposal by way of insufficient private amenity space, poor outlook and light provision and single aspect levels would provide cramped, substandard accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity. As such, it is contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposal by reason of its close proximity to two well-established trees protected by a Tree Preservation Order, most likely requiring their removal with no mitigation proposed, would result in harm to the amenity and character of the area. As such, it is contrary to policy 5.10 Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposal by reason of its lack of refuse and bicycle provision would provide insufficient facilities to the detriment of the amenity of future residents. As such, it is considered contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies SI7, SI8 and T5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposal by reason of not meeting the requirements of the Technical Housing Standards would provide insufficient living accommodation to the detriment of the amenity of future residents of the site contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
