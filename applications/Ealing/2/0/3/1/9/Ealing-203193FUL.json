    "The proposed re-development of the site for primarily residential use (Use Class C3), by reason of the substantial loss of industrial floorspace and the lack of re-provision of such floorspace in a more appropriate mix of uses through the 'Intensification, Co-Location and Substitution of Land for Industry, Logistics and Services' principles set out by policy E7 of the London Plan (2021), would be harmful to the long-term protection and sustainable economic development of industrial employment land and its associated Uses Classes within this designated and protected Locally Significant Industrial Site.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 1.2(b) and 3.3 of Ealing's Development Strategy DPD (2012); and policies E4, E6 and E7 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development, by reason of its design and the introduction of sensitive receptors (residential use) into a designated Locally Significant Industrial Site, would compromise the future development, intensification, continued efficient function and 24/7 operation of neighbouring industrial businesses.  In the absence of a design led or master plan approach and in the absence of sufficient evidence to the contrary, the proposal is therefore considered to result in harmful to the long-term protection and sustainable economic development of industrial employment land and its associated Uses Classes within this designated and protected Locally Significant Industrial Site, contrary to polices D13 and E7 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development would fail to meet the requirements of policy H5 'Threshold approach to applications' of the London Plan (2021), without following the Viability Tested Route that requires detailed supporting viability evidence to be submitted to the Council for the scrutinization of this viability information to ascertain the maximum level of affordable housing that can be provided by the development, to the detriment of a key strategic planning objective of delivering more genuinely affordable housing, making the most efficient use of available resources, and creating mixed and inclusive communities. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to policies H4, H6 and H10 of the London Plan (2021); 1.2 of the Development (Core) Strategy 2026 DPD (2012); and 3A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of its excessive scale, bulk and height, would result in a development that would not respect the local character or pattern and scale of development and would appear overbearing and over dominate, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, contrary to policy 1.2(h) of Ealing Development Strategy 2026 DPD (2012); Policy 7.4 and Policy 7B of the of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); Policies D3, D4, D8 and D9 of the London Plan (2021)."
