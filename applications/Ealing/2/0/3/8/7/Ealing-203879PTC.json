  "description": "I would like permission to remove two conifers that are planted next to each other. The trees are located to the right of 49 Birch Grove as you look at the property from the street. Note that there is a larger conifer in front of the two trees in question (i.e. closer to the road) and this tree will be unaffected by the works.\n\nOnce the two conifers are removed, I will replant a new deciduous tree on the same site.\n\nI would like to remove the two conifers because they have a lot of dead branches and they are quite unsightly. Also, replacement of these conifers with a deciduous tree (probably a type of birch) will be much more in-keeping with the general look of the road, which is lined with birch trees.",
