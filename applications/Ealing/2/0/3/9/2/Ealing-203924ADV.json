    "The proposed digital advertisement display and supporting structure, by reason of its location, profile and size, would result in the introduction of an overly prominent and visually obtrusive structure to the detriment of the visual amenity provided by the openness of the designated Green Corridors within which the appeal site is located. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to policies D4, D8 and G1 of the London Plan (2021); 3.1 and 5.3 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012); and 2.18, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed digital advertisement display and supporting structure, by reason of its location, profile and size, would result in the introduction of a visual impediment to directional signage on the adjacent highway and distraction for motorists in a location where a serious collision has already occurred to the detriment of highway safety and the smooth operation of the Transport for London Road Network. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to policies T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021)."
