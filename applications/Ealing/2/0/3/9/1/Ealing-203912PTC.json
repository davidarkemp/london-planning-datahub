Take extra care not to lose any of the screen value provided by the lower crown.\n\n- Lift low hanging branches over the rear garden to a height of 4 metres to allow more light into the property. \n\n- Remove all deadwood. \n\n- Thin crown by approx. 10%.\n\n- Reduce crown by approx. 2 metres whilst retaining as much furnishing growth as possible. \n\nExtra care is to be taken with this tree to ensure the natural shape is not compromised whilst containing it within the garden.",
