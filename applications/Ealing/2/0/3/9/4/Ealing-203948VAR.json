    "The siting of the new driveway would cause harm in terms of highway safety. Cars could not enter and exit the proposed driveway/ site in a forward gear. The driveway would also be opposite the junction of Sandringham Road which would inhibit safety. It is also on a bus route and the visibility splays could be partially obscured by the existing tree and streetlight. The scheme would therefore cause harm in terms of highway safety and would be contrary to Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021. | The proposed siting of the driveway would obstruct passage to the rear gardens in terms of usability of the rear amenity space. It would also inhibit moving refuse bins to and from the front of the site as these would now be located in the rear gardens. The refuse bins located in the further rear garden would also be a significant distance from the road. The new siting would therefore not be located in an easy and accessible space. This would therefore cause harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers and is contrary to Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
