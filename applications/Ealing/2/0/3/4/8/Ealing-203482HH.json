    "The proposed crossover, by reason of the inadequate depth and width of the forecourt which is an inadequate size to allow a vehicle to enter and exit the site in a forward gear and its location within close proximity to an existing junction, would result in an access arrangement that would be detrimental to highway safety and likely to result in a danger to highway users. As such, the proposed development would fail to adhere to the Council's Vehicle Crossovers: Application Pack for Residents (2016), Policy 6.3 of the London Plan (2016) and policy 1.1 of the Ealing Local Development Framework - Adopted (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposal would result in the net loss of multiple parking spaces, which would exacerbate car parking stress within the controlled parking zone, to the detriment of the amenity of existing residents in the area and to highway safety, contrary to policies 6.3 of the London Plan (2016), policy 1.1 (f) of the Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
