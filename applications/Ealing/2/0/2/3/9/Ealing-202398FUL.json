    "The proposed taxi-drop off layby, by reason of the vehicle crossovers required and their proximity to two junctions, would result in an increase in the number of vehicles crossing the path of pedestrians and cyclists within 10.0m of two junctions along a stretch of Uxbridge Road prone to collisions resulting in injuries and, subsequently, increase the potential for conflict between vehicles and vulnerable highway users to the detriment of highway safety. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to Policy 6.3 of the London Plan (2016). | The proposed taxi drop-off layby, by reason of the removal of two trees and reduction in pedestrian/public space, would result in a less attractive streetscape and increase the dominance of the motor vehicle to the detriment of the quality of the public realm, visual amenity, and use of active modes of transport.  As such, the proposal is considered contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Ealing's Transport Strategy (2019), as well as, policies 6.9, and 6.10 of the London Plan (2016); T2 of Draft London Plan (2019); and 7B, 7.4 and 7.5 of the Development Management DPD (2013)."
