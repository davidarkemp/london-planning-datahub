  "description": "T1-Plum\nRaise crown over lawn by 1-2m and reduce lateral spread over lawn by 1-2m from branch tips in order to provide more clearance.\n\nT2-Oak\nLarge mature tree with a wide-spreading and full crown. \nPrevious history of a large scaffold limb failure over the neighbouring property. \n\nSuggested works are to selectively reduce the protruding lateral spread over the garden (Western side only) by 2-3m from branch tips \nand back into the main canopy outline.\nThin crown by 10% ensuring an even distribution of internal foliage.\nRemove all large diameter dead branches and the large stub on the lower Northern side.\n\nThe reasons for these works are to contain the spread of the tree avoiding the need for larger diameter pruning cuts in the future, the aim is not for a full crown reduction at all.\n\nT3- Horse Chestnut\nIvy clad on the main trunk and scaffold. \nLateral spread encroaching on the building and overhanging guttering.\nClose proximity to the house and outgrowing location. \n\nSuggested works are to reduce the crown by 3m in height and 2-3m laterally from branch tips.\n(Or as much as allowed my local planning authority)\n\nShear Ivy back to main trunk and thin lightly by 10%.\n\nThe reasons for these works are to contain the growth of the tree and maintain it relative to its surroundings as it is beginning to cause issues with the property.",
