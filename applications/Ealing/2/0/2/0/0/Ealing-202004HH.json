As such, it would fail to comply with section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan, policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area Management Plan (2008)."
