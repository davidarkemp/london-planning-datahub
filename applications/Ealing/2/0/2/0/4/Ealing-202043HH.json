    "The proposed rear roof extension given its siting, size and scale constitutes an over dominant and obtrusive form of development which detracts from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and harms the visual amenities of surrounding occupants. As such the proposed development would be contrary to Policy D2 of the Draft New London Plan 2018, Policy 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), National Planning Policy Framework 2019 - Section 12 - Achieving well-designed places, Supplementary Planning Document 4 - Residential Extensions",
    "| The proposed rear roof extension, by reason of its height, depth and location would result in an imposing and overbearing development that would lead to an increased sense of enclosure to the adjoining property at 27 Brassie Road, and additionally due to its rearward facing windows, a loss of privacy to no. 27 Brassie Road, contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
