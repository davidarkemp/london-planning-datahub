    "The proposed development by reason of its scale would result in an addition to the original property that is incongruous with the pattern of development in this location to the detriment of the character of the area and architectural integrity of the original dwelling. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), and Interim Planning Guidance SPD4. | The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly development on No. 196 Greenford Avenue, by way of being overbearing and increased sense of enclosure.  As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal, contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
