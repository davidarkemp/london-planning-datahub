    "The proposed development by reason of its design, appearance, roof profiles, scale and bulk would result in an incongruous and visually disjointed development that would be overbearing and harmful to the architectural integrity of the original building, the visual amenity of the street scene and the character of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies 7.4, 7.6 of the London Plan (2016). | The proposed rear extension by reason of its design, height, scale, bulk, roof profiles and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly development on the upper floors of Nos. 211 and 217 The Broadway, by way of being overbearing and causing an increased sense of enclosure.  As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at these neighbouring properties would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal, contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
