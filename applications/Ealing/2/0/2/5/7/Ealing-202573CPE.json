Additionally, the proposed alterations are ineligible for a Lawful Development Certificate sought through Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended by Section 10 of the Planning & Compensation Act 1991). Therefore, it is recommended that a Lawful Development Certificate be REFUSED."
