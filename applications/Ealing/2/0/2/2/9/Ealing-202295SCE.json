    "The proposed development falls outside of the definition of 'Schedule 2 Development' as this 'Urban Development Project' proposes less than 150 dwellings and is not located within a 'sensitive area' defined within the EIA Regulations (as amended). | On this basis the Local Planning Authority is of the opinion that the proposed development will not likely have significant effects on the environment as interpreted by the EIA Regulations (as amended). Therefore, the proposal does not constitute EIA development requiring an Environmental Statement. This is not to say that the proposed development will not have environmental effects of a localised nature which will need to be considered in determining any planning application."
