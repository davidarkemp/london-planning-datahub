    "The principle of further intensification of the use of the outbuilding for residential uses and employee facilities would likely lead to increase noise and disturbance to adjoining properties, to the detriment of the residential amenity of the occupants of neighbouring properties, particularly nos. 24A, 24B and 27 Villiers Road, Southall. The intensification of the use would also fail to be consistent with the prevailing pattern of development, to the detriment of the character of the surrounding area. As such, it is considered that the proposal would fail to comply with Policies 7A, 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan. | The proposed care home rooms would be physically isolated from the facilities, such as the kitchen, of the main building, resulting in a poor quality living environment, to the detriment of the living conditions for future residents. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy 3.5 of the London Plan, Technical Housing Standards and the Mayor's Housing SPG."
