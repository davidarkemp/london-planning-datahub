    "The proposed extensions and changes by virtue of its scale and depth would be out of keeping and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area, and its character and appearance, contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposed development, by reason of the number of units and people living on the site, the size and layout of the rooms as well as the inadequate GIA would provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers and the surrounding area. The use of the communal garden by the proposed occupiers would also lead to a significantly harmful increase in overlooking/ loss of privacy to the future occupiers. The proposed works are therefore contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2018)."
