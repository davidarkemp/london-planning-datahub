As such the proposal would be unacceptable  in terms of its design quality and contrary to policy 7.4 of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013 and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016.",
    "| Due to the excessive depth of the proposal along a shared boundary in close proximity to the fenestration of the adjoining property the proposal would result in a loss of outlook to the adjoining neighbour and would result in an unneighbourly sense of enclosure. As such the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of neighbour amenity considerations and contrary to policy 7B of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013."
