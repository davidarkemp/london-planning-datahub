    "The subdivision of the unit to create a car workshop and the provision of the sale of tyres and wheels, by reason of its use and siting, would be inconsistent with the site's designation as a Strategic Industrial Location and would remove the servicing yard of the warehouse which would compromise the ability of the warehouse to return to its lawful use. This would have a detrimental impact on the functionality and operability of the SIL. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies E4 and E5 of the London Plan."
