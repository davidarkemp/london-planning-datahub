  "description": "Large lime tree (T1) in front garden (TPO in place TPO/2019/1112) - prune back to previous reduction points (approx 2m) and remove deadwood (see photograph 1 & 2). The size of tree and closeness to the house is also causing excessive shading. \nThe health and amenity value of the tree will be improved with some management. \n\nTwo sycamores in rear garden (T2 and T3) fell to ground. Earlier tree removal work in 2019 has allowed a better view of these two trees. T2 has been severely abraded on the trunk by a now removed tree (see photographs 6 & 7). This has left the trunk weak. The other sycamore (T3) is self sown and is growing at a 45 degree angle (see photograph 8). It is our intention to replace these two trees with suitable garden trees (e.g. cherry, silver birch and magnolia) with better amenity value. This will also allow improved privacy for ourselves and our neighbours.",
