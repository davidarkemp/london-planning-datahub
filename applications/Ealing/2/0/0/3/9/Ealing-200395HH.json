    "Given the size, scale and height of the proposed structure and that this would be located in a plot of limited size/ proportion, the proposed change would represent an overdevelopment of the plot that does not appear suitably subordinate in scale or use to the main dwelling. The proposed change would also be readily visible from the adjacent footpaths and roads, and neighbouring properties and does not draw sufficient reference from the character and appearance of the site or surrounding area. The new structure would be an incongruous and discordant feature and the proposed design, size, bulk and massing would cause significant harm to the visual amenity of the street scene and the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area and would be contrary to policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan, and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposed development, by virtue of its siting and height would cause a significantly harmful sense of enclosure to number 155 Trinity Road. It is therefore an unneighbourly form of development and would be contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016."
