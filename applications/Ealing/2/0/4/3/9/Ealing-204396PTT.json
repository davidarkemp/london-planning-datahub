  "description": "I believe it is a sycamore tree - it is on Network Rail land very close to the garden fence of 82 and 84 Felix Road. The properties have complained that the tree is overgrown, overhanging their boundary, covering their garden in winged seeds. The tree is getting close to touching the properties roofs and gutters and the resident at number 82 has slipped in her garden due to the fallen leaves and seeds. The resident is extremely upset and stressed due to the tree therefore I am seeking permission for contractors on behalf of Network Rail to reduce the crown of the tree by no more than 30% so that it no longer overhangs the gardens of our neighbours.",
