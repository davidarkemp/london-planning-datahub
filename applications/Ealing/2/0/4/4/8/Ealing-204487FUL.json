    "The proposed extension, by reason of its design, depth, siting and scale would be an incongruous form of development that would fail to be subordinate to the host dwelling or consistent with the prevailing pattern of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the objectives of policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposed development by reason of poor outlook and daylight/sunlight provision as well as insufficient internal floor areas and privacy/nuisance issues would result in a substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), The Technical Housing Standards and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The application fails to demonstrate that the use of the second floor of no. 77 would not be sensitive to the siting and scale of the proposed extension which would result in a significantly increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. It has also not been demonstrated that nos. 71-73 The Broadway would not be unduly impacted by way of a loss of light and outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
