    "The ground investigation report shall determine infiltration rates, water table level, etc. and all other appropriate investigation to confirm the development would not adversely affect ground water flow paths. Consideration shall be given to compensate loss of storage within the ground and appropriate mitigation measures shall be implemented.",
    "Approved details shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development and permanently retained and maintained.",
    "Reason: To reduce surface water run-off and the risk of the flooding of the application property, neighbouring properties, and local area in accordance with policy 5.12 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy), policies 5.12 and 5.13 of the London Plan (2016), policies D10, SI 12 and SI 13 of the Publication London Plan (2020) and the NPPF (2019)."
