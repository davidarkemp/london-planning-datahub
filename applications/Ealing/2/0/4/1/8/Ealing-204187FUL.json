    "The existing single storey rear extension and outbuilding, and proposed two storey rear extension by reason of its design, bulk, scale and appearance would result in incongruous additions to the original property which would be to the detriment of the character of the area and the visual amenity of the street scene. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), and Interim Planning Guidance SPD4. | The proposed development by reason of insufficient internal floor areas would result in a substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); policy D6 of the London Plan (2021); the GLA Housing SPG; Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015); and Section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposed two storey rear extension by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly development on No. 5 Kings Avenue, by way of being overbearing and increased sense of enclosure.  As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal, contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed parking arrangement and its excessive crossover width would result in an access arrangement that would be detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety and likely to result in a danger to highway users. As such, it is considered that the proposal would be contrary to Policy T4 and of the London Plan (2021) and 1.1 of the Local Development Framework (Core) Strategy (2012)."
