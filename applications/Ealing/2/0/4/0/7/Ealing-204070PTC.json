  "description": "Rear Garden East Boundary with hotel\nT1\toak x 1\tFell Extra Large 16m dead Oak tree to ground level.  We will need to hire in a 26m MEWP to safely carry out this work. \n\tThis tree has a high wildlife potential. Therefore a MEWP would be prudent as the trunk will need to be cut down in narrow 4-6\" rings checking each cavity.\nRear Garden East Boundary with hotel\nT2\tSycamore x 2(Acer pseudoplatanus). This tree is located in the South Eastern corner of the garden. Our client has requested we reduce this tree by approx. 40% this equates to a reduction in height of approx. 2-3m and a reduction 2-3m of the laterals branches to shape, Remove all deadwood throughout the crown. No lift required as the residents want to maintain a screen.",
