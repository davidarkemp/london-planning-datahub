    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Details of the materials and finishes to be used for all external surfaces (including hardstanding and boundary treatments) of the development hereby approved shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority before the superstructure of the development is commenced and this condition shall apply notwithstanding any indications as to these matters which have been given in this application. The development shall be implemented only in accordance with these approved details.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials and finishes are of high quality and contribute positively to the visual amenity of the locality in accordance with policies 1.1 (h) (g), 1.2(h), 2.1(c) and 2.10 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies ELV 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | Notwithstanding the provisions of Classes A - F of Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (or any subsequent amendment to that order) no outbuildings, extensions or alterations shall be carried out at the dwellinghouse hereby approved without the prior permission of the local planning authority obtained through the submission of a planning application.",
