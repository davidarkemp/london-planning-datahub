  "description": "Two storey rear extension (first and second floor level) above existing ground floor office to accommodate four HMO rooms; installation of rear access staircase",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed HMO development, by reason of its internal layout and by providing rooms that are extremely narrow in width (Units 1 and 3 located in the proposed extension) would constitute a substandard and unsustainable form of development that would provide poor quality living conditions for future residents. There would also be insufficient provision of cycle parking and refuse area related with the proposed creation of HMO units. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), the Technical Housing Standards, Council's HMO Licensing requirements and the Mayor's Housing SPG. It would also be contrary to Policy T5 of the Publication London Plan (2020) | The proposed two-storey rear extension would be readily visible from the adjacent footpaths and roads and surrounding buildings. Its excessive depth and overall design means that it would become one of the largest projections and which does not draw sufficient reference from the character and appearance of the site or surrounding area. It would be an incongruous and discordant feature. The proposed design, size, bulk and massing would therefore cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area and would be contrary to policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposed development, by virtue of the siting of the new terrace on the first floor in relation to the surrounding properties would give rise to direct overlooking of the neighbouring buildings and beyond. There would also be a harmful increase in elements such as noise caused through the use of this space. As such, the proposal is contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016."
