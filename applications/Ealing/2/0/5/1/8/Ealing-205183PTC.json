  "description": "There are 7 various shrubs/trees (1 Laurel, 1 Birch, 2 Choisya, 1 Pittosboreum, 2 Photinia) to be removed and stump ground in the properties garden, to make way for more attractive replanting; providing additional screening for the homeowner. The homeowner plans to replant a variety of pleached trees instead. There are no specific TPO reference numbers for these, nor for the conservation area they fall in. However I have attached a screen grab of their location on the Ealing planning map.  \nThere is also and 1 Pittosboreum to be reduced, this will aid in its maintenance. The proposed work will reduce the trees height from approximately 15ft to 9ft and the width from 12ft to 8ft.",
