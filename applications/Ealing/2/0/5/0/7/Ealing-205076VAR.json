Variation seeks part infill of first floor recess by extending ground floor diagonal wall upwards and amending roof to suit.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed amendments cannot be accepted as a minor material amendment to planning permission ref. 203483FUL dated 29/10/2020 in accordance with S73 of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for Minor Material Amendments following grant of planning permission (2015) as the changes to the approved dwelling on this prominent corner plot would result in a design, scale and bulk that would be materially detrimental to the architectural integrity of the approved development and the visual amenity of the street scene. The proposed amendment would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of London Plan (2016); D4 of the Publication London Plan (2020) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013)."
