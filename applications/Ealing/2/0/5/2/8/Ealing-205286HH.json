Access shall only be provided through the house, as detailed in the approved drawing reference 637.01/PL02.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan, Policies 1.1 and 1.2 of Ealing's Development Strategy and Policies 7.4 and 7B of Ealing's Development Management DPD."
