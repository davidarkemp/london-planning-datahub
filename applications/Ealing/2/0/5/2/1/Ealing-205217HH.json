  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk, width, unsympathetic design, roof profile, materials, fenestration and detailing, would represent an overbearing and illogical addition to the host dwelling that would engulf the rear elevation of the dwelling, would be at odds with the traditional setting, and would potentially harm existing trees of special value, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the street scene, the wider Conservation Area, and the visual amenities of neighbouring sites. The development would therefore run contrary to the NPPF (2019), the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), policies D4, D6, HC1 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 and Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area Management Plan."
