    "The proposed HMO development, by reason of it containing 8 self-contained dwelling units with their own kitchens and bathrooms, would not constitute a House in Multiple Occupation. The proposed units would also not meet national space standards for self-contained one bedroom flats.  The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), the Technical Housing Standards, Council's HMO Licensing requirements and the Mayor's Housing SPG.",
    "| The proposed rear extensions due to their scale and design are considered out of keeping with the original building and harmful to the character of the area contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD, and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework. | The proposed first floor rear extension due to its siting, size and closeness to neighbouring properties appear likely to have a harmful effect on the residential amenity presently enjoyed by adjoining occupiers by reason of overlooking, loss of light, and loss of outlook and enclosure effects on rear and flank wall windows. As such the proposal is considered to be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, policies 1.1 (g) (h), 1.2 (h) and 4.1 (d) of the adopted Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and policies ELV 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013)."
