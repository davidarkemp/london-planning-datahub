  "decision_conditions": [
    "The use of the property as self-contained flats shall cease within 3 months of the date of this Decision Notice, failing which this permission will lapse and will be of no force and effect. The HMO use hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and the Enforcement Notice over the site (EN180795ODOB). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings and documents:",
    "445/01 (Existing Ground and First Floor Plans); 445/02 (Existing Loft and Roof Plans); 445/03 (Existing North and South Elevations); 445/08 (Proposed Ground and First Floor Plans); 445/09 (Proposed Loft and Roof Plans); 445/10 (Proposed North and South Elevations); 445/11 (Existing and Proposed East Elevation); Planning Statement (March 2022)",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021). | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policy D14 of the London Plan. | The sound insulation of the floor/ceiling /wall structures separating different types of rooms/ uses, namely, bedrooms adjoining/below/above communal main entrance or kitchen/ living/ dining/ bathroom shall be enhanced by at least 5dB above the recommended Building Regulations value. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021). | Notwithstanding the approved plans, refuse/recycling storage shall be provided in accordance with Council policies and brought into use prior to the occupation of the HMO use.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, to protect amenity of the area and in the interests of the future occupants of the development in accordance with policies with policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan 2013, policy 1.1(e) of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and Council's Waste Management Guidelines | Cycle storage for 10 bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the development, within secure, lockable compounds in accordance with the designated locations identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and all adopted standards prior to the first occupation of the building. The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate bicycle storage in accordance with policy and T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The existing outbuilding shall be used only for domestic purposes incidental to the HMO use of the site for storage and cycle parking as outlined on the approved plans. The outbuilding shall not be used for separate habitable accommodation, letting or any commercial use. No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed at any time.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | No cooking facilities shall be installed at any time in any of the rooms. All cooking and preparation of hot food shall take place within the communal kitchens identified on the approved plans.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the HMO rooms are not wholly self-contained and to protect the amenity of the occupants of each of the rooms and neighbouring properties, in accordance with Policy D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Council HMO Licensing Guidelines."
