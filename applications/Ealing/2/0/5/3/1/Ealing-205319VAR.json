Variation seeks to enlarge the size of the 1st floor side extension to the front and side in order to increase the GIA of Flat 2 to 71sqm.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed amendments cannot be accepted as a minor material amendment to planning permission ref. 203841FUL dated 27/11/2020 in accordance with S73 of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for Minor Material Amendments following grant of planning permission (2020) as the changes to the approved permission would result in a design that would be materially detrimental to the architectural integrity of the approved development and the visual amenity of the street scene. The proposed amendment would therefore be contrary to policies D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013)."
