    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "REASON: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",

    "REASON: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building and shall be consistent with those listed within the submitted application form and the drawings / plans as listed in Condition (2).",

No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed into the outbuilding at any time.",
