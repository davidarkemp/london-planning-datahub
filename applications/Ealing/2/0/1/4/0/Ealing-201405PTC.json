  "description": "T1 & T2 - Blue Atlas Cedar - Crown lift to 3m where the branches overhang public pavement and pathway. 30% Crown reduction as the trees:\n1) are positioned by our front wall and have damaged both the paving around it and the front wall. The paving is lifted in areas and there are large, deep cracks in our front wall. We have been advised that we will need to replace the wall if the tree is not removed. It is currently leaning forward and at some point if unchecked could become a hazard to pedestrians: During high winds overnight a couple of months ago some large branches fell off. \n2) are covering and overshadowing the house and blocking sunlight to the house. Looking at the house from the road you see more tree than house and when you look from the house the trees block the view of the road/common.\n3) droppings are acidic and kill our plants, especially the rose bushes which line our pathway",
