    "The proposed development by reason of its design, scale, bulk, prominence and roof forms would represent an incongruous and visually obtrusive form of development which fails to respect the architectural integrity of the original dwellinghouse, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the street scene and the character of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the high quality design aspirations of section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2018), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), and Interim Planning Guidance SPD4. | The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly development on No. 48 Harewood Avenue, by way of being overbearing and increased sense of enclosure.  As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal, contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
