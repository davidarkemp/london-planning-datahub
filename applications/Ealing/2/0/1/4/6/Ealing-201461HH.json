    "The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension, by reason of its design and scale would appear as an incongruous and visually prominent addition poorly related to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension by reason of its scale and distance to the boundary bulk would in an increased sense of enclosure to the neighbour at No. 19 Rusthall Avenue. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly impacted upon by the development. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
