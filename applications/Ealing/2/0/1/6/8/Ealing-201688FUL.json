    "The proposed residential development, by virtue of its design, location, form, limited size of plot and relationship with its context would result in a cramped form of overdevelopment that would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area and visual amenity of the street scene. It would be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 3.5, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposed development, by virtue of its height and siting in relation to the surrounding properties would cause a significantly harmful impact to the living conditions and garden areas of the surrounding dwellings. There could also be a harmful increase in overlooking to the adjacent properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016."
