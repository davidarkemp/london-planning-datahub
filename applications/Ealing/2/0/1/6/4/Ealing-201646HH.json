    "The proposed development by reason of design, scale, bulk and roof profiles would represent an excessive and obtrusive addition that would adversely affect the architectural integrity of the original dwelling, and would not preserve and enhance the character of the conservation area, and the proposed development by reason of design, siting, scale and bulk would result in an unneighbourly and overbearing development upon No. 39 Green Lane.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016); policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); St Marks Church and Canal Conservation Area Management Plan; and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
