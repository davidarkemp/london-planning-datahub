    "The proposed part single-storey, part-two storey rear extension, by reason of the depth of its ground floor component and scale of the whole extension, would result in an overdevelopment of the dwellinghouse that would appear insubordinate to the original building, as well as, out of keeping with scale and pattern of development in the immediate area to the detriment of its character and appearance. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019); and 5.0 of Ealing's Supplementary Planning Document 4 - Residential Extensions, as well as, policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016); 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012); and 7B, and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
