As such, the proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling and Conservation Area and runs contrary to section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), policies 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 and Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area Management Plan."
