    "The proposed development, by reason of encouraging private motor vehicle use, would represent an unsustainable form of development. The principle of development is therefore not accepted and would be contrary to Ealing Council and the Mayor of London's strategic objectives of increasing all trips within London by foot, cycle or public transport, particularly given the high PTAL rating of the application site. The proposed development is also significantly lacking in any justification for the proposed development and no transport assessment has been carried out, and therefore the proposal is likely to increase trip generation within local roads, to the detriment of transport capacity and the free flow of traffic within the Borough. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policies T1, T3, T4 and T6 of the London Plan.",
    "| The proposed car park, by reason of its siting in close proximity to residential properties on Greenford Road, would constitute a incongruous and discordant form of development, increasing noise, vibration, spillage of light and fumes and resulting in detrimental impacts on neighbours, to the detriment of the acoustic environment, local air quality and the living conditions of the occupants of surrounding residential properties. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policies GG3 and SI1 of the London Plan."
