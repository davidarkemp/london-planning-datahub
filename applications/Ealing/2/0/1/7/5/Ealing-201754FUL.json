As such, it is contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), policies 1.1 (g) and 2.1 (c) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies 3.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016). | The proposal by reason of insufficient internal floor area and amenity space as well as privacy/nuisance issues would provide substandard accommodation for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity.
