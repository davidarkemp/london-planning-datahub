    "The proposed single storey rear/side extension, by reason of its depth, width and volume, would result in an overdevelopment of the original dwellinghouse that would appear insubordinate and out of keeping with the local pattern and scale of development. Furthermore, the roof of the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse, by reason of its profile and design, would appear overbearing and incongruous with original dwellinghouse to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property.  As such, the proposed development would run contrary to policies 7.1, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4 - Residential Extensions."
