    "The proposed residential dwelling, by reason of its siting and design, would represent a cramped and incongruous form of development within its limited plot that is not of a sufficient size to successfully accommodate a new dwelling, resulting in a development that would be wholly out of character with the prevailing pattern and grain of development and incompatible within the surrounding townscape.   As such, the proposal would be contrary to polices GG2, D1, D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and Section 12 of the NPPF (2021). | The proposed residential dwelling, by reason of its inappropriate siting; contrived layout; the inclusion of cycle storage within the dwelling; lack of private amenity space; insufficient outlook; and inappropriate access and refuse/ recycling arrangement, would cumulatively result in an insecure and substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of potential future occupiers of the dwelling.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D4, D5, D6, D11 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), policy 3.5, 7.3, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and the London Housing SPG (Updated 2017)."
