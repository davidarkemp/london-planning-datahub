  "description": "The trees are in narrow back garden of Brentham terraced house adjacent to the border of numbers 23 and 24 (however just in the garden of number 23)\n\n1. Mature hawthorn tree. Height approximately 10 metre at 7 metre from back of house. Proposed work : reduce crown by approximately 2 metre in height, thin canopy by 15%, raise canopy to 2 metre. Shape canopy in accordance with good practice. \n\n2. Mature apple tree. Next to hawthorn. Height approximately 7 metre at 9 metres from house. Proposed work ; reduce crown by approximately 2 metre in height, thin canopy by 15%, raise canopy to 2 metre. Shape canopy in accordance with good practice.\n\nThese two trees are on the border of our house's garden and that of number 24. The owner of number 24 has complained that the trees are taking his light and has asked me to reduce the height. The owner has also raised a potential risk of causing subsidence to our properties, citing a mature oak tree that did cause subsidence in our property a number of years ago . (After extensive monitoring and investigation this oak was ultimately felled following the advice of insurance company surveyors and appropriate planning permission. This was about twice as far from the houses but much larger than these trees.)\n\n\n\n\n(Bay tree - height approximately 6 metres, at 5 metres from house. Reduce crown by 2 metres. This tree however is only 6.5cm at 1.5metres from the ground and therefore does not need planning permission as I understand it,  being below the 7.5cm limit requiring notification. I would aim however to have it pruned at the same time.)\n\nThis work would be carried out professionally. It would be done in late autumn, to avoid the bird nesting season and to minimise trauma to the tree. This is my understanding of best practice, but I would be open to advice on these matters.\n\nPlease note, the height measurements above are estimates as I cannot measure the heights directly.\n\nPlease note that is all but impossible to photograph these tr...",
