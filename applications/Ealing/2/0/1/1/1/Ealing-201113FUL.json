The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), the St. Marks and Canal Conservation Area Management Plan (2007) and St. Marks and Canal Conservation Area Appraisal (2007)."
