    "The proposed four-storey building by reason of its design, scale and massing would appear as an overbearing and visually intrusive addition that would be at odds with the built character of the immediate commercial vicinity and the context of the residential properties to the north, as well as being likely to serve prejudice on adjoining sites in terms of overlooking. As such the proposal is contrary to policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), the London Plan Supplementary Planning Guidance and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012)."
