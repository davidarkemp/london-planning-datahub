    "The proposed increase to the height of the ridgeline of the terraced house due to its height and design would fail to appear harmonious with the row of dwellings and would constitute an addition that would be harmful to the character of the street scene and visual amenities of the area.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021)."
