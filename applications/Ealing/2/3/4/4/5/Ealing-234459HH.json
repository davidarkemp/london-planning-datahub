    "The proposed side and rear extensions and roof extensions, by reason of their height, bulk, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character of the area and general pattern of area as well as the case detrimental impact to the visual amenity of the street scene. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the Brunswick Conservation Area Management Plan. | The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, height, fenestrational detail, and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would appear overdominant and overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties, and would result in creation of enclosure and loss of outlook to those properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The submitted information is missing the essential heritage statement, Tree survey/Arboricultural statement and fenestration details of the proposed windows to determine its acceptability. The Council is therefore unable to fully assess the proposed development and in the absence of accurate and consistent details it is considered that the proposed development would be inconsistent with the objectives of policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy G7 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
