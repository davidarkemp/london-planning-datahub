    "The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its scale, bulk, design and siting within the rear garden of 225 Western Road would represent a dominant and incongruous form of development that would result in the overdevelopment of this site and reduce the spaciousness of the Manor Way streetscene, to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the wider area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 3.5, 7B, 7.4 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
