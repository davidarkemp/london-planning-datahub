    "The proposed converted flats (Flat 1 and Flat 2) by reason of its cramped layout, no daylighting to the poor-quality cramped kitchen, fail to meet the minimum size requirements, insufficient space for living room/kitchen and dining room would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation, with inadequate head height, natural light, ventilation and privacy, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. The proposal would therefore fail to comply policies D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 3.5,7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Nationally Described Space Standards and Housing Design Standards LPG (2023)."
