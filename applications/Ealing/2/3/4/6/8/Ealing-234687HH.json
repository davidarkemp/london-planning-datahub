    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its height, width, bulk and siting, would constitute an overbearing, unsympathetic and un-neighbourly form of development that would result in a harmful loss of sunlight/daylight and outlook to 8 Oldfield Farm Gardens, to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
