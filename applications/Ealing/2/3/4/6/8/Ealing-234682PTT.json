    "The replacement trees must be planted on or near the existing tree by April 2025; the tree should, as recommended, Golden elm (Ulmus hollandica 'Wredei') to replace T5 - Lime (Tilia spp.) and x2 Yew (Taxus baccata) to replace the T7 & T9 Hollys (Ilex spp.) and of a size not less than 10-12cm girth when planted.",
    "Reason: To ensure the continued amenity provided by the tree(s) and the planting of an appropriate species and in order to preserve the character and appearance of this part of Ealing Green conservation area. | The tree work specified above must be carried out within 2 years of the date of this decision.",
    "Reason: To ensure the work is only carried out once in respect of this consent and allow Ealing Council the opportunity to reconsider its decision in the light of prevailing circumstances, and reconsult on the case in the event of the consent expiring before implementation."
