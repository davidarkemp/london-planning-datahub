    "The proposed development, by reason of its overall design, the forward projection of the side extension and cumulative impact of all proposed extensions, would fail to be a subordinate addition to the host dwelling and would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, to the detriment of the character, appearance and general pattern of development of the surrounding area. The proposed development would accordingly fail to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
