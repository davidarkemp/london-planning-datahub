    "By way of its scale and siting, the proposed front porch extension's excessive depth, width and height would constitute as a disproportionate addition to the parent property, failing to appear subservient in comparison, unbalancing the front elevation and as such, would cause a detrimental impact to the appearance of the application site within the street scene.",
    "Therefore, given the above, it is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its scale and design and fails to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
