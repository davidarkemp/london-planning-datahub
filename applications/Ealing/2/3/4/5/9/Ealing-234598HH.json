    "The proposed single storey side extension, by reason of its location, design, width, depth, mass, bulk, and height, would result in an incongruous and contrived form of development, that would be at odds with the surrounding area, to the detriment of local character and appearance. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18)."
