    "a)\tWritten notification shall be provided to the Local Planning Authority at least 21 days prior to the implementation of the approved Energy Statement prepared by Cudd Bentley Consulting Ltd dated July 2020. Until such time, six monthly updates on the grid capacity status shall be provided to the Council starting on July 1st 2024.",
    "b)\tFollowing notification under Condition 25 part a) the development shall be implemented  in accordance with the Energy Statement prepared by Cudd Bentley Consulting Ltd dated July 2020 including the approved measures to achieve an overall sitewide reduction in regulated CO2 emissions of at least 46.06% (equating to 136 tonnes of CO2 per year) beyond Building Regulations Part L 2013. These CO2 savings shall be achieved through the following Lean, Clean, Green Energy Hierarchy:",
    "i.\tLean, passive design measures to achieve an annual reduction of at least 10.79% equating to at least 28.79 tonnes in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over BR Part L 2013 for the residential development, and at least 18.12%, equating to at least 5.29 tonnes, over Part L 2013 for the non-residential space.",
    "ii.\tGreen, renewable energy equipment including the incorporation of three photovoltaic PV arrays with a combined total capacity of at least 41 kWp, and three air-to-water Air Source Heat Pump distribution loops to achieve an annual reduction of at least 34.54%, equating to 102.22 tonnes, in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over Part L 2013.",
    "iii.\tSeen, heat and electric meters installed to monitor the performance of the PV and the carbon efficiency (COP) of the heat pumps including the heat generation and the combined parasitic loads of the heat pumps.",
    "The energy generation equipment shall be operational following notification under Condition 25 part a).",
    "c)\tPrior to commencement of construction details of the specifications, design, and layout of the proposed Air Source Heat Pumps and PV and associated monitoring devices required to identify their performance/efficiency (COP) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "d)\tPrior to construction completion details of the installed renewable/low-carbon energy equipment shall be submitted to the Council for approval. The details shall include the exact Heat Pump thermal kilowatt output, heat output pipe diameter(s), parasitic load supply schematics, monthly energy demand profile, and the exact number of PV arrays, the kWp capacity of each array, the orientation, pitch and mounting of the panels, and the make and model of the panels. The name and contact details of the heat pump and PV installation contractor(s), and if different, the commissioning electrical or plumbing contractor, should be submitted to the Council along with copies of the MCS certificates and all relevant commissioning documentation. The development shall be implemented only in accordance with the approved details following notification under Condition 25 part a)",
    "e)\tAll boilers to serve the energy requirements of the development detailed in the approved energy strategy should be specified with NOx emissions (g/m²) that are compliant with or better than the ultra-low NOx (g/m²) benchmarks as set out at Appendix 5 of the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG.",
    "f)\tDetails of the layout of the energy plant room and equipment and the method of how the facility shall be designed to connect to, or allow for future connection to, an offsite district heating network, if an on-site energy centre is provided.",
    "g)\tWithin three months of notification under Condition 25 part a) , the relevant Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and detailed SAP Worksheets showing clearly the TER and DER, and/or the Display Energy Certificates (DEC's), accompanying Advisory Reports and detailed BRUKL modelling output reports showing clearly the TER and BER from the 'as built stage' following completion of the development, shall be submitted to, and approved by, the Local Authority in order to confirm compliance with the energy efficiency measures detailed in the approved Energy Strategy. The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the approved details.",

    "a)\tUpon completion of the development suitable devices for monitoring the PV panels shall be installed. Upon implementation of the approved Energy Strategy following notification under Condition 25 part a) suitable devices for monitoring the efficiency (SCOP) of the Air Source Heat Pump system shall be installed. The monitored data for the PV arrays and Air Source Heat Pump systems shall be automatically submitted to the Council at daily intervals for a period of four years from implementation of the approved Energy Strategy and full operation of the energy equipment. The installation of the monitoring devices and the submission and format of the data shall be carried out in accordance with the Council's approved specifications as indicated in the Automated Energy Monitoring Platform (AEMP) information document. The developer must contact the Council's chosen AEMP supplier (Energence Ltd) on commencement of construction to facilitate the monitoring process.",
    "b)\tUpon implementation of the approved Energy Strategy following notification under Condition 25 part a), the developer must submit to the Council proof of a contractual arrangement with a certified contractor that provides for the ongoing, commissioning, maintenance, and repair of the renewable/low-carbon energy equipment for a period of 12 months following the date the implementation of the approved Energy Strategy and to continue for a further 24 month period to appoint a certified contractor(s) for the ongoing commissioning, maintenance and repair of the renewable/low carbon energy equipment.\"",
