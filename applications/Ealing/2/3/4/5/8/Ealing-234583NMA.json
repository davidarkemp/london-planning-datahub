    "Given the nature of the proposed amendment and considering the original planning conditions, the proposal would meet the Council's criteria for non-material amendments due to the following reasons:",
    "- \tThere would be no material impact on any neighbours or other statutory and non-statutory bodies, and the resulting scheme would not be materially different in its external appearance and would remain within the fee paid and in accordance with the adopted policies of the Council.",
    "- \tThe changes would not compromise the overall design and appearance of the development.",
    "-  \tThe resulting scheme would not conflict with any existing planning conditions or legal agreement.",
    "Therefore, the proposal represents a 'non-material' change from the original planning application with regards to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and will not require assessment through the submission of a full planning application.",
    "| Condition 13 of Ref: 205322FUL dated 17.08.2023 to read as follows:",
    "13. Fresh Air Ventilation",
    "Prior to its installation, details for a scheme providing fresh air mechanical extraction to habitable rooms on the East Acton Lane fa√ßade with the supply from high level at the rear or sides of the building at each floor shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved scheme shall be fully installed and operational prior to the first occupation of the development and thereafter permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the amenity, health and air quality of future occupiers in accordance with policies D6 and SI1 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).",
    "| Condition 19 of Ref: 205322FUL dated 17.08.2023 to read as follows:",
    "19. External Noise from Machinery, Ventilation and Mechanical Installations",
    "(A) Prior to their installation, details of the external rating noise level emitted from plant/machinery/equipment/ducting/air in- and outlets/mechanical installations, together with mitigation measures as appropriate shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The measures shall ensure that the external rating noise level LAeq emitted will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "(B) Prior to the first occupation of the hereby approved development, a post installation sound assessment shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The assessment shall be carried out to confirm compliance with the noise criteria set out in Part A of this condition and shall include additional steps to mitigate noise, as necessary.",
    "Approved details shall be implemented prior to the first occupation/ use of plant/ machinery/ equipment and shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the units and surrounding sites in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of the London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Condition 28 of Ref: 205322FUL dated 17.08.2023 to read as follows:",
    "28. Energy and CO2",
    "A) Prior to the completion of construction and the first occupation of the hereby approved development, the development shall implement and maintain (and in the case of energy generation equipment confirm as operational) the approved measures to achieve an overall sitewide reduction in regulated CO2 emissions of at least 64.95% (equating to 22.42 tonnes of CO2 per year) beyond Building Regulations Part L 2013. These CO2 savings shall be achieved through the Lean, Clean, Green Energy Hierarchy as detailed in the approved Energy Statement prepared by Cundall in August 2021 (revision C) including:",
    "i. Lean, passive design measures to achieve an annual reduction of at least 14.54% equating to at least 5.02 tonnes in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over BR Part L 2013.",
    "ii. Green, renewable energy equipment including the incorporation of two photovoltaic arrays with a combined total capacity of at least 12.4 kWp, and Air Source Heat Pump(s) to achieve an annual reduction of at least 50.41%, equating to 17.4 tonnes, in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over Part L 2013.",
    "iii. Seen, heat and electric meters installed to monitor the performance of the PV and the carbon efficiency (COP) of the heat pumps including the heat generation and the combined parasitic loads of the heat pumps.",
    "B) Prior to the installation of the proposed low and zero-carbon (LZC) energy equipment, details of their specifications, including manufacturers performance data sheets, design, and layout, and the associated monitoring devices required to identify their performance/efficiency, shall be submitted, to and approved in writing, by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be implemented only in accordance with the approved details.",
    "C) Prior to the installation of the renewable/low-carbon energy equipment, technical details of the equipment shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The details shall include the exact heat pump thermal kilowatt output, heat output pipe diameter(s), parasitic load supply schematics, monthly energy demand profile, and the exact number of PV arrays, the kWp capacity of each array, the orientation, pitch and mounting of the panels, and the make and model of the panels. The name and contact details of the LZC installation contractor(s), and if different, the commissioning electrical or plumbing contractor, shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority prior to installation.",
    "D) On completion of the installation of the LZC equipment, copies of the MCS certificates and all relevant commissioning documentation shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing.",
    "E) Within three months of the occupation/first use of the development, the relevant Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and detailed SAP Worksheets, showing clearly the TER and DER from the 'as built stage' following completion of the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority in order to confirm compliance with the energy efficiency measures detailed in the approved Energy Strategy. The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason: In the interest of addressing climate change and to secure environmentally sustainable development in accordance with policies SI2 and SI3 of the London Plan (2021), the GLA Energy Assessment Guidance (2020), policies 5.2 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012)."
