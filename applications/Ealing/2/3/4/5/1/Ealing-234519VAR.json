    "The proposed changes to the roof design would introduce an incongruous and awkward roof form that would be out of keeping with the approved pattern of development in the area. The proposed dormer roof to the new dwelling would create excessive bulk and mass within the roofscape when considered cumulatively with the existing roof extension to the original dwelling house. The proposed amendment would accordingly be, contrary  to policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). Therefore it is considered that the proposal does not fall within the provisions of s73 of the Town and Country Planning Act or the Council's Protocol for Minor Material Amendments."
