    "The proposed development, by virtue of absence of furniture plans, cramped kitchen areas, lack of outdoor and indoor communal spaces, and insufficient provision of cycle and bin storage, has failed to demonstrate that the proposed bedrooms would not form any self-contained flat, and would cumulatively lead to compromised and unsatisfactory living conditions to the detriment of the wellbeing of future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D6, H9, T5 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013, and Ealing Council's Standards for Houses in Multiple Occupation (2016)."
