    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its height, bulk, width, design, and scale would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would fail to appear subordinate to the original house and would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
