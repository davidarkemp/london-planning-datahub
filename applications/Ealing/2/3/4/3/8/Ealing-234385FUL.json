    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its mass, bulk, scale, width and flat roof design, would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the property's original scale and character, to detriment of the appearance and character of the host property and local area. The inaccurate drawings would also fail to achieve a satisfactory outcome. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18), SPD4 Residential Extensions and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance. | The proposed flats, by reason of their poor outlook and light from one of the units (Flat A) and the absence of sectional drawings to demonstrate sufficient headroom height in Flats A and B would result in substandard amenity and living conditions for future occupants. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policies D5 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed cycle parking arrangement would not be well located to the occupants and is not consistent with policies T5 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 6.1 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).",
    "| The proposed crossover, by reason of its siting, width and lack of visibility splay information, would result in a potential road safety risk to the surrounding transport network. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy T6 of The London Plan (2021) and Ealing Council's Dropped Kerb: Application Pack for Residents (July 2021)."
