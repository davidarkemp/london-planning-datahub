    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its height, bulk, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of conservation area. Furthermore, the proposed floor layout appears inaccurate. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with would be contrary to the NPPF (2023), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022."
