    "The proposed vehicular and pedestrian gates with metal railings, due to its height (1.88m), would be out of keeping with the character of the neighbouring buildings and the street scene in general, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building, the street scene and the wider area. The proposed development fails to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
