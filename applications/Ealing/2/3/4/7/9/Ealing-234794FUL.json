    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title(s)",
    "Location Plan, Block Plan, E001, E002, E003, E004, P001, P002, P003, P004, P005,",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| The hereby approved ^IN; rooflights to the roof slope of the hereby approved development shall not project more than 150mm from the plane of the roof slope when measured perpendicularly and shall be retained as such for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, and to safeguard the character and appearance of the  area in accordance with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the designated location identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
