    "The proposed first floor rear extension, first floor front infill extension and two storey side extension, by reason of their bulk, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute illogical, incongruous and dominant additions to the host building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of the area and would harm the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers to the detriment of the character and appearance of the street scene. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
