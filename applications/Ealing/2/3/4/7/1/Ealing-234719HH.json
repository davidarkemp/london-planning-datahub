    "The proposed roof extension by reason of its scale, bulk and massing would constitute an incongruous overdevelopment that would fail to appear subordinate to the original dwelling and would be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area and as such would constitute an inappropriate form of development, and therefore be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposal would result in harm to the residential amenity of neighbouring residences, in regard to a loss of outlook, overbearing appearance and sense of enclosure, contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
