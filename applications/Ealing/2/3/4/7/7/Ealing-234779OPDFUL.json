    "The proposed mansard roof extension by reason of its bulk, mass and height, would result in the accumulative overdevelopment of the site and is therefore unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal is contrary policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and  Policy D3 of the OPDC Local Plan (2022). | The proposed first floor extension by reason of its bulk, mass and height, would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, that would create an increased sense of enclosure and harm the visual amenities of No. 3 Brett Villas. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy D5 Of the OPDC Local Plan (2022). | The proposed increase in height of the dwelling, by reason of its close proximity to the boundary with North Acton Cemetery and the trees that exist along its perimeter, would likely result in the requirement for the excessive pruning of these trees, causing irreparable damage to these trees, to the detriment of the green infrastructure of the area and the visual amenity and character of the cemetery. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies G1 and G7 of the London Plan and Policy SP8 of the OPDC Local Plan (2022)."
