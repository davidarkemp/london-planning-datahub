    "The proposed works go beyond the recommendations set out in British Standard 3998:2010 Tree Work - Recommendations, section 7.7.2.  Healthy and structurally sound trees are capable of tolerating crown reductions of 30% of leaf volume, which is detailed as approximately 12% of branch length (allowing for variation in species).  The proposed works go well beyond this maximum level, and as no information has been provided to show special/exceptional reasons (subsidence damage, structural damage to the tree, etc.) for such a level of reduction the works we raise an objection to. Therefore, we are placing a Tree Preservation Order on the tree."
