    "The proposed development, in combination with the existing extensions, by virtue of their mass, bulk and lack of design integrity, would result in an illogical and incongruous form of development to the detriment of the character and street scene of the area and the architectural integrity of the host building. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies 7B and 7,4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The proposed development, by virtue of the excessive side windows on the east elevation, would result in undue overlooking to the detriment of the residential amenities of no.59 Gonville Crescent. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
