    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "| The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings: Site Location Plan; Block/Site Plan; ECDL/521/E/P/1 (Existing Floor Plans); ECDL/521/E/P/2 (Proposed Floor Plans); ECDL/521/E/P/3 (Existing Front and Rear Elevations); ECDL/521/E/P/4 (Existing and Proposed Side Elevations); ECDL/521/E/P/5 (Existing and Proposed Block Plan).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| The cycle parking store identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 shall be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the hereby approved flats and shall be permanently retained for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate cycle storage facilities for future occupiers in accordance with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The bin store identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 shall be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the hereby approved flats and shall be permanently retained for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate refuse facilities for future occupiers in accordance with policy SI 7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be based on environmental noise levels occurring during most of the year, ie. during school and work weekdays, and on noise limits specified by BS8233:2014. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall not exceed noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site, in accordance with Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The sound insulation of the floor/ceiling /wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses, namely, bedroom adjoining bathroom of separate dwelling, shall be enhanced by at least 5dB above the recommended Building Regulations values. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021)."
