    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: 000- A Site Plan; 002-A Existing Block Plan; 411-A Existing Elevation A, Proposed Elevation B and Proposed Key Plan; Design & Access Statement; Proposed layout of the ventilation, heating & comfort cooling(NG369/MC/01); Environmental Noise Survey And Fixed Plant Noise Assessment (R-9862-DJC2-RRM), dated 12/03/2024",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| External noise from machinery/equipment/extract/ventilation ducting/mechanical installations",
    "The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policies 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'.",
    "| Anti- vibration mounts and silencing of machinery etc.",
    "Prior to use, external and internal machinery, plant and equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of the London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Separation of commercial premises and facilities from dwellings",
    "The sound insulation of the floor/ceiling /wall structures separating the commercial/industrial parts of the building from dwellings shall be in accordance with the predicted internal noise rating level or shall be enhanced by at least 10/15/20dB, as necessary above the Building Regulations value for residential use, to prevent noise ingress of commercial noise to dwellings. Where commercial noise includes characteristic features, the Noise Rating level in habitable rooms shall not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins.  The above requirements shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the units and neighbouring amenity in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of the London Plan (2021), Standard 30 London Housing SPG 2016, Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
