    "The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive depth, design and scale, would constitute an incongruous and over dominant additional which would fail to integrate well with the host site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider area.  The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022). | The proposed development due to its excessive scale, design, bulk, depth would constitute an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities of no. 126 Woodlands Road. As such, the proposal fails to comply with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) | The proposed flats, by reason of their size and space (bedroom, living room, dining room and kitchen area and minimum ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75% of the Gross Internal Area, insufficient outlook and access to natural sunlight/daylight to the loft levelstudio and lack of access to private amenity space to proposed flats all of which would result in a cramped and substandard form of accommodation that would fail to provide acceptable living conditions for future occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to the Nationally Described Space Standards and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)., policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Housing SPG 2016, Ealing's development (Core) Strategy 2026 and Ealing local variation to London Plan policy 3.5 of the Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
