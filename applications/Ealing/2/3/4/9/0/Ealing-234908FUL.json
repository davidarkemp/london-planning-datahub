    "shall be formed in the walls or roof of the building permitted.",
    "Reason: To protect residential amenity in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
