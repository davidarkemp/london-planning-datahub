    "The proposed backland development, by virtue of its excessive height (being higher than the existing dwellings on the site), would be out of character  and harmful to the context and character of the area. This would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021. | The proposed development, by virtue of its height, bulk, mass and design would harmfully impact upon the amenities of 63 Darwin Road. It would give rise to an unacceptable overbearing impact and further reduce the ability of this neighbour to enjoy their outdoor amenity space. It would be an unneighbourly form of development and would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
