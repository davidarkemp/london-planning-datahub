Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2023), Policies 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan. | The proposed residential units, by reason of their unconventional and inefficient layouts, inadequate internal floor areas, excessive number of bedrooms to no. 7 the narrow arrangement of no. 7A, inadequate width to the proposed double bedroom within no. 7A, would constitute a substandard form of residential accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan, Policy LV3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan and the Mayor's Housing Design Standards LPG (2023)."
