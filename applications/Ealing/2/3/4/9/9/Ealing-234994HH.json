    "The proposed and already existing rear roof extension and projecting balcony are discordant additions to the host building and within the local area due to its lack of subordination in terms of scale, siting and materiality. It is out of keeping with the approved pattern of development in the area and conflicts with policies D1, D3 & D4 of the London Plan and policies 7.4 and 7B of Ealing DM DPD, chapter 5 of Ealing's Local Plan (Reg 19).",
    "| The combination of the canopy and the single storey rear extension creates an overly large projection from the rear of the original house and along the boundary with 65 Briar Cresent. This overdevelops the host site and unduly impacts the amenity of the neighbouring property at 65 Briar Crescent, in term of overbearing and enclosure, by creating built form along 8.4m of the adjoining boundary. This is in conflict with policies policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7A, 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's Local Plan Reg 19 (2024) and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance 2022."
