    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by reason of its excessive height and insubordinate design, would be unsympathetic to the host dwelling's original scale and character, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal is contrary policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18), SPD4 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022). | The proposed single storey side/rear extension, by reason of its excessive height, size and proximity to the boundary, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022). | The as-built drawings submitted with the application are manifestly inaccurate when compared to what is on site currently. The impact of the proposed development on the character of the area and host dwelling and the amenity of neighbouring properties cannot be accurately determined in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework 2023 - section 12, Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7A, 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's Local Plan 2023 and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
