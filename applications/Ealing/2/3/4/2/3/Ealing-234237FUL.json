Where commercial/industrial noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level should not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins (octaves) inside habitable rooms. Details shall include the installation method and materials of separating structures and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound level. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014.
