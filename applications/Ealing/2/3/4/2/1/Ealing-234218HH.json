    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its height, bulk, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would fail to appear subordinate to the original house and would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, height, and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would appear overdominant and overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties and would result in creation of enclosure and loss of outlook and daylight/sunlight to those properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
