    "The proposed extension to facilitate the proposed shisha lounge (sui generis) use within the premises, by reason of its open side elevations and separation distance from proposed acoustic barriers, would not adequately mitigate noise nuisance impacts on surrounding residential properties, including those on the upper floors of Royal Parade. Adequate sound insulation to mitigate excessive noise disturbance could only be achieved by enclosing the structure, which would fail to comply with Smoke-Free (Premises and Enforcement) Regulations 2006. Failure to provide adequate noise insulation of the premises to mitigate amplified music and sounds, talking, yelling and noise generated by the consumption of food would have a detrimental impact on the living conditions, quality of life and health of nearby residential properties. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Policies D13 and D14 of the London Plan, Planning Practice Guidance - Noise (2019) and the NPPF (2023)."
