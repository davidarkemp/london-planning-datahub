    "The proposed amendment to the approved scheme under ref: 205211OPDFUL dated 14/01/2022 is considered to be non-material with approved plans referenced 01/99 Site location plan, Cover letter prepared by Evans Jones Ltd in accordance with Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, National Planning Policy Guidance: Flexible Options for Planning Permissions (2014), and Ealing Council's Protocol for Non-Material Amendments following a grant of planning permission (2011). | Condition 15 of ref: 205211OPDFUL dated 14/01/2022 to read as follows:",
    "Energy and CO2",
    "a)\tWithin 6 months of first occupation, the permitted development shall implement and maintain, and in the case of energy generation equipment confirm as operational, the approved measures to achieve an overall sitewide reduction in regulated CO2 emissions against SAP10 standards of at least 40.54% (equating to 7.5 tonnes of CO2 per year) beyond Building Regulations Part L 2013. These CO2 savings shall be achieved through the Lean, Clean, Green Energy Hierarchy as detailed in the Energy Statement prepared by C80 Solutions in August 2021(v-1). including:",
    "i.\tLean, passive design measures to achieve an annual reduction of at least 18.92% equating to at least 3.5 tonnes in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over BR Part L 2013.",
    "ii.\tGreen, renewable energy equipment including the incorporation of two photovoltaic arrays with a combined total capacity of at least 36 kWp to achieve an annual reduction of at least 21.62%, equating to 4 tonnes, in regulated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over Part L 2013.",
    "iii.\tSeen, heat and electric meters installed to monitor the performance of the PV.",
    "b)\tWithin 6 months of first occupation, details of the specifications including manufacturers performance data sheets, design, and layout of the proposed low and zero-carbon (LZC) energy equipment, and the associated monitoring devices required to identify their performance shall be submitted to, and approved in writing, by the Council. The development shall be implemented only in accordance with the approved details.",
    "c)\tPrior to the installation of the renewable/low-carbon energy equipment technical details of the equipment shall be submitted to the Council for approval. The details shall include the exact number of PV arrays, the kWp capacity of each array, the orientation, pitch and mounting of the panels, and the make and model of the panels. The name and contact details of the LZC installation contractor(s), and if different, the commissioning electrical or plumbing contractor, should be submitted to the Council prior to installation.",
    "d)\tOn completion of the installation of the LZC equipment copies of the MCS certificates and all relevant commissioning documentation shall be submitted to the Council.",
    "e)\tAll boilers to serve the energy requirements of the development detailed in the approved energy strategy should be specified with NOx emissions (g/m²) that are compliant with or better than the ultra-low NOx (g/m²) benchmarks as set out at Appendix 5 of the Mayor's Sustainable Design and Construction SPG.",
    "f)\tWithin nine months of the occupation/first use of the development the relevant Display Energy Certificates (DEC's), accompanying Advisory Reports and detailed BRUKL modelling output reports showing clearly the TER and BER from the 'as built stage' following completion of the development, shall be submitted to, and approved by, the Local Authority in order to confirm compliance with the energy efficiency measures detailed in the approved Energy Strategy. The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason: In the interest of addressing climate change and to secure environmentally sustainable development in accordance with policies SI2 and SI3 of the London Plan (2021), and the relevant guidance notes in the GLA Energy Assessment Guidance 2020, policies LV5.2 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013, and policies 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2012. | Condition 16 of ref: 205211OPDFUL dated 14/01/2022 to read as follows:",

    "b)\tWithin 6 months of first occupation, the agreed suitable devices for monitoring the performance of the PV panels shall be installed. The monitored data shall be automatically submitted to the Council at daily intervals for a period of four years from occupation and full operation of the energy equipment. The installation of the monitoring devices and the submission and format of the data shall be carried out in accordance with the Council's approved specifications as indicated in the Automated Energy Monitoring Platform (AEMP) information document. The developer must contact the Council's chosen AEMP supplier (Energence Ltd) on commencement of construction to facilitate the monitoring process.",
