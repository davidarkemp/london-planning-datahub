    "The proposed development, by reason of its projection beyond the established building line with Number 40 Lynton Road, the sheerness of the pitch of the mansard roof, the loss of the coping detailing, and the loss of the recessed balcony on the front elevation, would adversely affect the street scene on Lynton Road and Shalimar Road. The proposed development would be of lower quality than what was approved previously and would appear overly dominant and overbearing when viewed from surrounding streets. The development would fail to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed balcony on the front elevation serving Unit 07 of the development would be in an elevated position relative to ground levels, giving rise to the potential for direct overlooking and loss of privacy of the neighbouring property at Number 40 Lynton Road. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
