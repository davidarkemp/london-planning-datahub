    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title numbers: AA23/HS/002 Rev 00; AA23/HS/001 Rev 00; AA23/HS/003 Rev 01; AA23/HS/004 Rev 01; AA23/HS/005 Rev 01; AA23/HS/006 Rev 01; DESIGN AND ACCESS STATEMENT AND HERITAGE STATEMENT SEPT 2023; PREMISES MANAGEMENT PLAN SEPT 2023",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning. | A noise assessment shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, within 6 months of the date of this permission, of external noise levels from transport and industrial/ commercial/ cultural sources, having regard to the assessment standards of the Council's SPG10. Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10. Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces and achieve criteria of BS8233:2014. The approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "| The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason:   To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "| Within 6 months of the date of this permission, machinery, plant and equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "Reason:  To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by vibration noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policy D14 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "| Details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, within 6 months of the date of this permission, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining/stacked dwellings/areas, namely, studio bedspace below and adjoining bathrooms of separate studio flats. The assessment and mitigation measures shall have regard to noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

    "| Details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, within 6 months of the date of this permission, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 10dB/ 15dB, as necessary, above the Building Regulations value for residential use, of the floor/ ceiling/ walls separating the studio flats from communal entrance/staircase and commercial premises.  Where commercial noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level should not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins (octaves) inside habitable rooms. Details shall include the installation method and materials of separating structures and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound level. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Policies E7.A.7 DM DPD, Standard 30 London Housing SPG 2016 and Policy D14 London Plan.",
    "| The premises shall, at all times, be limited to short term accommodation within Class C1. The space shall not be occupied at any time by any people that would be subject to an Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement that would permit a person to have any of the rooms as their principal place of residence. The premises shall continue to be managed in accordance with the approved Management Plan in perpetuity.",
    "Reason: The quality of the accommodation proposed would provide inadequate living conditions for long term residential occupation and would fail to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan."
