    "The proposed roof extensions by reason of design, scale, bulk, massing, siting and roof forms would result in a form of overdevelopment of the subject site which would adversely affect the character of the original dwellinghouse as well as the character of the area. As such the proposed development would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, height and fenestrational detail, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would result in loss of privacy to those properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The submitted drawings have failed to demonstrate the actual direction of the elevations of the site and the roof plan. They also inaccurately reflect the drawings detail in corresponding drawing plans. As such, the proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
