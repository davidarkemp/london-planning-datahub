    "The proposed first floor extensions, by virtue of the siting, size, scale and design would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. The proposed changes would unduly draw the eye and would be a harmful and incongruous feature within the street scene. The proposed changes would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area and would be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The depth of the proposed first floor rear extension would harmfully enclose the upper floor window to the rear of number 38 Bilton Road. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021). | The siting of the bike store would not be practical and would not provide an area that is 'fit for purpose'. It would also inhibit and restrict access to the flats. The scheme is therefore considered contrary to planning policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 and T5 of the London Plan (2021)."
