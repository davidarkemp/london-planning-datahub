    "The proposed cumulative bulk of the ground floor side/rear, first floor rear and roof extensions, by reason of their depth, mass and bulk, would result in an incongruous and clear overdevelopment which is overly dominant and unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to detriment of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022) and SPD4 Residential Extensions. | The proposed residential development would provide inadequate amenity and living conditions for future occupiers by reason of its layout, undersized gross internal floor area (flat 5) and poor external amenity space all of which would result in a cramped and substandard form of accommodation that would fail to provide acceptable living conditions for future occupiers. The development is therefore contrary to the Nationally Described Space Standards and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)., policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Housing SPG 2016, Ealing's development (Core) Strategy 2026 and Ealing local variation to London Plan policy 3.5 of the Ealing's Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed development due to its scale, design and siting in a constrained rear garden site would be unduly dominant and out of keeping with the established pattern of development in the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy D3 of The London Plan (2021), and policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing's Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of insufficient internal space provision and a lack of private amenity spaces, within an identified area of Local and District Park Deficiency, would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation and overdevelopment of the application site, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor's Housing SPG and Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The loss of a family sized unit and lack of appropriate housing mix in the proposal would fail to meet Ealing Council's strategic requirement for larger homes within the borough, contrary to Ealing Council's Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2022) and policies H9  and H10 of the London Plan (2021)."
