    "Given the size and location of the basement and the lack of retained garden space, the proposal would constitute overdevelopment and the basement would fail to integrate well into the garden setting by adding a disproportionate addition over and above the size of the original building and garden. The proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | Given the size and location of the basement excavation under most of the rear garden area, the basement would result in an unacceptable impact on flood risk and would impact a significant, mature Tilia (Lime) street tree adjacent to the site. This would be contrary to Policies D10, G7 and SI 12 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 5.10 and 5.12 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | A Construction Management Plan (CMP) as not been provided for the proposed basement excavation. Given the size of the basement, it is considered that the excavation would result in an unacceptable impact on neighbour's amenity due to the prolonged disruption from noise, vibration, dust and spoil removal. The proposal fails to comply with Policy D10 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
