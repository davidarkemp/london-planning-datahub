    "The proposed development by reason of design, scale, bulk, massing, siting and roof forms and relationship with the original building represents an incongruous and overbearing form of development on this site, out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in the area. The addition of new windows will also create a sense of overlooking and loss of privacy, impacting the residential amenity of neighbouring properties. As such the proposed development would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022."
