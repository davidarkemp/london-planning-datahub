    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its depth, scale, design and appearance, particularly in conjunction with the existing outbuilding, and the resultant remaining rear garden space, would constitute an incongruous and overbearing form of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider area. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Chapter 12, the London Plan (2021) policies D3, D4, and D5, and the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B. | The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height, scale, site coverage and projection along the boundary would constitute an oppressive form of overdevelopment, that would result in an undue sense of enclosure and loss of light to no. 8 Bowes Road. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
