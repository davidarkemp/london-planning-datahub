    "The proposed development by reason of its height, scale, design, siting and access arrangements, would result in an overbearing impact, increased feeling of enclosure and constitutes a dominant, obtrusive and incongruous form of development which would be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area and as such would constitute an inappropriate form of development, as well as failing to provide a sense or feeling of safety for future occupiers to their detriment. As such the proposed development would be contrary policies GG2, D1, D3, D4, D6, D11, T2, T3, T6 and T7 of the London Plan (2021); policies 3.5 and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and Section 12 of the NPPF (2021). | The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, height, fenestrational detail, and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would appear overdominant and overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties, and would result in overlooking, loss of privacy and loss of light to those properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 (g) and 2.1 (c) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012. | The proposal due to its poor internal floor area and inadequate floor to ceiling height, would provide poor outlook, inadequate level of sunlight and lack to privacy screening, inadequate layout to make provision for refuse, recycling and cycle parking would result in substandard amenity and living conditions for future occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D4, D6, SI8 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
