    "The proposed roof extension by reason of scale, width, height, bulk, prominence and visual impact would be an oversized, obtrusive and illogical form of development that would cause unacceptable disruption to the local roofscape and street scene and would result in out of keeping with the character of the area. The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its height, scale, siting, proximity to boundaries and design, would represent an overbearing, illogical, oversized and dominant addition to the host site and would harm the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
