    "The proposed development, by reason of the bulk, mass and design of the part single storey, part two-storey side/rear (wrap around) extension, and the design of the external alterations to the existing two-storey side extension and the first-floor rear box window, would result in a development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character to detriment of the host dwelling and the character and appearance of the local area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of the scale, sitting and design of the part single storey, part two-storey side/rear (wrap around) extension, would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, that would create an increased sense of enclosure and harm the visual amenities of Nos. 20 and 24 Denmark Road. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
