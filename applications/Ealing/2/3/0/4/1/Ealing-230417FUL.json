    "The conversion of an existing doctors surgery into a residential house would result in the loss of an operational health and social care facility. The doctors surgery is currently being used and is in operation and is providing a required need to the surrounding public. The conversion and loss of this space would therefore be contrary to Planning Policy S2 of the London Plan 2021. | The proposed hip to gable conversion along with the siting, size and scale of the dormer window would be readily visible and would cause harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. The proposed siting would also harmfully detract from the setting of the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area as well as the adjacent listed building (Church of St Barnabus). The scheme is therefore considered contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013."
