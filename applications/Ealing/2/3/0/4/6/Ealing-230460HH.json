    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of its height, bulk, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area. The proposed rear extensions, by reason of its excessive depth, would constitute overdevelopment of the application site, that would be against the prevailing pattern of development and cause harm to the character and appearance of the area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The proposed Juliette balconies on the first floor, by reason of its design and fenestration detail, would be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area, which would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would loss of privacy to those properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
