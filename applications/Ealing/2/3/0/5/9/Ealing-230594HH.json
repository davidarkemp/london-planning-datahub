    "The proposed basement excavation, by reason of its depth, scale, siting, proximity to boundaries, design and cumulative impact would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the building's original scale and character, and which results in the overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and local area. The development would therefore fail to comply with D3, D4 and D10 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The proposed garage and associated parking space, by reason of its excessive parking space in addition to the existing parking spaces would compromise pedestrian safety and highway users, reduce the provision of on-street parking. The development would therefore be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy T6, policy 1.1 (f) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and Application Pack for Residents\" (dated July 2021)."
