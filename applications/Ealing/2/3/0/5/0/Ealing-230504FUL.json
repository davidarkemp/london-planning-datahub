It is currently used by volunteers to make tea/ coffee/ lunch for themselves and visitors during on site meetings and events. We intend that use to continue alongside the café use. This part of the building has never in fact been used for book shelves or book storage/ library equipment and was also used as a kitchen when the library was still run by LB Ealing Council until 2019.\n\nNB. NO EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL RESTRUCTURING WORK IS INTENDED. We simply intend to purchase some additional equipment like a coffee machine, second fridge, signage and a table. ",
