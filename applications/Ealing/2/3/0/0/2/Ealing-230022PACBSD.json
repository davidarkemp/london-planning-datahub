    "| The building permitted to be used as a dwellinghouse by virtue of Class MA shall remain in use as a dwellinghouse within the meaning of Class C3 of Schedule 1 to the Use Classes Order and for no other purpose, except to the extent that the other purpose is ancillary to the use as a dwellinghouse.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and condition 6 of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 as amended.",

    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage, in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards, has been provided and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate disposal, storage and collection of waste and recycling in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021), the NPPF (2021) and the Council's Waste Management Guidelines. | Prior to the commencement of the development, a Ventilation Strategy Report to mitigate the impact of existing poor air quality for residents shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The report will contain details for the installation of a filtered fresh air ventilation system capable of mitigating elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in the external air for the residential unit.",
    "The report shall also include the following information:",
    "a) Details and locations of the ventilation intake locations",
    "b) Details and locations of ventilation extracts locations",
    "The maintenance and cleaning of the systems shall be undertaken regularly in accordance with manufacturer specifications and shall be the responsibility of the primary owner of the property. Approved details shall be fully implemented prior to the occupation/use of the development and thereafter permanently retained and maintained.",
    "Reason: To minimise exposure to existing poor air quality, and provide a suitable internal living environment for future occupiers, in accordance with policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021, policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Development Strategy 2026 DPD (2012); and policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).",

    "| Prior to commencement of the development (excluding demolition, initial site clearance and ground works), a noise assessment shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of external noise levels from transport and industrial/ commercial/ cultural sources, having regard to the assessment standards of the Council's SPG10, including aircraft noise data in Section 6, SPG10 (worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (60 dB).  Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10.",
    "Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve criteria of BS8233:2014. The approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

    "| The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason:  To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013).",

    "| The sound insulation of the floor/ceiling /wall structures separating commercial premises from the habitable rooms shall be enhanced by at least 10dB/15dB, as necessary above the recommended Building Regulations value for dwellings. Where commercial noise sources include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level should not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins inside a habitable room. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
