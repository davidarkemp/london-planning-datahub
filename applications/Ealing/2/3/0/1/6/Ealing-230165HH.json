    "The proposed part single, part two-storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, design, its proximity to the site boundary and its relationship with surrounding properties, would appear as an incongruous, overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, which would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook and create an undue sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the living conditions and visual amenities of the neighbouring occupiers. As such the proposed development would fail to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021); Policies 74, 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the guidance in SPD 4 Residential Extensions. | The proposed rear roof extension, by reason of its scale and proximity to the site boundaries, would appear top-heavy, dominate the rear roofslope and fail to be subordinate to the host property, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider area. As such the proposed development would fail to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021); Policies 74, 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the guidance in SPD 4 Residential Extensions."
