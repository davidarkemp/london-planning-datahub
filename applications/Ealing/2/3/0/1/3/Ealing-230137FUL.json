    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings: PP/CU/1222/2 A; PROPOSED CHANGE OF USE FROM RETAIL SHOP TO COIN OPERATED LAUNDERETTE (SUI GENERIS); Design and Access Statement; PP/CU/1222/1: PROPOSED CHANGE OF USE FROM RETAIL SHOP TO COIN OPERATED LAUNDERETTE (SUI GENERIS)",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| An effective extract system shall be installed, operated and maintained as such. The extract duct shall terminate vertically without cowl at least 1m above the eaves of the main building. Equipment and ducting shall be sited with anti-vibration mounts and silencers. Mitigation measures shall ensure that noise and vibration transmission to noise sensitive receivers via external façades will not exceed a noise rating level within habitable rooms of NR20 dB and externally be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of the London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "| Prior to first use of the development hereby approved, details of anti-vibration measures shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing.  The measures shall ensure that machinery, plant, equipment/ extract/ ventilation system and ducting are mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors are vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced.

Where noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level shall not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins (octaves) inside habitable rooms. Details shall include the installation method and materials of separating structures and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound level within dwellings. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
