    "The proposed rear extensions and outbuilding, by reason of their height, bulk, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area. The proposed rear extensions, by reason of its excessive depth, would constitute overdevelopment of the application site, that would be against the prevailing pattern of development and cause harm to the character and appearance of the area.  As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The proposed development, by reason of its scale, bulk, prominence and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development that would have an overbearing nature and lead to a loss of outlook and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
