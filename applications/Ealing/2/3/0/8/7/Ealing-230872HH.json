    "The proposed first-floor side extension would be attached to the existing two-storey side extension, and by reason of its excessive total width, scale and bulk, would result in an unreasonable degree of impact in terms of being overbearing, incongruous and over dominant, and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the property, the streetscene and locality. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
