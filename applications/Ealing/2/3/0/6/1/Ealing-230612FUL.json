    "| The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed and implemented with regard to the Council's standards in the SPG10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Any required mitigation measures shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
