    "The proposed side extensions, by virtue of the overall design and bulk, would result in discordant and contrived roof profiles and eave relationships with the main roof and would lead to the overall bulk of extensions not subservient to the host dwelling, to the detriment of the architectural integrity of the main house, the coherent pattern of development within the area and the aim of optimising site capacity through a design-led approach. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013 and the Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022."
