Such provision shall be brought into use prior to first occupation and retained permanently.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate refuse and recycling storage to protect the amenities of the area and the living conditions of occupiers of the proposed residential units and the surrounding area, in accordance with policy 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and policies SI8 of the London Plan (2021).",
