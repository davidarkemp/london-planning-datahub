    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved drawings and documents:  A01 Rev P1, A02 Rev P1, A03 Rev P1, A04 Rev P1, A05 Rev P1, A06 Rev P1, A07 Rev P1, A40 Rev P1, A24 Rev P1, A25 Rev P1, A26 Rev P1, A27 Rev P1, A28 Rev P1, A29 Rev P2, A800 Rev P1, Fire Strategy A200 Rev P1, Planning Statement Issue P2 by J79 Studio (September 2023).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Notwithstanding any information submitted with this application, details of the materials to be used for the external surfaces of the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any part of the development hereby approved is commenced. The details shall be fully implemented as approved.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B; London Plan (2021) policy D3; and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Cycle storage for 7 bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the development, within a secure, lockable area in accordance with the designated locations identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and all adopted standards prior to the first occupation of the building. The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To promote sustainable patterns of transport, in accordance with Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the designated location identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate disposal, storage and collection of waste and recycling, to protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of highway and pedestrian safety all in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) and 6.1 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A  of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy SI7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed and implemented with regard to the Council's standards in the SPG10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall not exceed noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the internal environment of the development and living conditions of future occupiers of the site and occupiers of nearby properties, in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'. | Prior to commencement of the development, (excluding demolition, initial site clearance and ground works), details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 10dB/ 15dB, as necessary above the Building Regulations value for residential use, of the floor/ ceiling/ walls separating the commercial premises from dwellings.  Where noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level should not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins inside habitable rooms. Details shall include the installation method and materials of separating structures and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound level. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'. | Control measures shall ensure that the following standards are implemented:",
    "- noise and vibration (according to Approved CoP BS 5228-1 and -2:2009+A1:2014),",
    "- dust (according to Supplementary Planning Guidance by the GLA (2014) for The Control of Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition),",
    "- lighting ('Guidance Note 01/20 For The Reduction Of Obtrusive Light' by the Institution of Lighting Professionals),",
    "- hours of work and all associated activities audible beyond the site boundary restricted to 0800-1800hrs Mondays to Fridays, 0800 -1300 Saturdays (no work on public holidays),",
    "- notifications of works to interested parties and regular neighbour liaison,  - public display of contact details including accessible phone numbers for persons responsible for the site works for the duration of the works in case of emergencies or complaints.",
    "Reason:  To protect the amenity of neighbouring occupiers and to ensure adequate highway and site safety in accordance with policies 1.1(e), 1.1(j) and 2.1(c) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies Si1, SI2, T4 and D14  of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Greater London Authority Best Practice Guidance 'The Control of Dust and Emissions from Construction and Demolition (2006), BS 5228-1:2009 - Code of practice for noise & vibration control on construction & open sites-Part 1: Noise.",
    "| Prior to the commencement of the development (excluding demolition, initial site clearance and ground works), a Ventilation Strategy Report to mitigate the impact of existing poor air quality for residents shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The report will contain details for the installation of a filtered fresh air ventilation system capable of mitigating elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in the external air for the residential dwelling. The report shall also include the following information:",
    "i) Details and locations of the ventilation intake locations of all floors",
    "ii) Details and locations of ventilation extracts locations of all floors",
    "The maintenance and cleaning of the systems shall be undertaken regularly in accordance with manufacturer specifications and shall be the responsibility of the primary owner of the property. Approved details shall be fully implemented prior to the occupation/use of the development and thereafter permanently retained and maintained.",
    "Reason: To minimise exposure to existing poor air quality, and provide a suitable internal living environment for future occupiers, in accordance with policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021, policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Development Strategy 2026 DPD (2012); and policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
