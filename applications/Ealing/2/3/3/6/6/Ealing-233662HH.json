    "The proposed 2-storey side/rear extension, by reason of its design, excessive size and scale, would result a dominant and overbearing addition to the property, to the detriment of the character, appearance and design of the conservation area. The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4, Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022), Haven Green Conservation Area Character Management Plan (2008) and Ealing's Generic Management Plan for Conservation Areas (2023). | The proposed 2-storey side/rear extension, by reason of its excessive size and depth, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties and would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4, Ealing Housing Design Guide."
