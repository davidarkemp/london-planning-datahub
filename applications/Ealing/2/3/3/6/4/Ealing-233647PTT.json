  "description": "TPO 518 T2 sycamore. The southern tree is very large and encroaching on the house, coming into contact this year. And will require a trimming and pruning to restore a 2m clearance to the building as well as needing crown cleaning to remove dead ivy and the crown will to be trimmed and lifted by up to 3 metres above the public pavement. \nTPO 518 T3 sycamore. The  tree to the north has a lot of dead ivy that will need to be cleaned from the crown and as this tree was choked for a long time by the ivy a crown had not fully developed so tree surgery will be needed to remove deadwood and help a new crown form.\n\n",
