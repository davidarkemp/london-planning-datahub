    "The proposed demolition of a public house and change of use to mixed use residential and retail (Use classes C3 and E) would be contrary to Policy HC7 of the London Plan 2021, and the NPPF (section 93) which seeks to protect pub use and appearance where this contributes to the character, culture or community life of the area. | The proposed development does not demonstrate reasonable justification for the loss of the existing building and the public house. Furthermore no evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that there is not a reasonable prospect of re-use or refurbishment of the existing public house. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), policy HC7 of the London Plan (2021), and policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate design, bulk and mass would constitute in a bulky, incongruous and over dominant development harming the character and appearance of the area. The development would therefore fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), and policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The cumulative impact of:",
    "-\tProliferation of single-bedroom units",
    "-\tContrived internal room arrangements",
    "-\tLack of natural daylight for the kitchen area of flats 3 and 4",
    "-\tInsufficient evidence to demonstrate avoidance of overheating for single-aspect units,",
    "would lead to poor living conditions for future occupants, would represent an improper housing mix, and would fail to optimise site capacity through a design-led approach. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing DPD 2013.",
    "| The proposed development by reason of its massing, siting & incongruous design, would result in a harmful visual impact, sense of enclosure, and loss of privacy on the residential amenities of No. 01 Shackleton Road contrary to Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), and policies 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed housing mix, by virtue of proliferation of one-bedroom units would conflict with the Council's strategic market housing needs. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy H10 of the London Plan 2021, Ealing Local Housing Needs Assessment Update 2022 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The proposed enlargement of the existing dropped kerbs, by virtue of the proximity with the closest junction, would be detrimental in terms of highway safety.
