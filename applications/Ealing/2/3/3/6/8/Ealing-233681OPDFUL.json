    "The proposed Class E(g) use would introduce a non-conforming use within a Strategic Industrial Location (SIL) to the detriment of the integrity and effectiveness of the SIL and the existing B8 use. The proposal would fail to comply with Policies E4, E5 and E7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies P5 and E1 of the OPDC Local Plan (2018), Policy 4A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Policies 1.1 and 3.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed three-storey and four-storey flat-roofed extension would, by reason of its massing and height, box-like form, colour palette and lack of fenestration, constitute a prominent feature, out of keeping with the character of the area and overbearing in the street scene. The proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy D3 of the OPDC Local Plan (2018), and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | A Parking Design and Management Plan has not been provided showing how the proposed car parking and the existing B8 use would function without detriment to safety on site and highway safety. The proposal would fail to comply with Policy T3, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021)."
