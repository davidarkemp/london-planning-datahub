The proposed development would appear overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties and would result in sense of enclosure and loss of light. As such, the proposal is contrary to the policies of the NPPF (2023), D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
