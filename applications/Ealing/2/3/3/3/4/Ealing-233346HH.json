    "The proposed rear roof extension, by reason of its excessive width, scale and design, would constitute an overbearing and incongruous form of development that would dominate the roofscape and be materially out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development along this street, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property and Conservation Area.  As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the Ealing Town Centre Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Plan (2007), SPD 4 - Residential extensions and section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
