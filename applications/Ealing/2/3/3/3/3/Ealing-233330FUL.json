    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings: PL-100 Rev 0 (OS Map and Block Plan); PL-101 Rev 01 (Existing Site); PL-102 Rev 01 (Proposed Site); PL-103 Rev 01 (Existing and Proposed Ground Floor Plan); PL-104 Rev 01 (Existing and Proposed Roof Plan); PL-105 Rev 01 (Existing and Proposed Elevations); PL-106 Rev 01 (Existing and Proposed Side Elevations); PL-107 Rev 01 (Existing and Proposed Section).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings listed under condition 2.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing DM DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18).",
    "| The bicycle storage area identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 shall be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the hereby approved flat and shall be permanently retained for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate cycle storage facilities for future occupiers in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The refuse and recycling storage area identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 shall be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the hereby approved flat and shall be permanently retained for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate refuse facilities for future occupiers in accordance with policy SI 7 of the London Plan (2021) and Ealing Council Waste Management Guidelines for Architects and Developers.",
    "| The site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57 dB). Before the development is commenced, details shall be submitted for approval by the Council in writing, for the sound insulation of the building envelope, assessed according to the criteria specified in Section 6, Ealing Supplementary Planning Guidance 10, and not exceeding the internal noise limits for sensitive rooms in BS8233:2014. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise), in accordance with Authority's criteria. The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: : In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site, in accordance with policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing DM DPD (2013), policy D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "| The sound insulation of the floor/ceiling /wall structures separating commercial space from bedrooms shall be enhanced by at least 10dB above the recommended Building Regulations value. Where commercial noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level should not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins inside habitable rooms. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: : In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site, in accordance with policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing DM DPD (2013), policy D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023)."
