    "The proposed conservatory, by reason of its design, PVCU materials, anthracite-grey colour and lack of traditional features, would be out of keeping with the character of the neighbouring buildings and the streetscene in general, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the Mount Park Conservation Area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2023), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the Mount Park Conservation Area Character Appraisal (2009), and the Mount Park Conservation Area Management Plan (2009)."
