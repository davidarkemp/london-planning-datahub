    "The proposed first floor rear extension due to its overall scale, depth, width, bulk and massing would fail to appear subordinate to the host building and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition that would be harmful to the character of the building and visual amenities of the area.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposal due to its siting, depth, width and proximity to No.36 Summit Road is considered to incur unacceptable impacts on neighbours in terms of a sense of enclosure and overbearing unneighbourly development. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policy 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D1, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
