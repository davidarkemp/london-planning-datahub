The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4, Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022) and Mill Hill Park Conservation Area Character Management Plan (2008)."
