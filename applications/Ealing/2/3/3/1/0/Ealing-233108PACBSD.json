    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and condition 6 of Schedule 2, Part 3, Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 as amended. | The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the following approved plans: 001 REV P01 (SITE LOCATION PLAN); 005 REV P01 (EXISTING BLOCK PLAN); 010 REV P01 (EXISTING GROUND FLOOR PLAN); 011 REV P01 (EXISTING FIRST FLOOR PLAN); 012 REV P01 (EXISTING ROOF PLAN); 070 REV P01 (EXISTING ELEVATIONS 1/2); 071 REV P01 (EXISTING ELEVATIONS 2/2); 110 REV P01 (PROPOSED GROUND FLOOR PLAN); 111 REV P01 (PROPOSED FIRST FLOOR PLAN); 112 REV P01 (PROPOSED ROOF PLAN); 170 REV P01 (PROPOSED ELEVATIONS 1/2); 171 REV P01 (PROPOSED ELEVATIONS 2/2); INTERNAL DAYLIGHT REVIEW LETTER EB7 LIMITED DATED 25/07/2023; NILE LODGE NURSERY PROVISION ANALYSIS JULY 2023 BY MARK POWNEY AND CALLUM HODGSON; ASBESTOS (INTRUSIVE) MANAGEMENT SURVEY BY ARISIEN LTD DATED 14/04/2023.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and Class MA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, as amended. | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage, in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards, has been provided and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Council's Waste Management Guidelines. | The site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57dB). Before the development is commenced, details shall be submitted for approval by the Council in writing, for the sound insulation of the building envelope, assessed according to the criteria specified in Section 6, Ealing Supplementary Planning Guidance 10, and not exceeding the internal noise limits for sensitive rooms in BS8233:2014. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise), in accordance with Authority's criteria. The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",

The plant noise level at non-residential noise sensitive premises at the development site and nearby shall achieve the criteria of BS 8233:2014. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/surrounding premises is not affected by noise, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), Standard 30 London Housing SPG 2016, policy D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | Prior to use, machinery, plant and equipment/extraction/ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
