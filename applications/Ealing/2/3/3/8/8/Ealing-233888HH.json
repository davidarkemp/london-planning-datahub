    "The ground floor rear extension, by reason of its depth and height along the shared boundary, would constitute an unneighbourly form of development, to the detriment of the living conditions of occupiers of the neighbouring property (9 Spencer Close) in terms of loss of outlook and a sense of enclosure. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
