    "The proposed vehicular crossover, by reason of its siting within close proximity of a well-established street tree, with no details provided assessing its impact or of any mitigation, would likely result in detrimental harm to this tree or require its removal altogether, to the detriment of the visual amenity of the street, urban greening and local ecology.  The street tree would also be visually obstructing and would pose a risk to highway safety. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies G5, G7 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), policy 5.10 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the Vehicle Crossovers: Application Pack for Residents (2021)."
