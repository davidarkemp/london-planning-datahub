    "The proposed raising of the ridge height, along with the proposed alteration of the roof from hip to gable end and rear roof extension, by reason of its height, bulk, design and scale, would constitute an overdevelopment of the host building's roof that would appear incongruous, overbearing and out of character and would unbalance the existing semi-detached pair, to the detriment of the character and visual amenity of the area.  Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
