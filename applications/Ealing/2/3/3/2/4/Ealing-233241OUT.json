    "The proposed single storey dwelling house would constitute an unsympathetic backland development that could not be accommodated  at the site without a siting, site layout and access that would be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development of the area causing harm to surrounding amenity and character. With the lack of private amenity space provided and inappropriate access, cumulatively resulting in an unsafe and a substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of potential future occupiers of the residential units, causing harm to surrounding amenity and character and setting a harmful precedent for future development. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposed residential development, by virtue of its backland location, being in close proximity to shared boundaries, separation of the plot as well as the main streetfront access being directly adjacent to the pavement, along with lack of front garden is contrary to the character and appearance of the area, therefore the building would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. It would also significantly disrupt the spatial characteristics of the area to the detriment of visual amenity. It would therefore be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | The proposed siting of the house, being set on the south, west and north boundaries, would  preclude the possibility of windows on these elevations, thereby resulting in a single aspect dwelling to the detriment of living conditions of future occupies. This would therefore cause harm and would be contrary to policies 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
