    "The proposed development, by reason of the substandard size would result in substandard amenity and living conditions for future occupants. The development is therefore contrary to the policies 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies H9, D1, D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The proposed development, by reason of its proposed formation of additional entrance door to front elevation would represent an incongruous and obtrusive addition to the host dwelling and to the detriment of the character and appearance of the street scene and the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The loss of a family sized unit and lack of appropriate housing mix in the proposal would fail to meet Ealing Council's strategic requirement for larger homes within the borough, contrary to Ealing Council's Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2022) and policies H9 and H10 of the London Plan (2021)."
