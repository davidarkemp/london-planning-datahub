    "The proposed development, by reason of the substandard ceiling height of the flat, inadequate layout to make provision for cycle parking, outdoor amenity space and refuse provision would result in substandard amenity and living conditions for future occupants. The development is therefore contrary to the policies 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies H9, D1, D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and cumulative impact would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the building's original scale and character, and which results in the overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and local area. The development would therefore fail to comply with D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The proposed development, by reason of the excessive scale would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would appear overdominant and overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties and would result in loss of outlook to the neighbour. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4.\t | Due to lack of evidence submitted, the principle of change of use from a pottery studio (Use Class E(g)) to residential (Use Class C3) fails to meet the requirements set out in Policy 4A of the Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and Policies E4 and E7 of the London Plan (2021)."
