    "The proposal by reason of its adjacent location to the telecommunications monopole and its equipment cabinet; siting on a classified road, inadequate depth and width of the forecourt which is an inadequate size to allow a vehicle to enter and exit the site in a forward gear, would result in an access arrangement that would be detrimental to pedestrian and highway safety and likely to result in a danger to highway users.  As such, the proposed development would fail to adhere to the Council's Vehicle Crossovers: Application Pack for Residents (2021), Policies D8, G7, T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 1.1 of the Ealing Local Development Framework - Adopted (Core) Strategy (2012)."
