In the case of non-compliance the legal Owner shall upon written notice from the Local Planning Authority immediately take all steps reasonably required to remedy non-compliance.",
    "a)\tWithin four weeks of planning permission being issued by the Local Planning Authority, the Owner is required to submit to the GLA accurate and verified estimates of the 'be seen' energy performance indicators, as outlined in Chapter 3 'Planning stage' of the GLA 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance document, for the consented development. This should be submitted to the GLA's monitoring portal in accordance with the 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance.",
    "b)\tOnce the as-built design has been completed (upon commencement of RIBA Stage 6) and prior to the building(s) being occupied (or handed over to a new legal owner, if applicable), the legal Owner is required to provide updated accurate and verified estimates of the 'be seen' energy performance indicators for each reportable unit of the development, as per the methodology outlined in Chapter 4 'As-built stage' of the GLA 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance. All data and supporting evidence should be uploaded to the GLA's monitoring portal. In consultation with the Council's chosen Automated Energy Monitoring Platform provider the owner should also confirm that suitable monitoring devices have been installed and maintained for the monitoring of the in-use energy performance indicators, as outlined in Chapter 5 'In-use stage' of the GLA 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance document.",
    "c)\tUpon completion of the first year of occupation following the end of the defects liability period (DLP) and for the following four years, the legal Owner is required to provide accurate and verified annual in-use energy performance data for all relevant indicators under each reportable unit of the development as per the methodology outlined in Chapter 5 'In-use stage' of the GLA 'Be seen' energy monitoring guidance document. All data and supporting evidence should be uploaded to the GLA's monitoring portal. This condition will be satisfied after the legal Owner has reported on all relevant indicators included in Chapter 5 'In-use stage' of the GLA 'Be Seen' energy monitoring guidance document for at least five years.",
    "d)\tIn the event that the in-use evidence submitted shows that the as-built performance estimates have not been or are not being met, the legal Owner should use reasonable endeavours to investigate and identify the causes of underperformance and the potential mitigation measures and set these out in the relevant comment box of the 'be seen' spreadsheet. Where measures are identified, which it would be reasonably practicable to implement, an action plan comprising such measures should be prepared and agreed with the Local Planning Authority. The measures approved by the Local Planning Authority should be implemented by the legal Owner as soon as reasonably practicable.",
    "Reason: In order to ensure that actual operational energy performance is minimised and demonstrate compliance with the 'be seen' post-construction monitoring requirement of Policy SI 2 of the London Plan."
