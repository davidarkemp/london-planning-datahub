    "The proposed front porch extension, canopy and columns, by reason of their scale, siting and design, would result in an incongruous and harmfully out of character addition to the host dwelling and would disrupt the existing uniformity between the host site and 196 Church Road, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and street scene.  As such, the proposal would fail to comply with policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and section 12 of the NPPF (2023)."
