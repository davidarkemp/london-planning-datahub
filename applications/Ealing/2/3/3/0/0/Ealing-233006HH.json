    "The development will be over-dominant and is unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to the detriment of the host dwelling and the character and appearance of the Ealing Green Conservation Area. The inaccurate drawings would also fail to achieve a satisfactory appearance. The proposal would harm the character and appearance of the Ealing Green Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2023), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the Ealing Green Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Plan (2008). | Overall, the proposed development is considered to have a significant adverse impact upon neighbouring amenities by reason of loss of light, outlook and increased feeling of enclosure, due to the scale, pitched roof profile and siting of the extension and therefore the proposal would not comply with the aims of Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021),  Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (2022) (Reg 18)."
