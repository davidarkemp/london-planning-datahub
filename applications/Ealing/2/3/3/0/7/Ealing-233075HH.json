    "The proposed extension by reason of its scale, design, siting and cumulative impact would represent an overly dominant and incongruous addition resulting in harm to the architectural integrity of the dwellinghouse and visual amenity and character of the surrounding area. As such, it fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4. | The proposed single storey rear conservatory would represent a dominant overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the residential amenity of number 7 Northcote Avenue. As such, the proposal is contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 (g) and 2.1 (c) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012."
