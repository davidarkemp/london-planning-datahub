    "1) No evidence has been provided to implicate individual trees in the alleged tree root damage. Low-rise structures, such as garden walls, driveways and footpaths, are usually constructed on shallow foundations that, over time, will distort and develop cracks and deformations. This will happen even in locations where trees are not present. Therefore, it is important that evidence is presented showing that it is, in fact, tree roots causing the damage.",
