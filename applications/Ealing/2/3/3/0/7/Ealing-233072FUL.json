    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings: Location plan; 1035 AL(02)2000 Rev 00: Existing plans; 1029 AL(02)2050 Rev 00: Existing Elevations; 1035 AL(02)2200 Rev 00: Pre-existing plans; 1029 AL(02)2250 Rev 00: Pre-existing elevations; 1035 AL(04)2100 Rev 00: Proposed plans; 1029 AL(05)2150 Rev 00:Proposed elevations; 1035 AL(04)2110 Rev 00: Block Plan;",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings listed under condition 2.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage has been provided within the curtilage of the property in accordance with the adopted standards of the Local Planning Authority. Such provision shall be brought into use prior to first occupation and retained permanently.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate refuse and recycling storage to protect the amenities of the area and the living conditions of occupiers of the proposed residential units and the surrounding area, in accordance with policy 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and policies SI8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling /wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings, namely, kitchen/dining/living/bath and shower rooms above/below bedrooms of separate dwellings and staircase adjoining bedrooms. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards of the Council's SPG10 and the criteria of BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason - To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Ealing SPG10. | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed and implemented with regard to the Council's standards in the SPG10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Any required mitigation measures shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the units and neighbouring amenity in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of the London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "| A minimum of four (4) cycle parking spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the site as indicated on the hereby approved plans listed in Condition 2, located within a secure lockable compound, prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway and pedestrian safety in accordance with policies 1.1 f of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
