    "The proposed development by reason of its excessive width, depth and overall volume would result in a dominant, overbearing and visually unsympathetic form of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and the surrounding area. The addition of a side window to gable wall and rear sliding doors with a Juliet balcony will also create a sense of overlooking and loss of privacy, impacting the residential amenity of neighbouring properties. As such the proposed development would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The submitted drawings inaccurately reflect the details, scale and design of the existing development which impacts on the assessment of the application. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
