    "The proposed residential development by reason of its unauthorised single storey rear extension and the rear canopy would be out of keeping with the pattern of development in the area, resulting in the undesirable development of the site and unacceptable impact on the visual and residential character of the locality, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed single storey rear extension and the rear canopy by reason of the cumulative depth, prominence and siting would result in a loss of light, loss of outlook, and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring property of no. 710 Greenford Road. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed residential development, by reason of its layout, undersized gross internal floor area, single aspects and poor external amenity space all of which would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation and overdevelopment of the application site, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D1, D4, D5, D6, D11 and SI1 of the London Plan (2021), policy 3.5, 7.3, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); and the London Housing SPG (2016). | The proposal would result in result in the provision of excessive off-street parking and illegal public highway crossing, will result in conditions prejudicial to highway and pedestrian safety; contrary to Policies T1, T2, T4 and T6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 2.1 and 5.3 of Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy (2012), and policy 6.13 of Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013)."
