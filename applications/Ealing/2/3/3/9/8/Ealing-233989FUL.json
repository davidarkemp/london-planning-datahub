    "The existing ground floor front extension has been built without planning permission and subjected to a planning enforcement notice, by reason of its scale, poor design and prominent location, interrupts the predominant building setback from Aintree Road, has a detrimental effect on the character and appearance of the host property, adjacent industrial building and wider Strategic Industrial Location, contrary to Policies D1, D2, E4 and E5 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of Ealing's Adopted Development Management Development Plan Document, 2013 and Policies 1.1(c) and 3.2 of the Development Strategy. | The proposal, by reason of its unregulated opening hours, odour emissions, noise and disturbance that arises from the loud, amplified music being played and coming and goings and congregation of customers, has a detrimental impact on the amenity of residential and business occupiers in the nearby vicinity, contrary to policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 1.1 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2026. Moreover, the proposal has failed to clearly demonstrate how noise and other nuisances will be mitigated and managed, contrary to policy D13 of the London Plan (2021)."
