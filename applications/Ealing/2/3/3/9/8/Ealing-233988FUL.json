    "The proposed use of the ground floor and first floor of the premises as a restaurant would result in an inappropriate, non-conforming use that would compromise the integrity and effectiveness of the Locally Strategic Industrial Location, conflicting with the aims and objectives of policies E4 and E5 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 1.1(c) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2026. | The existing external alterations of the property was made without planning permission and subjected to a planning enforcement notice, by reason of its design, appearance and materials, has a detrimental effect on the character and appearance of the host property, adjacent industrial building and wider Strategic Industrial Location, contrary to Policies D1, D2, E4 and E5 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of Ealing's Adopted Development Management Development Plan Document, 2013 and Policies 1.1(c) and 3.2 of the Development Strategy. | The use of the development, by reason of its unregulated opening hours, odour emissions, noise and disturbance that arises from the loud, amplified music being played and coming and goings and congregation of customers, has a detrimental impact on the amenity of residential and business occupiers in the nearby vicinity, contrary to policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 1.1 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2026. Moreover, the proposal has failed to clearly demonstrate how noise and other nuisances will be mitigated and managed, contrary to policy D13 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development results in an increased need for parking in an area that already faces parking pressures, to the detriment of neighbouring businesses' ability to access their unit and function effectively, as well as increases road danger to the detriment of pedestrian and cyclists' safety. In addition, there is lack of cycle parking provision within the development, contrary to Policies T1, T2, T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 3.2 of Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2026."
