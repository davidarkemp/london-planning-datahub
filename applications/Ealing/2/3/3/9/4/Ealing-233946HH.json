    "The proposed two-storey side extension and dormer roof extension would fail to harmonise with the original building, would adversely affect the dwelling's symmetry with 5 Barmouth Avenue, and would constitute an overbearing, top-heavy form of development which would be detrimental to the character of the area and the street scene. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4."
