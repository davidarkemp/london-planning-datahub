    "The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height and scale, would constitute an incongruous and over dominant additional which would fail to integrate well with the host site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider area.  The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022). | The proposed development would constitute an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities of number 14 Byron Road. As such, the proposal fails to comply with policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021)"
