    "The proposed single storey side and rear (wrap around) extension (following demolition of the existing garage) and first floor side extension would result in an overdevelopment of the dwellinghouse that would appear insubordinate to the building and out of line with the original fenestration to the detriment of the visual amenity provided by the  historic character and appearance of the building. Furthermore, the removal of the existing garage would be out of keeping with the small-scale and inconspicuous appearance",
    "characteristic of single detached garage buildings of the Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area. As is the removal of side and rear garden space and on-site trees. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to the objectives of the NPPF 2023, Policies D3, HC1, and HC4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the Generic Management Plan for Conservation Areas (2023), and the HHGE Conservation Area Management Plan (2009)."
