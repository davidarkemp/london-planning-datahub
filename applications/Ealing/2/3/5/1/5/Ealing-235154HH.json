    "The proposed side and roof extensions, by reason of their bulk, scale, depth, design, height, loss of sloped roof profile to the outrigger, and terracing effect on the streetscape would constitute an incongruous form of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the host dwelling and result in over development of the property. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 3.4 and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed glazed roof extension, by reason of its design, elevated position, and materials, would result in a loss of privacy and adverse impacts on the enjoyment of spaces and buildings for neighbouring parties at no. 25 Saville Road. The proposed development would harm the living standards of the occupants due to not being coherent and not being an appropriate level of development for the site. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies D5 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 3.5, 7B, and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
