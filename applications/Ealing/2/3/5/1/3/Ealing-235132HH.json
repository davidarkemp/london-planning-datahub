    "The proposed rear roof extension and raising of roof height, by reason of its irregular shape and bulk, would result in an incongruous and discordant form of development, resulting in an unreasonable degree of impact in terms of character and appearance to the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D4, HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
