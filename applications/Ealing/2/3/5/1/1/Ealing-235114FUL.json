Details shall demonstrate that the sound insulation value is enhanced by at least 15dB above the Building Regulations value for residential use. Where noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level shall not exceed NR20 Leq (5mins) inside habitable rooms. Details shall include the installation method and materials of separating structures and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound levels. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
