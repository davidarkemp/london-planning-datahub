    "The proposed alterations to the roof form and the proposed first-floor rear extension, by reason of its height, bulk, depth, design, scale and materials would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and terrace as a whole. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed flat, by reason of its size, floor to ceiling height and size/position of windows, would provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its position in front of a neighbouring window serving a habitable room, would adversely affect the outlook, light and privacy of this property and would fail to comply with Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
