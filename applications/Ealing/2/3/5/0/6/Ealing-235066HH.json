    "By way of its depth, height and scale, the proposed single storey and first floor rear extensions would fail to be a subordinate addition to the host dwelling and would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, to the detriment of the character, appearance and general pattern of development of the surrounding area. The proposed development would accordingly fail to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | By way of its height and depth, the proposed single storey rear and first floor rear extensions would create a sense of enclosure to no.7 East Avenue, causing a loss of light to the rear of their property and as such, having an adverse impact on their residential amenity. The development would give rise to undue overshadowing or increased sense of enclosure, therefore, it is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its impacts on neighbouring amenity and would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
