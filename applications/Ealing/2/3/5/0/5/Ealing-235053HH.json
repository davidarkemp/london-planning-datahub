    "By way of its height, depth, mass and bulk, the proposed extensions and roof alterations will result in a discordant and incongruous form of development that would erode the character of the streetscene, contributing to a dominating and overbearing presence within Birkdale Road that goes against the prevailing slope within the street. The proposed works would constitute as an illogical and excessive development to the application site which will have an adverse impact on its character and appearance.",
    "As such, it is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its scale and design and fails to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | By way of its setting, fenestrations, height and elevated position, the proposed single storey rear extension would have an adverse impact on the residential amenity of no.20 Birkdale Road, causing a loss of light to the rear of their property. The excessive height of the rear extension in conjunction with the sloping terrain would result in an unacceptable sense of overshadowing.",
    "The fenestrations proposed to the side elevation will result in a sense of overlooking and loss of privacy due to the terrain and positioning of openings.",
    "It is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its impacts on neighbouring amenity and would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
