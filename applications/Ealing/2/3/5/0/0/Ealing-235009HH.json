    "The fenestration proposed on the front elevation including the additional front door appears out of rhythm with the approved pattern of development on the front facades along the street, further exacerbated by the poorly aligned windows to the extension which further harm the character and appearance of the street scene. This is in conflict with 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021)."
