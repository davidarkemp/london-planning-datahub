    "The proposed development, due to the lack of sequential test and impact assessment, the excessive scale of the proposed restaurant and takeaway, failure to demonstrate that it would support walk-to services for SIL workers, and the resultant loss of industrial floorspace, would harm the protection, viability and integrity of the Strategic Industrial Location (SIL). Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies E4, E5 and SD7 of the London Plan 2021, policies E1, P5 and TCC1 of the OPDC Local Plan 2022 and the NPPF 2023. | The proposed development, by virtue of its unsympathetic design and expanse of shop front, would significantly alter the building's fenestration and undermine the architectural integrity of the non-designated heritage asset. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the design principles of the OPDC Local Plan 2022 and the NPPF 2023. | Inadequate information was submitted regarding transport issues (including traffic generation and flows, deliveries, servicing, parking capacity in the area, parking management within the site, disabled parking and pedestrian flows) to allow the Local Planning Authority to assess whether the application site could be rendered suitable for the use proposed, without detriment to highway and pedestrian safety. The scheme would therefore cause harm in terms of parking and highway safety and would be contrary to policies T3, T4 and T7 of the London Plan (2021), T7 of the OPDC Local Plan 2022 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
