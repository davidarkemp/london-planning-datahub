    "The proposed two storey side and rear extension and first floor rear extension, by reason of its design, scale, bulk, mass, roof profile, materials and siting in a prominent location would result in a development that is overly dominant, incongruous, and unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the host dwelling, the streetscape and the surrounding local area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) - section 12, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Draft Ealing Local Plan 2024 (Reg 19)."
