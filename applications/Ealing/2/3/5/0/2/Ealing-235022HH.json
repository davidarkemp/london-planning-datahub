    "The proposed single storey rear and side extensions, by reason of its width, depth, siting, roof profile and design, would result in the loss of special design features of the Conservation Area, would fail to respect the design and detailing of the original dwelling to the detriment of the special character of the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area. It therefore runs contrary to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3, D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Plan, the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area Policy & Design Guide (as amended 2012).",
    "| The proposed development due to its excessive scale, design, height, bulk, depth and proximity to the site boundary would constitute an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities of no.38 Woodfield Avenue. As such, the proposal fails to comply with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021)"
