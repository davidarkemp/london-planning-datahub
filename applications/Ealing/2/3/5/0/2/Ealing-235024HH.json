    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, height, and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would appear overdominant and overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties, and would result in creation of enclosure and loss of outlook to those properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
