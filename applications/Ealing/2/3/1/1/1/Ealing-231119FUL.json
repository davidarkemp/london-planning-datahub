    "The proposed extended balcony would have a detrimental impact the residential amenities of nos.26, 14 Highlands Avenue and 24 Highlands Ave (Ground floor flat) by reason of increased overlooking and loss of privacy with respect to these neighbouring gardens and be out of keeping with the pattern of development within the Highland Avenue. As such, the proposal is contrary to D1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) Ealing's Local Plan (Reg.18) policy DAA and National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - section 12. | The proposed private amenity space (the enlarged balcony) would result in increased noise and disturbance with respect to neighbouring occupants at nos.26 Highlands Avenue and Ground Floor Unit at no.24 Highlands Avenue. As such, the proposal is contrary to D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) Ealing's Local Plan (Reg.18) policy DAA and National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - section 12. | The proposed privacy screen given its height, at first floor level on adjacent to the rear garden of the neighbouring property at no.26 Highlands Avenue (Ground Floor Flat) and would result in increased feelings of enclosure with respect to the adjacent private amenity detrimental to the residential amenities of the occupier. As such, the proposal is contrary to D3 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) Ealing's Local Plan (Reg.18) policy DAA and National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - section 12."
