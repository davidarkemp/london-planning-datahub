    "The proposed development, by reason of its inappropriate scale, massing and design, would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to the detriment of the host dwelling and the character and appearance of the Ealing Cricket Ground Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the Ealing Cricket Ground Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Plan (2008)."
