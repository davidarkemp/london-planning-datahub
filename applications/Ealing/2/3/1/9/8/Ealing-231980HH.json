    "The proposal, cumulative impact given existing extensions; would result in an incongruous form of development which would be out of keeping with the appearance and character of the original dwelling and constitute over development of the site. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework 2021, London Plan (2021) Policies D3 and D4, the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) Policies 7.4 and 7B. | The proposed extensions, by reason of its scale, height and proximity to the site boundaries would constitute an overdominant and overbearing form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities of no.9 Newbury Close. As such, the proposal is contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 (g) and 2.1 (c) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012."
