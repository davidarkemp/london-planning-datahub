    "The development, by reason of its position, size, scale and materials, constitutes an intrusive, incongruous and prominent feature, out of keeping with and detrimental to the character of the area and adjacent community education and institutional uses. The development fails to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of its inappropriate use, is generating significant noise and disturbance to neighbouring properties, to the detriment of their amenity. As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DAA of Ealing's draft Local Plan (Reg 19). | The proposed development, due to its inappropriate use and location within a car park area, poses an unacceptable risk to highway safety and the safety of those using the car park. The proposed development is contrary to Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 115 of the NPPF (2023)."
