    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, in the interest of proper planning.",
    "| (A) Prior to the commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing, of plant/ machinery/ equipment/ducting/air in- and outlets/mechanical installations and their rating noise level (LAr,Tr), together with mitigation measures as appropriate. The measures shall ensure that the individual and cumulative external rating noise level will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at nearest and most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "(B) Prior to the first occupation/use of the development, a post installation sound assessment shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The assessment shall be carried out to confirm compliance with the noise criteria set out in Part A of this condition and shall include additional steps to mitigate noise as necessary. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation/ use of plant/ machinery/ equipment and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason:   To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Standard 30 of the Ealing Council's SPG 10 and policies D13, D14 of the London Plan (2021), and BS 5228-1:2009 - Code of practice for noise and vibration control on construction & open sites -Part 1: Noise'.",

The plant Noise Rating level shall not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins inside habitable rooms. Details shall include plant items and the installation method and materials of separating structures. Details of mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound level within dwellings shall be provided. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:20014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
