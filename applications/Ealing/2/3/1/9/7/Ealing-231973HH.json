    "The proposal for part first floor rear extension; alteration of main roof profile from hip to gable end and over two storey side extension; rear roof extension; and installation of three rooflights to front roof slope would be incongruous and unsympathetic with the original dwelling and broader street scape specifically the neighbouring row of semidetached dwellinghouses that the application site is part of. The proposal is considered adverse to policy that seeks the conservation and enhancement of original dwellings with particular regard to, Policy D3, D4 & HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
