    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| No part of the roof of the extension shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",
    "Reason:  To protect the living conditions of nearby properties in accordance with policies D4 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013) and policies 1.1 (e)(g), 1.2 (f), 2.1(c) and 2.10 Core Strategy (2012). | The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the approved Arboricultural Impact and Method Statement dated July 2023.",
    "Reason: To safeguard the trees in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 1.2 (d) of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012), 5.10 of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and policy G5 and G7 of the London Plan (2021). | No trees, shrubs or hedges within the site which are shown to be retained on the approved plans  shall be felled, uprooted, damaged or destroyed, cut back in any way or removed without previous written consent of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Any shrubs or hedges removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming seriously diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced with shrubs or hedge plants or similar species capable of achieving a comparable size unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.",
    "If a tree marked on the tree report to be retained is removed without consent, or dying, or being severely damaged, or becoming seriously diseased (crown more than 50% sparse), within 5 years from the start of work on the development hereby permitted, a replacement tree shall be planted on the site or surrounding area reflecting the CAVAT value of the tree, or a proportion of its value reflecting the damage. This penalty shall be sought, unless the Local Planning Authority has given written consent to any variation.",
    "Reason: to secure the protection throughout the time that development is being carried out, of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within the site which are of important amenity value to the local landscape. | The excavation near the trunk of sycamore T16 must be undertaken under the supervision of an arboricultural expert to monitor and report to the LPA on the status of the tree after completion of the development and any necessary remedial action as a result of damage incurred during construction.",
    "Reason: To ensure appropriate tree protection in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies G5 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), policy 5.10 of Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing's SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines. | Notwithstanding the information shown on the approved plans, further details of the hard and soft landscaping shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of the development. Such details shall include any new soft landscaping and surfacing materials to be used. All detailed works shall be carried out as approved following the completion of development and retained permanently thereafter. The Landscaping Plan shall also include details of the two trees shown to be felled on the approved Arboricultural Impact and Method Statement dated July 2023 which shall be replaced on site with any species chosen by the applicant. All tree planting must be carried out in full accordance with the approved details in the nearest planting season.",
    "Reason: To improve the visual amenity of the property through urban greening in accordance with policies 5.10 and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D8, G4 and G5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The detached outbuilding hereby approved shall be used only for domestic purposes incidental to the dwelling on this site, and shall not be used for separate habitable accommodation, letting or any commercial use. No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed at any time.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
