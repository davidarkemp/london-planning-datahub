    "The proposed development by reason of scale, width, height, bulk, prominence and visual impact would be an oversized, obtrusive and illogical form of development that would cause unacceptable disruption to the local roofscape and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the original building and the area. The proposed two-storey side/rear extension by reason of its design, appearance, scale and bulk would result in a form of overdevelopment of the subject site which would adversely affect the character of the original dwellinghouse as well as the character of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021)."
