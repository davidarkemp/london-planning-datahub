    "The proposed single storey rear extension, first floor rear extension, rear roof extension, and raising of main roof ridge, by reason of its combined bulk, scale and design, and the ad-hoc subdivision of the rear garden, would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the property's original scale and character, to detriment of the appearance and character of the host property and local area. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18), SPD4 Residential Extensions and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance. | The proposed single storey rear extension and first floor rear extension, by reason of its depth, bulk, scale and design would adversely affect the amenities of numbers 30-31 Hanger Lane through a harmful loss of outlook and sunlight/daylight. The inclusion of metal stairs and balustrades on the roof of the single storey rear extension would create harmful viewing angles towards neighbouring properties adversely affecting their privacy. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18). | The proposed development, by reason of the impractical layout of Unit A, the inadequate outlook and lack of privacy of bedroom 2 of Unit A, and the overlooked and insecure amenity space of Unit A, would fail to provide an acceptable level and quality of accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013)."
