    "The proposed extensions given its size, scale design and siting within this section of Montpelier Road would be out of keeping with the roofscape and cause harm to the character, appearance and pattern of development along Montpelier Road. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - section 12, policies D1, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Interim Supplementary Planning Documents SPD4 Residential Extensions.' | The proposed accommodation by reason of its inadequate communal living facilities would constitute a substandard form of self-contained residential accommodation (essentially two flats), with insufficient internal floor area and poor outlook and facilities, to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document, Policies D1, D3, D4, D6, H9,T4 of the London Plan (2021), and published Ealing Council HMO guidelines."
