    "The proposed side and rear extensions and subdivision of back garden into uncharacteristically smaller plots, by virtue of the raising of ridge level, no set down from the main house, the height and width spanning across whole rear elevation, would constitute an overbearing form of development which fails to remain subordinate to the main dwelling or respond to the established typology or urban grain in the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, and Policy 7.4 of the Ealing DPD 2013.",
    "| The cumulative impact of:",
    "- Excessive rear extensions and subdivision of the back garden,",
    "- insufficient ceiling height and GIA for flat 5,",
    "- proliferation of occupants within a moderate-sized dwelling,",
    "would represent an improper housing mix, would result in overdevelopment of the site and would fail to optimise site capacity through a design-led approach. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021; and Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing DPD 2013."
