    "The proposed single storey rear/side (wrap around) extension by reason of its bulk, mass and footprint, would result in the accumulative overdevelopment of the site and is therefore unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal is contrary policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18). | The proposed single storey rear/side (wrap around) extension by reason of its bulk, mass and scale, would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, that would create an increased sense of enclosure and harm the visual amenities of No. 51 Townsend Road. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18)."
