    "The proposed part single, part two storey side/rear extension, by reason of its contrived, awkward design in a highly prominent highly visible location, would result in a dominant, overbearing and visually harmful addition to the property to the detriment of the character, appearance of the streetscape and general pattern of development of the area. The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 and Ealing's draft Local Plan (2022)."
