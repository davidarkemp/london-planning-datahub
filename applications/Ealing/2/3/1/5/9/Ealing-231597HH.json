    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its excessive scale, footprint and design, would constitute an incongruous, un-neighbourly and unsympathetic form of development, that would fail to be ancillary to the main dwelling house, and would be at odds with the prevailing pattern of development of the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, and the visual amenities of neighbouring sites. The development would therefore run contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4."
