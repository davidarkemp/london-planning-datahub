    "The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its footprint, depth and width, would appear as an uncharacteristically bulky and overbearing form of development to the detriment of the general pattern of development and character of the Creffield Conservation Area. As such, it is contrary to policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the Creffield Conservation Area Management Plan 2007. | The proposed outbuilding, by virtue of its proximity to mature trees, would be likely to result in direct and indirect damage to the trees. The loss of these trees would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the Conservation Area and neighbours. The proposal therefore failed to take adequate account of existing landscape features that are important elements in the character and appearance of the conservation area, contrary to policies D4, HC1 and G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing development management DPD 2013."
