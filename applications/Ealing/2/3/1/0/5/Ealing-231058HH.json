    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its scale, width, height, bulk, prominence and visual impact would adversely affect the character of the original dwellinghouse as well as the character of the Cuckoo Estate Conservation Area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the Cuckoo Estate Conservation Area Management Plan/Appraisal. | The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, siting, design and particularly its oversized depth, would result in an undue increased sense of enclosure and loss of light and outlook to the neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the residential amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
