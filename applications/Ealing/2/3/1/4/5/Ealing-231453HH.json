    "The proposed two storey side and rear extension, by reason of its design, scale, bulk, mass, roof profile, materials and siting in a prominent location would result in a development that is overly dominant, incongruous, and unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to the detriment of the visual amenities of the host dwelling, the streetscape and the surrounding local area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - section 12, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Draft Ealing Local Plan 2022 (Reg 18). | The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its design, depth, bulk, design and proximity to site boundary would appear overly dominant and overbearing causing in adverse impacts on residential amenities for no. 4 Gibbon Road in terms of loss of light, loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), polices 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and the Draft Ealing Local Plan (Reg, 2022)."
