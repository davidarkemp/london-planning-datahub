    "\"Recommendations for Tree Work\" | REFUSE: T4, T5, T8,T9,T10, T11, T12 - Cutting back to the boundary line will go beyond the recommendations set out in British Standard 3998:2010 Tree Work - Recommendations, section 7.7.2.  Healthy and structurally sound trees are capable of tolerating crown reductions of 30% of leaf volume, which is detailed as approximately 12% of branch length (allowing for variation in species).  The proposed works go well beyond this maximum level and as no information has been provided to show special/exceptional reasons (subsidence damage, structural damage to the tree, etc.) for such a level of reduction the works are refused."
