    "The proposed development, by reason of its rear garden coverage and proximity to site boundaries, would represent a cramped and incongruous form of an undesirable overdevelopment, which would cause unacceptable loss of garden space, resulting in out of keeping with the general pattern of development in the area. The proposal would also provide inadequate private amenity space to serve the family dwellinghouse on the application site. Furthermore, the proposed development in conjunction with existing rear extension, by reason of its total depth, scale and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring property at 8 Bowes Road with the creation of a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to this neighbour. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPG4."
