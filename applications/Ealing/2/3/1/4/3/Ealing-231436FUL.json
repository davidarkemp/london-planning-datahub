    "The development by reason of scale, bulk, prominence and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly, dominant and overbearing development that would have an overbearing nature and lead to a loss of light, loss of outlook, and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of its height, scale, siting, proximity to boundaries and design, would represent an overbearing, illogical and dominant addition to the host site and to the detriment of the character and appearance of the local area and street scene. The development would therefore fail to comply with National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development, due to its insufficient floor to ceiling height, insufficient internal floor areas and insufficient double bedroom size for the flats would result in detrimentally substandard living conditions for prospective occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5, 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies H9, D1, D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).)"
