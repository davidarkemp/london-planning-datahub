    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its combined scale with the existing two storey side and rear extension and roof form, would cumulatively result in an overly dominant and incongruous development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property and wider area. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
