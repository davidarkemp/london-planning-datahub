    "The proposed development, by virtue of the increase in the number of occupiers along with being in close proximity to other HMO's and (large) sui generis HMO's, would be considered an over intensification of the plot and overconcentration of HMO's within the surrounding area. When coupled with the other nearby HMO's the increase in the number of occupiers on the site would be readily noticeable. This is therefore contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proposed layout by reason of the lack of communal space, coupled with narrow bedrooms, and the siting of the proposed bike stores in front of bedroom windows, would provide substandard accommodation for future occupiers lacking in amenity space and privacy. This would cause harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers and would be contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D6 and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
