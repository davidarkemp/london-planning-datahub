    "The proposed development by reason of its design, proximity to site boundary and excessive depth at first floor rear would represent an overly dominant and incongruous development resulting in undue harm to the visual amenity and character of the street scene and surrounding area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Interim Planning Guidance SPD4 and Ealing Design Guidance (2022). | The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, depth, roof profile and proximity to site boundary would result in an overbearing and dominant development that would lead to a loss of light, outlook and increased sense of enclosure to the neighbouring property number 53 Ashness Gardens. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed by neighbouring properties would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
