    "The proposed roof extension, by reason of its bulk, design, siting around the proposed first floor side extension and height above predominant massing of the roof and visibility from the street, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, that would cause significant detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the building and the surrounding area, as well as the visual amenity of the street scene. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan, Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and SPD4 (Residential Extensions).",
    "| The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of a lack of setback from the front elevation would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development that would fail to achieve subordination with the host dwelling. Due to their scale, appearance, cumulative impact and terracing effect would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing properties within the terrace and would be harmful to the visual amenities of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - section 12, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Draft Ealing Local Plan 2022 (Reg 18)."
