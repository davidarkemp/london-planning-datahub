    "The proposed housing mix, by virtue of loss of family-sized dwellings and proliferation of one-bedroom units would conflict with the Council's strategic market housing needs. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy H10 of the London Plan 2021, Ealing Local Housing Needs Assessment Update 2022 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The proposed rear roof terraces and timber fencing, by virtue of their footprint, height and siting, would constitute alien features within the area and give rise to undue loss of daylight and increased sense of enclosure at no.1 and no.3 St Augustines Avenue, to the detriment of character of the area and neighbouring amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Standard 32 of the Housing SPG 2016, and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The submitted drawings failed to demonstrate the accurate dimensions of the part first floor rear extension at no.1 St Augustines Avenue. The extension as shown on the submitted plans, by virtue of its excessive depth and width, would not remain subservient to the host building or respect the 45-degree rule, to the detriment of the architectural integrity of the main house and daylight and sunlight conditions for occupants at no. 3 St Augustines Avenue. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Standard 32 of the Housing SPG 2016, and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The front porch extensions, by virtue of unprovided proposed elevation plans, would fail to demonstrate their design impact on the host buildings and the street scene. As such, the proposal is contrary with Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The cumulative impact of:",
    "-\tProliferation of single-bedroom units",
    "-\tContrived internal room arrangements",
    "-\tNo passive ventilation and nature daylight for the kitchen area of flat 1",
    "-\tNo demonstration of avoidance of overheating for single-aspect units",
    "-\tInappropriate vertical arrangement of bedrooms adjoining/ above/ below kitchen/dining/living/bathrooms",
    "-\tThe majority of bedrooms located next to the main highway and exposed to traffic noise and poor air quality",
    "would lead to poor living conditions for future occupants, would represent an improper housing mix, and would fail to optimise site capacity through a design-led approach. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing DPD 2013.",
    "| The proposed rear car parking spaces, by virtue of the limited width of the side and back alleyway, would not provide adequate manoeuvrability within the site to enable vehicles exit in a forward gear, to the detriment of highway safety. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies T3 and T4 of the London Plan 2021."
