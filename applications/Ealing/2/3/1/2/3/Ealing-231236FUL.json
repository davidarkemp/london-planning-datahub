    "The submitted drawings have failed to demonstrate satisfactory plans for the planning assessment such as the full elevations of the proposed outbuilding. The submitted drawing also fail to match with the approved drawing of the rear elevation of 213806FUL dated 06/08/2021 which is considered as misrepresentations. As such, the proposed development, by reason of the inaccurate and insufficient plans submitted would cause harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. The Council is unable to fully assess the proposed development and in the absence of accurate and consistent details it is considered that the proposed development would be inconsistent with the objectives of Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
