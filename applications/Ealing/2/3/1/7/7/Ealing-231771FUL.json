    "The proposed rear extension and roof terrace, by virtue of their footprint, siting, and design, would constitute overbearing, ad-hoc and out of keeping additions to host building, to the detriment of the overall pattern of development in the Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to the London Plan (2021) policies D3, D4 and HC1, the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4, 7B and 7C, Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022 and SPD4. | The proposed roof terrace and external staircase, by virtue of their size and siting, would represent an unneighbourly and unsympathetic form of development to the detriment of privacy of adjacent neighbours and the ground floor occupant. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by virtue of contrived layout arrangement and site access, would fail to provide adequate daylight, privacy and usable GIA for flat A or a safe and ease assess for flat B, to the detriment of living conditions for future occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D6 and D11 of the London Plan 2021."
