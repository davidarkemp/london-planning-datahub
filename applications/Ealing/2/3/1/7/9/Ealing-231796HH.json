    "The proposed vehicular crossover by reason of its siting within close proximity of a well-established street tree, with no details provided assessing its impact or of mitigation, would most likely result in detrimental impacts on the tree to the detriment of the visual amenity of the area. It has also not been demonstrated that the crossover would achieve 1.2m visibility splays no visual obstructions above 1.6m in height. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies G7, T3 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 5.10 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), The Vehicle Crossovers: Application Pack for Residents (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
