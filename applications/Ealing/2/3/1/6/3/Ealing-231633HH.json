    "The proposed roof extensions by reason of their scale, width, height, bulk, prominence and visual impact would be an oversized, obtrusive form of development that would cause unacceptable disruption to the local roofscape and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and the local area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
