    "The proposal, which involves the subdivision of a dwelling into a flat that is below the sizes required in the Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard (2015) and would result in a substandard accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. The proposal would fail to comply with Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard (2015), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 3.5 of the Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The proposed outbuilding, by reason or its size, separate access to the street, and access to private garden, would fail to be functionally ancillary to Flat B and is considered as its own independent planning unit. The outbuilding would therefore fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its height, depth and proximity to the boundary, would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, loss of early morning sunlight and overshadowing in the garden at Number 111 Hicks Avenue. The proposal would fail to protect the living conditions of occupants of nearby properties in accordance with Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed fenestration on the front elevation, including the installation of four doors, would appear incongruous, would detract from the character and the appearance of the building and would fail to positively impact the local spatial character. The proposal would fail to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed cycle parking for Flat B would not be practical or well-located given the small internal space proposed. The proposal would fail to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021)."
