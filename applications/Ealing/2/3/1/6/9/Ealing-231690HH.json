    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area, harmful to the original characters of the host dwellinghouse and cause detrimental impact to the street scene. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
