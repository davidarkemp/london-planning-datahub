    "The proposed development, by reason of its design, appearance, excessive width, height and scale, would result in a development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to detriment of the appearance and character of the host dwellings and the historic character of the Grange and White Ledges Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Grange and White Ledges Conservation Area Character Appraisal (2000) and Grange and White Ledges Conservation Area Management Plan (2009)."
