    "The proposal for a single storey rear infill extension and rooflight; rear roof extension; installation of one rooflight to front roofslope; and associated internal and external alterations would be incongruous with both the original host dwelling and the broader terrace. The proposal is considered adverse to policy that seeks the conservation and enhancement of original dwellings with particular regard to, Policy D3, D4 & HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the St Marks and Canal conservation area management plan 5.6(6) Extension and porches. | The single storey rear infill extension would introduce 5 metres of built form at 3 metres in height along the shared boundary with number 14 St Andrews Road. The proposal would fail to ensure a high amount of amenity for the adjoining neighbour at number 14 St Andrews Road who have a number of windows adjacent the proposed extension. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 & D6 of the London Plan (2021) along with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
