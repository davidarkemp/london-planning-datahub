    "The proposed conservatory extension, by reason of its depth, height and design, would constitute an incongruous and dominant feature which would fail to integrate well with the host building. The extension would fail to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed conservatory extension, by reason of its scale, height and proximity to the site boundaries would constitute an overdominant and overbearing form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities of the adjoining property. The extension would fail to comply with Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
