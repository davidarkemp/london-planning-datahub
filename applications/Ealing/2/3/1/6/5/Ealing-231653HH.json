    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, size and scale, would result in a dominant, overbearing and insubordinate addition to the property, to the detriment of the character, design and general pattern of development of the area. The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework 2023 (2023) sections 12 and 16, policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's Local Plan (Reg.18), the Ealing Cricket Ground Conservation Area Management Plan, Generic Conservation Area Management Plan and Ealing Cricket Ground Addendum 2023"
