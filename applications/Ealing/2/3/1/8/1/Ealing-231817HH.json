    "The proposed development by way of its design, scale, appearance and width at the first-floor rear elevation would constitute an unduly dominant overdevelopment to the detriment of the architectural integrity and character of the subject dwellinghouse and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its scale and design and fails to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4. | The proposed development by way of its excessive depth to the rear would result in an undue amenity impact to the adjoining property at no. 16 through a loss of light and outlook and an increased sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the residential amenity of that property. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4."
