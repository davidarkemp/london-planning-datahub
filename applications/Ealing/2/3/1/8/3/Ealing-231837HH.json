    "The proposed basement excavation, by reason of its depth, scale, siting, proximity to boundaries, design and cumulative impact would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the building's original scale and character, and which results in the overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and local area. The development would therefore fail to comply with D3, D4 and D10 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The proposed development, by reason of its rear garden coverage and proximity to site boundaries, would represent a cramped and incongruous form of development on this site to cause unacceptable loss of garden space, resulting in out of keeping with the general pattern of development in the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | A Construction Management Plan (CMP) has not been provided for the proposed basement excavation. Given the size of the basement, it is considered that the excavation would result in an unacceptable impact on neighbour's amenity due to the prolonged disruption from noise, vibration, dust and spoil removal. The proposal fails to comply with Policy D10 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of its design and fenestration detail, would be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area without screening, which would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would cause overlooking and loss of privacy to those properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
