    "The proposed development, by reason of its cumulative scale and unsympathetic design, represents an overbearing and incongruous addition to the host dwelling, that is at odds with the prevailing pattern of development of the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and street scene, and the visual amenities of neighbouring sites. The development would therefore run contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4."
