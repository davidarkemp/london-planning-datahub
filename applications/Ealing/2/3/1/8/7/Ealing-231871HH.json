    "The proposed roof terrace above the first floor, would give rise to the potential for direct overlooking of the neighbouring property, causing an impact on the residential amenity of no. 143 Acton Lane by way of overlooking and loss of privacy. As such, the proposal is contrary to  Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4. | The proposed development by way of its excessive depth to the side and rear would result in an undue amenity impact to the adjoining property at no.143 though loss of light and an increased sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the residential amenity of that property. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with the objectives of the  Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4. | The proposed development, by reason of its plot coverage and proximity to site boundaries, would represent a cramped and incongruous form of development on the application site, out of keeping with the general pattern of development in the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4."
