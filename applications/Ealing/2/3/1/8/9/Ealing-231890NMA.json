    "The proposed removal of rooflight for ground bedroom 2 and rooflight for second floor bathroom would adversely impact the lighting condition and direct ventilation of the rooms to the detriment of future occupants' living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to the aim of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013. The proposed amendments therefore cannot be treated as a non-material amendment to planning permission Ref.
