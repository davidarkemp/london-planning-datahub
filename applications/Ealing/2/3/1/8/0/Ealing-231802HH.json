    "The proposed development, combined with the existing extension,  by reasons of the height, depth, massing and design, would represent incongruous bulk and mass to the original dwelling that would adversely affect the appearance as viewed from the streetscene. The application site would appear overdeveloped and would not appreciate the character of the original built form of the host dwellinghouse and neighbouring properties. As such, the development is contrary to polices D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing's Adopted DPD (2013)."
