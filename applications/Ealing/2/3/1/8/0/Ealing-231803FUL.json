    "The proposed development, by reason of the bulk, mass, scale, footprint and design, would result in an ad-hoc and incongruous form of development, and an overdevelopment of the plot, that would fail to harmonise with its surroundings, to the detriment of local character and appearance. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18). | The proposed development, by reason of the bulk, mass, scale, footprint and design, would result in an increased sense of enclosure, overbearing impact, overlooking, reduced sense of privacy, overshadowing and loss of light for occupiers of neighbouring properties, and a sense of insecurity for those that utilise the existing public access route between Northfield Avenue and Derwent Road, to the detriment of neighbour amenity and living conditions. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18). | The proposed development, by reason of the inadequate outlook for occupiers of Units 1, 3, 4 and 5, lack of defensible space for occupiers of the KLD of Unit 3 and Bedroom 1 of Unit 4, substandard amenity space for occupiers of Units 3, 4 and 5, insufficient kitchen/living/dining space for occupiers of Units 1 and 4, a sense of insecurity due to the inappropriate access arrangement, absence of sectional drawings to demonstrate sufficient headroom height and inadequate and insecure cycle parking storage would fail to provide an acceptable level and quality of accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the London Plan Guidance Housing Design Standards LPG (2023). | The proposed development, by reason of the inadequate and insecure cycle parking storage, would not help remove barriers to cycling and create a healthy environment in which future occupiers choose to cycle, to the detriment of sustainable transport. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and London Cycling Design Standards (2014)."
