    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of its height, width, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous, overbearing and obtrusive addition to the building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), EALING Housing Design Guidance 2022, and SPD4. | The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, height, siting, and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would result in creation of enclosure and overshadow, loss of outlook and loss of daylight/sunlight to the neighbouring properties (41 and 43 Lavington Road). As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
