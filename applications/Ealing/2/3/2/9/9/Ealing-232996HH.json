    "The proposed basement excavation, by reason of its depth, scale, siting, proximity to boundaries, design and cumulative impact would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the building's original scale and character, and which results in the overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and local area. The development would therefore fail to comply with D3, D4 and D10 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The proposed garage by reason of scale, depth, siting and proximity to boundaries would cumulatively result in an incongruous development which would represent a cramped form of overdevelopment of the site to the detriment of the character and appearance of the property. The development would therefore be contrary policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
