    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its scale and siting would create a dominating presence within the application site and would diminish the prominence of the original dwelling, causing its width to be enlarged substantially as a result. The proposed development is unsympathetic to the original dwelling and constitutes an incongruous addition to the application site. Therefore, this application fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
