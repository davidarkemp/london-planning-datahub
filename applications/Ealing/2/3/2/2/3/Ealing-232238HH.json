The development fails to comply with the NPPF (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), polices 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and the Brentham Garden Estate  Conservation Area Management Plan."
