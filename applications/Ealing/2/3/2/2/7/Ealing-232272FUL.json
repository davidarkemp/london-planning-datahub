    "The proposed development, by virtue of its close distance to the existing building onsite and the rear balconies, would result in undue loss of privacy, light and outlook and increased sense of enclosure to the detriment of the residential amenities of adjacent properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) in terms of residential amenity. | The proposed development, by virtue of lack of façade articulation, provision of an inclusive site access and its combined bulk and scale with the existing building onsite, would constitute an incongruous and overdominant form of development to the detriment of the streetscene and pattern of development of the area. As such, it is contrary with Policies D3, D4, and D5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development DPD 2013. | The proposed housing mix, together with the extant prior approval onsite, would lead to a proliferation of small units and would fail to optimise site capacity taking into account local housing need and infrastructure availability. As such, the proposal is contrary with paragraph 124 of the NPPF and Policy H10 of the London Plan 2021. | The proposed development, by virtue of inadequate GIA, lack of dedicated private amenity spaces, lack of privacy for ground floor bedroom, inadequate refuse storage and inaccessible cycle storage, would fail to provide a satisfactory level of living condition for future occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the nationally described space standard 2015."
