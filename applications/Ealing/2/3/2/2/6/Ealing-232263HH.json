    "The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension; first floor side extension; and conversion of garage into a habitable room and front garage extension in line with the proposed porch. By reason of the front garage extension and porch protruding forward of the existing front façade and bay window is a design that is unsympathetic and insubordinate to the existing front façade of the dwellinghouse and is contrary to the existing design and layout of the neighbouring dwellings to the application site. As such, the proposal is contrary with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Chapter 12, the London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, and the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B."
