    "The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height and proximity to the site boundary would constitute an over dominant and overbearing form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities of the occupiers of 14 Byron Road.  The extension would fail to comply with Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).\t | The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive depth, width and design, would constitute an incongruous and over dominant additional which would fail to integrate well with the host site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider area.  The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
