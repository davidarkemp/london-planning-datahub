    "The first-floor rear extension and rear roof extension, by reason of their combined scale, size, bulk, mass and design would result in an incongruous development which over dominates and is unsympathetic to the property's original scale and character, to the detriment of the host property and local area. As such the proposal fails to adhere to policy that seeks the conservation and enhancement of original dwellings with particular regard to, Policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
