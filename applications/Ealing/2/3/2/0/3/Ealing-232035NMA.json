    "Prior to commencement of the development (excluding site clearance) hereby approved, a detailed surface water drainage design and detailed maintenance plan in accordance with the submitted Flood Risk Assessment & Drainage Strategy, March 2021, issue 2 and appendices by Cole Easdon shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the council, according to the following criteria:",
    "(i) The drainage system must be designed to control runoff up to a 1 in 100 year storm event.",
    "(ii) The rate at which surface water is discharged from the site may vary with the severity of the storm event but must not exceed the greenfield runoff rate for a given storm event.",
    "(iii) Excess surface water runoff must be stored on site and released to receiving watercourses at greenfield rates.",
    "(iv) Surface water discharges to watercourses must not have greater velocity than 1 m/s.",
    "Submitted details shall also include a site specific ground investigation with accompanying engineering drawings and borehole scan results; aground investigation with sketched structural details which specify the depth and arrangement of foundations; an assessment of basement (lower ground floor) impacts on drainage with flooding from all sources (surface water and ground water impacts); ground water conditions and structural stability where appropriate shall be included to ensure the development does not result in flooding or ground instability",
    "Reason: To ensure the development does not result in flooding or ground instability elsewhere by ensuring that sufficient storage of surface flood water is provided and achieved with appropriate sustainable drainage techniques, in accordance policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012); policy 5.12 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013); policies SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan(2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
