    "The proposed alterations to the front fa√ßade of the dwellinghouse are deemed to include inappropriate materials causing unacceptable visual prominence of the application site. The unlawful development appears incongruous with the appearance and design of the original dwellinghouse. The unlawful development undermines and diminishes the character and appearance of the property, harms the visual amenities of neighbouring properties and fails to preserve the character or appearance of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area. As such, the unlawful development conflicts with aims and objectives of policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of Ealing's Adopted Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Appraisal (2008) and Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Management Plan (2008) which collectively promote high quality design that is appropriate to its context and seek to preserve the significance of heritage assets. The unlawful development further conflicts with the National Planning Policy Framework which requires that great weight should be given to the conservation of heritage assets."
