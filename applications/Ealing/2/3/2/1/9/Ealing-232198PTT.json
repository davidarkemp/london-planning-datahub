    "1)  x3 replacement trees must be planted by April 2024 near the site but on the artificial grass; the trees should be of similar species of any fruiting tree, preferably native",
    "2) Failure to do so will result in a tree replacement notice under section 207 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "3) It is recommended that planting takes place between the months of October and March but be careful to avoid periods of waterlogging or hard frost",
    "4) If the new tree's species is different from that removed, then Ealing's Planning department must be consulted before planting is completed. | T1 Cedar: It is evident that the tree is sparse because of previous landscaping works, including the artificial grass. The tree is most likely suffering due to excessive compaction of the soil. The best solution is to aerate the soil to improve its health and monitor the tree's health."
