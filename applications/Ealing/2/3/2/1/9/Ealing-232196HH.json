    "The proposed development, by reason of its removal of special interest features and installation of contemporary and uncharacteristic building materials and landscaping, would not conserve, retain, or enhance the significance of the conservation area or be sympathetic to the historical assets and their surroundings, nor would it maintain design quality of the property and local context. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to London Plan Policies D1, D4, and HC1, the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) Policies 7.4 and 7C, Draft Generic Management Plan (2022), Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area Appraisal (2009), and Hanger Hill Garden Estate Area Management Plan (2009). | The proposed development, by reason of removing vegetation and garden beds between the dwelling and the highway and installing an extensive impermeable hard-stand area, would result in a net loss of amenity and not take a sustainable approach to drainage in domestic gardens and open space. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004) Policies 5.10 and 5.12. | The proposed development, by reason of installing a heat pump within 1 metre of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and not sited to minimise its effect on the amenity of the area and the external appearance of the building, would erode the amenity and attractiveness of the surrounding uses and the site itself. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to London Plan Policy D14 and the adopted Ealing Unitary Development Plan, 'Plan for the Environment' (2004), Policy 7A."
