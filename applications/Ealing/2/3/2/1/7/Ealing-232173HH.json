    "The proposal, by virtue of the alteration to existing front roof profile and the height, scale and design of the two storey side-extension, would constitute a discordant and overbearing form of development which does not respect the architectural integrity or remain subservient to the main house, to the detriment of street scene and character of the area. As such, the proposal would not comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Ealing Housing Desing Guidance 2022 and SPD4."
