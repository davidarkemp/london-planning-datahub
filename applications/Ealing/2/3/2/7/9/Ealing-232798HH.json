    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its design, siting and roof form, would result in an incongruous addition to the host dwelling, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and visual amenity of neighbouring residents.  As such, the proposal would fail to comply with policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SDP4 - Residential extensions and section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
