    "The proposed use of the existing outbuilding, due to its scale, internal layout, siting along a shared access path to the rear, and independent access to a highway would not reasonably be related to the ground floor flat and would constitute a self-contained dwelling. The proposed dwelling, by reason of its insufficient gross internal area (GIA), lack of sufficient outlook, lack of private amenity space, and inappropriate access, would result in a cramped and substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the Mayors Housing SPG (2016). | The existing outbuilding's side window, by way of its siting right on the shared boundary with number 199 Windmill Lane, would give rise to the direct overlooking of the neighbouring property and would constitute unneighbourly development, to the detriment of the residential amenity of occupiers of this neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
