    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension on the hip and the side dormer roof extension would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site. Both extensions would constitute incongruous additions out of keeping with and detrimental to the character of the Acton Green Conservation Area and with clear views from the street. The development would fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed single storey side/rear extension would fail to harmonise with the original building and would adversely affect the dwelling's symmetry and relationship with the street. The extension would fail to contribute positively to the existing and emerging spatial character of the Acton Green Conservation Area. The development would fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development does not follow the standing advice published by the Environment Agency and Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs - Preparing a flood risk assessment: standing advice (2012). The applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development is appropriate for the level of flood risk to the site. The submission has not demonstrated compliance with Paragraph 164 of the NPPF (2023), Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy 5.12 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
