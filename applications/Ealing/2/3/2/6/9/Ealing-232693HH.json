    "The proposal, by virtue of the height, depth, design, roof profile and combined bulk of the extensions as well as lack of depiction of the details of windows and doors, would constitute an incongruous and insubordinate form of development to the detriment of the street scene of the Conservation Area and architectural integrity of the main house. As such, it is contrary to Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the Mount Park Conservation Area Management Plan 2009. | The proposed extensions, by virtue of their proximity to mature trees and in the absence of a tree protection plan, would be likely to result in direct and indirect damage to the trees. The loss of these trees would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the Conservation Area and neighbours. The proposal therefore failed to take adequate account of existing landscape features that are important elements in the character and appearance of the conservation area, contrary to policies D4, HC1 and G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing development management DPD 2013 and the Mount Park Conservation Area Management Plan 2009."
