    "The proposed residential development, by virtue of its scale, design, basic elevational treatment, its erosion of the space between 20 and 22 St Andrews Road and relationship with its context would be out of character with the established pattern of development in the area, therefore, would be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the existing property and the surrounding area contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D1, D4, D5 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing DPD 2013 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The proposed development, by virtue of the unproportioned elevational treatment of the front, its significant protrusion of building line and lack of facade articulation along St Andrews Road, would appear as a bulky and visually unattractive building along the road. Weighing against paragraph 134 of the NPPF2021, the proposal is considered neither in accordance with the Council's Design Code nor represent outstanding or innovative designs. As such would be materially harmful to the character and appearance of the area and street scene. contrary to section 12 of the NPPF, Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policy 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing DPD 2013 and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022."
