    "The proposed roof extensions, due to their scale, appearance, cumulative impact and terracing effect would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the existing properties within the terrace and would be harmful to the visual amenities of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - section 12, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Draft Ealing Local Plan 2022 (Reg 18). | The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale and extent of development within this plot, would constitute an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, to the detriment of the visual amenity of occupiers of no.69 Darwin Road. As such, it is contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B  of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
