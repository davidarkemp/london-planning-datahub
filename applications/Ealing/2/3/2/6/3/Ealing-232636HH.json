    "The proposed building, by reason of its excessive height, scale, bulk, siting and design, would result in an overbearing and unsympathetic form of development that would fail to harmonise or integrate well into its rear garden setting, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers at 152 Allenby Road.  As such, the proposal would fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed building, due to its scale, internal layout and siting along a shared access path to the side and rear, would constitute a two-bedroom self-contained dwelling. The proposed dwelling, by reason of its insufficient gross internal area (GIA), insufficient size of bedrooms (both being single bedrooms), and insufficient floor to ceiling height, and amenity of future occupiers of the would result in a cramped and substandard form of accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions dwelling. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
