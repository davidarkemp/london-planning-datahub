    "The proposed changes to the roof design would introduce an incongruous and awkward roof form that would be out of keeping with the approved pattern of development in the area, contrary to policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). Therefore it is considered that the proposal does not fall within the provisions of s73 of the Town and Country Planning Act or the Council's Protocol for Minor Material Amendments."
