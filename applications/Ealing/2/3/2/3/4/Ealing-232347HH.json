    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their, height, bulk, width depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area. The proposed rear extensions, by reason of its excessive width, depth, would constitute overdevelopment of the application site, that would be against the prevailing pattern of development and cause harm to the character and appearance of the area.  As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
