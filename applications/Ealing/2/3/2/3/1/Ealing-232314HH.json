    "The proposed part single part two storey by reason of its scale, width, height, bulk, prominence and visual impact would constitute an incongorus and over-dominant addition, adversely affecting the architectural integrity of the original dwellinghouse as well as the special and historic character of the Haven Green Conservation Area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D4, and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the Haven Green Conservation Area Management Plan/Appraisal. | The proposed part single part two storey rear extension, by reason of its depth, width, height, and scale at first floor level, would represent an unneighbourly and overbearing form of development and would result in a loss of sunlight/daylight to habitable room windows and a loss of privacy from direct overlooking, all to the detriment of the amenity of occupiers of 2 Madaley Road. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D1, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development by reason of its removal of a tree, with no details provided assessing its impact or of mitigation, would result in detrimental impacts to the character of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D4, G7 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 5.10, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the Haven Green Conservation Area Management Plan/Appraisal."
