    "The proposed hip to gable roof extension, by reason of its design, would result an inharmonious and discordant addition to the street scene and the architectural design of the host building as well as the properties on the same side of the street, to the detriment of the character, appearance and design of the host building and the conservation area. The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4, Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022), Ealing Green Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and Generic Management Plan for Conservation Areas (2023)."
