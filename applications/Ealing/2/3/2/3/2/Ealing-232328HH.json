    "The proposed development by way of its siting of a self-contained residential unit within an outbuilding in a backland location and an ad-hoc subdivision of the site and access, would constitute an incongruous and disjointed development that is at odds with the established pattern of development of the area, resulting in undue harm to surrounding amenity and character and setting a harmful precedent for future development. As such, it is contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The proposed development by way of its poor outlook, daylight and sunlight provision, being single aspect and insufficient private amenity space would provide substandard accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers. As such, it is contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), The Technical Housing Standards and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
