    "By way of its scale, siting and appearance, the proposed basement and its corresponding lightwells would pose an incongruous and inappropriate development to the site, deviating away from the character of the existing street scene and surrounding neighbours.",
    "The proposed front light well and platform to the ground floor front door will cause a loss in symmetry and will diminish the appearance of the site through its poor design and appearance within the street scene.",
    "As such, this application is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) as well as policies D4 and D5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "| By reason of its poor outlook, lighting and privacy conditions, the proposed basement would provide substandard living conditions for future residents. The proposed unit would experience inadequate light conditions, with poor outlook of the lightwell and heightened risk of loss of privacy. The lightwell's siting in relation to the street scene and the proposed access platform would provide a clear view into the master bedroom and living room of the proposed unit.",
    "The size of the lightwell would provide poor outlook with insufficient lighting conditions, specifically to the proposed bedrooms and living room, additionally, a daylight/sunlight survey has not been provided demonstrating sufficient lighting conditions.",
    "There are no windows proposed to the kitchen area, proving extremely poor lighting and ventilation to that area of the property, which is contrary to the BRE Guidance.",
    "As such, this application fails to comply with the BRE Guidance, Policies 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) as well as Policies D4, D5 and D6 of the London Plan 2021. | The proposed basement, located within a minor ground water vulnerability area which is also susceptible to ground water flooding, has failed to demonstrate sufficient and safe living conditions for future residents.",
    "The proposal will constitute as an overdevelopment within the application site and would be detrimental to the safety and living conditions of the existing and future residents.",
    "As such, this proposal is contrary to Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
