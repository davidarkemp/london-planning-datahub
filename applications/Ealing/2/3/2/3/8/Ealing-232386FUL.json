    "The proposal by reason of its siting, location, scale and positioning would represent a cramped, incongruous and over-developed form of development that is out of keeping with and harmful to the established pattern of development and character of the area and would set a harmful precedent for infill developments of a similar nature. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD, and Sections 11 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The proposal by way of insufficient and poor quality external amenity space, poor light penetration and outlook would provide substandard accommodation and cycle storage for future occupiers to the detriment of their residential amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, and policies 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013. | By reason of its siting, footprint and overall scale, the development would appear unduly overbearing from Nos. 2-4 Sunningdale Avenue and unacceptably reduce, enclose and overshadow the private amenity areas of these dwellings to the detriment of their residential amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013."
