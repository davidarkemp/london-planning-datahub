    "The proposed crossover, by reason of its excessive width, the inadequate depth and width of the forecourt which is insufficient to allow a vehicle to enter and exit the site in a forward gear, and its location on a classified road, would result in an access arrangement that would be detrimental to highway and pedestrian safety and likely to result in a danger to highway and pedestrian users, and would exacerbate parking congestion along this road. As such, the proposed development would fail to adhere to the Council's Vehicle Crossovers: Application Pack for Residents (2021), Policies D8, T3 and T4 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 1.1 of the Ealing Local Development Framework - Adopted (Core) Strategy (2012)."
