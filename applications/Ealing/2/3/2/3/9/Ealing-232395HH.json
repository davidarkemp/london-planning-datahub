    "The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension; alteration of roof from hip to gable ends (hip to gable on both sides); rear roof extension to main rear roof slope (dormer); raising of the ridge height and construction of balcony to first and second floor rear elevations, by virtue of their cumulative bulk, scale and design would constitute an incongruous, unneighbourly and unsympathetic form of development to the detriment of the architectural integrity of the hot building and neighbouring residential amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Chapter 12, the London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, and the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B."
