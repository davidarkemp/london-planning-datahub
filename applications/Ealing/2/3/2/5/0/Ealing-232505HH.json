    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of scale, bulk, prominence and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development that would have an overbearing nature and lead to a loss of light, loss of outlook, and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring property (33 Rosemont Road). As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
