    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive width, design and siting within the roofscape, and lack of separation, would result in an incongruous addition to the host dwellings, which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to both dwelling's original scale and character, to detriment of the appearance of both dwellings and the character, appearance, and significance of the Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area. The proposal would lead to less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the CA. There would be no public benefit arising from the proposal to outweigh the harm identified. As such, the proposal is contrary to Paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 18) and the Hanger Hill Garden Estate Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Plan (2009)."
