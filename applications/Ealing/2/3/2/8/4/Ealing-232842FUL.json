    "Design and Access Statement, 083.02.01, 083.02.02, 083.02.03, 083.02.04, 083.02.05, Tree Survey, Arboricultural Impact Assessment by Hydens Arboricultural Consultants dated 19/10/2023 and email dated 04/12/2023.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.",
    "| The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with the provisions of Section 18 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, as amended, to prevent the accumulation of unimplemented listed building consents and to enable the Local Planning Authority to review the situation at the end of this period if the development has not begun.",
    "| No operations (including initial site clearance) shall commence on site in connection with development hereby approved until all tree protection methods detailed in the approved  Arboricultural Method Statement shall be installed prior to commencement of the development including site clearance and shall not be moved or removed, temporarily or otherwise, until all works including external works have been completed and all equipment, machinery and surplus materials have been removed from the site, unless the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority has first been sought and obtained.",
    "Reason: To ensure appropriate tree protection in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies G5, G6 and G7 of the London Plan, policy 5.10 of Ealing's Development Management DPD and Ealing's SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines.",

    "Any trees, shrubs or hedges removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming seriously diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced with shrubs or hedge plants or similar species capable of achieving a comparable size unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.",
    "The local authority shall receive the full CAVAT value, or a proportion reflecting the damage /decline in tree health, for all trees: removed without consent, or dying, or being severely damaged, or becoming seriously diseased (crown more than 50% sparse), within 5 years from the start of work on the development hereby permitted. This financial penalty shall be sought, unless the Local Planning Authority has given written consent to any variation.",
    "Reason: to secure the protection throughout the time that development is being carried out, of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within the site which are of important amenity value to the local landscape, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D1, D4, HC1, G5, G6 and G7 of the  London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
