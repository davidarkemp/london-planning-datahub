    "The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, height, and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of Number 125 Wells House Road. The proposed development would appear overdominant and overbearing when viewed from neighbouring property, and would result in a sense of enclosure, loss of light and loss of outlook. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | Furthermore, the proposed first floor flat, by reason of the inappropriately sized single bedroom at first floor level and lack of dedicated private amenity space would provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy D3 of the OPDC Local Plan (2022), policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard (2015). | The proposed development would fail to provide safe, secure cycle parking and would fail to provide the correct amount of cycle parking (four spaces). The development would fail to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021)."
