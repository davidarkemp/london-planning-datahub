    "The proposed side extension by reason of its design, siting, scale and excessive height and depth at ground floor level would represent an overly dominant and incongruous development resulting in undue harm to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Interim Planning Guidance SPD4 and Ealing Design Guidance (2022).",
    "| The proposed side extension, by reason of its depth and height along the shared boundary, and scale, would represent an unneighbourly and overbearing form of development and would result in a loss of sunlight/daylight to habitable room windows of the neighbouring property and an undue sense of enclosure, all to the detriment of the amenity of occupiers of 16 Conolly Road. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D1, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
