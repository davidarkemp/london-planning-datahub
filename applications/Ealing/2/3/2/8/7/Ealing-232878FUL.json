    "The existing hardstanding surface and refuse storage space, by virtue of the design, appearance and scale, would be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the area and as such would constitute an inappropriate form of development. The proposal would fail to preserve the character of the conservation area and would therefore be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7C and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Creffield Conservation Area Management Plan and Appraisal (2007). | The existing development fails to provide sufficient cycle parking provision, which would result in poor quality living conditions for future residents, contrary to policies D4, D6, SI8 and T5 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The submitted information does not accurately reflect the works have been carried out on the site found at the site visit. As such, the proposed development, by reason of misleading and inaccurate submitted information is considered unacceptable. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021),  policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
