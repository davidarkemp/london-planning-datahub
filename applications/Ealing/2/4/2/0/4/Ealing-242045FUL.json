    "The proposed changes to the front elevation, upward extensions and first floor rear extension, by reason of its disproportionate size, and size, depth, bulk, mass respectively, would constitute an incongruous addition to the host property, that would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2023), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan. | The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its size, depth, bulk and mass, would constitute an unneighbourly form of development, that would have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties 231 and 235 High Street in terms of overbearing, outlook, sense of enclosure and loss of light. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2023), Policies 7.4, 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan. | The proposed residential units, by reason of inadequate internal floor areas of Flat A and inadequate living conditions to Flat B would constitute a substandard form of residential accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan, Policy LV3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan and the Mayor's Housing Design Standards LPG (2023). | The proposed bicycle store, by reason of its size and the blocking up of the front façade, would not be a sufficient size to accommodate 5 bicycles and would result in the loss of an active frontage harming the vitality of the high street. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan. | The non-provision of refuse storage, by reason of its lack of covered and secured waste and refuse storage for proposed flats would be unacceptable for future occupiers. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policy SI 7of the London Plan."
