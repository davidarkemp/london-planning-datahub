It is therefore unlawful. | Under  subsections 191 (2) and (3) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, a certificate cannot be granted where a use contravenes any enforcement notice or breach of condition notice in force at the time. As such, it is therefore not lawful and full planning permission is required."
