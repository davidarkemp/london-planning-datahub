    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, bulk, and massing of the single storey side/rear (wrap around) extension and part first floor side/rear extension, along with the loss of the oriel bay window, would result in an incongruous development that over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the property's original scale and character, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property and the local area. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19) and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance. | The proposed development, by reason of the loss of street tree (T1) without appropriate justification, would harm the visual amenity of the street, urban greening and local ecology. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies G5 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 5.10 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
