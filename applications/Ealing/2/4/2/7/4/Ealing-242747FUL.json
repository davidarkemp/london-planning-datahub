    "The proposed development, by reason of Flat 1 not meeting the minimum space standards, the bedroom areas for Flat 1 and Flat 2 also falling short of the required space standards, along with the absence of private amenity space for Flat 1, would result in substandard accommodation negatively affecting the living conditions of future occupants.  As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the Housing Design Standards LPG (2023). | The proposed two storey side/rear extension, by way of its design, would create an incongruent addition to the host dwelling.  The proposal would accordingly result in harm to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the surrounding area and the street scene. The application therefore fails to comply with Policies D4 and D5 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and NPPF (2023)."
