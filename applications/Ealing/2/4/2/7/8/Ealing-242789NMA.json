    "Given the nature of the proposed amendment and considering the original planning conditions, the proposal would meet the Council's criteria for non-material amendments due to the following reasons:",
    "- \tThere would be no material impact on any neighbours or other statutory and non-statutory bodies, and the resulting scheme would not be materially different in its external appearance and would remain within the fee paid and in accordance with the adopted policies of the Council.",
    "- \tThe changes would not compromise the overall design and appearance of the development.",
    "-  \tThe resulting scheme would not conflict with any existing planning conditions or legal agreement.",
    "Therefore, the proposal represents a 'non-material' change from the original planning application with regards to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and will not require assessment through the submission of a full planning application."
