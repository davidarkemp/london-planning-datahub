    "The proposed single storey front extension, by reason of its, bulk, scale design and forward projection beyond the predominant front elevation of the host dwelling, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area, visual amenity of the street scene and the uniformity and balance of the semi-detached dwelling pair. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Council's Housing Design Guidance."
