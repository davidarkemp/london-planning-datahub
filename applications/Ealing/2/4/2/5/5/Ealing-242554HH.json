    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive bulk, massing, and scale, would result in an overdevelopment of the site. Furthermore, proposal would have detrimental impacts on the level of amenity available to the occupants of 53 Brassie Avenue in terms of sense of enclosure. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
