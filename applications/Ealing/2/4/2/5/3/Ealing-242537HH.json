    "The proposed roof extensions, be reason of its design, siting and scale, would result a dominant, overbearing and visually harmful addition to the property, to the detriment of the character, appearance and design of the conservation area. The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policy HC1 of the London Plan, policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and the Generic Conservation Area Management Plan (2023) | The proposed roof extension, by reason of its siting and proximity to the boundary, would result in in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development and adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19), and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
