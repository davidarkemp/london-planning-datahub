    "The proposed single storey extension, by reason of its excessive bulk, massing, and scale, would result in an unreasonable degree of impact in terms of dominance and, visual impact to the Grade II Listed Building and Bedford Park Conservation Area. Furthermore, it would result in an unsympathetic development which is out of keeping with its setting and be harmful to the amenities of the occupants of neighbouring residents. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
