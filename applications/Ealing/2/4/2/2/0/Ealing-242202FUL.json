The development fails to respond positively into the existing industrial and canalside environment harmoniously. The building is out of character when viewed from the Canal's towpath and surrounding streets, to the detriment of the Canalside Conservation Area's character or appearance and results in less than substantial harm, with a lack of demonstrable public benefits to outweigh this harm.",

    "| The development, because of a combination of its proximity to the railway, height and visibility, and design, provides opportunity for trespass onto the railway, resulting in potential impacts to public safety, with insufficient measures to deter and design out criminal activity.",

    "| The application for retrospective planning permission inaccurately demonstrates the existing situation on the site with the buildings proximity to the Grand Union Canal inaccurately represented.",
