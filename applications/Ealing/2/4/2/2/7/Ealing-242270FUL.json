    "The as-installed extract flues and other plant equipment, by reason of their size, number, and untidy assembly, have created excessive visual clutter, detracting from the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The as-installed flues and plant equipment, due to their size, number, and proximity to residential flats, have been emitting unacceptable levels of noise, vibration, and odour, to the detriment of neighbouring amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D14 and SI 1 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The as-installed roof guttering has caused rainwater to run directly onto the nearby hard surfacing, adversely impacting sustainable drainage in the area. Consequently, the proposal conflicts with Policy SI 13 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 5.12 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
