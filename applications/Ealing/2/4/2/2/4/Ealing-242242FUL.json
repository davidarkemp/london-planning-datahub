    "The proposed two-storey side extension, by reason of its width and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the dwelling's symmetry with Number 3 Lily Gardens and would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site, constituting an incongruous and dominant addition readily visible from the street scene. The proposal would fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19) (2024). | Flat 3, proposed on the development's first floor, due to its undersized Gross Internal Area (GIA) and its lack of private amenity space, would result in a poor standard of accommodation for future occupiers. The proposal would not comply with the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7D and 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the London Plan Housing SPG (2016). | The proposal, which involves the sub-division of a 3-bed dwellinghouse, would result in the loss of a family-sized dwelling with direct access to a garden, for which there is a continued demand with the Borough. As a result, the proposal would not comply with Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) as it would not support the local need for additional family housing stipulated in the Ealing Local Housing Needs Assessment Update (2022). | The proposal would fail to provide a sufficient amount of cycle parking (5 spaces) and would also fail to house the cycle parking securely in a cycle store, shelter, or similar. As a result, the proposal would not comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), including Table 10.2."
