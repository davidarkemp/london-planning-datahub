    "The proposed basement extension, by reason of its excessive size, scale and siting, would be an incongruous and discordant form of development, result in an overdevelopment of the site and be against the prevailing pattern of development. The excessive nature of the proposed development would likely inhibit the ability for sustainable urban drainage to be facilitated. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policies D3, D4 and D10 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
