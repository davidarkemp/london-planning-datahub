    "Considering the age, size, and species of the tree, no heave report has been provided regarding the potential impacts of removal. The removal of the tree could potentially cause a catastrophic effect on surrounding properties. | The level monitoring report needs to be more conclusive. There are noticeable gaps in the level monitoring report most noticeably large gaps between March 2022 and December 2023, before becoming consistent again. | The level monitoring is showing 'slight' movement for the property, cracks 'slight' . BRE Digest 251 states these are 'aesthetic issues' that require only redecoration. The only area affected under 'moderate' is the bay window area, most likely due to shallow foundations in comparison to the rest of the property."
