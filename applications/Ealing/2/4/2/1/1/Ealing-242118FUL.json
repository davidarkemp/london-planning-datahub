    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive size and insubordinate scale, would represent an incongruous form of overdevelopment on this site, being out of keeping with the character of the CA and the host building. The proposed contemporary design would also be out of keeping with the design and appearance of the host building. It would create less than substantial harms to the CA and local heritage asset, in contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, the policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Ealing Cricket Ground Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and Ealing Generic Conservation Area Management Plan (2023). | 2\tThe proposed development, by reason of its office use, would lead to an inappropriate use and intensification of the site, being out of keeping with the residential nature of the area, in contrary to the policy D3 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development, by reason of the loss of mature trees within the Conservation Area protected by the provisions in section 211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the absence of replacement planting or compensation, would harm the landscape setting and visual amenity of the CA, in contrary to Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 5.10 of Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of the reduction in size of outdoor amenity space of the existing accommodation, would compromise the quality of supported and specialised accommodation by reducing the amenity space, in contrary to Policies S2 and H12 of the London Plan (2021)."
