    "The proposed alterations to the outrigger, by reason of the resultant width, inconsistent eave height and overall building appearance, would harm the main building's architectural integrity as well as the character and pattern of development of the Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and paragraph 208 of the NPPF 2023. | The proposed development, by reason of its height, scale, proximity to boundaries and elevated position, would cumulatively result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development to the residential amenities of the neighbouring property at no.8 Longfield Road. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
