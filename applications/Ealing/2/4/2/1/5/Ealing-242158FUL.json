    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, proportions, cantilevered form and blocky appearance, would represent a cramped and incongruous form of development that is out of keeping with the general pattern of development in the area. The proposal would fail to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Ealing Design Guidance (2022), and Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19). | The proposed development, by reason of its proximity to the existing residential use at 14 Park Parade, would significantly impact the occupants of this property, resulting in a significant loss of privacy as well as noise and disturbance. The proposal would not comply with the NPPF (2023), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19) (2024). | The proposed development, because of its gross internal area significantly below the minimum space requirements for a 1b2p 2-storey unit, inadequate floor-to-ceiling heights, and lack of genuinely private outdoor amenity space, would provide a poor standard of accommodation for future occupants. The proposed dwellinghouse would not comply with the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7D and 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, due to the location of the cycle parking outside of the application site boundary behind a recently constructed brick wall, would not give certainty that the proposed cycle stores could be relied upon for future occupiers. As such, the development would not comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021)."
