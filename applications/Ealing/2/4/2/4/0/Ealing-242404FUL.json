    "The proposed two-storey end of terrace dwelling, by reason of its scale, bulk, location, proximity to the boundary, and relationship to the existing building and the established appearance of the row of terraces, would be excessively bulky and visually prominent on this corner site and would be harmful to the street scene and the character of the area.  The development would therefore fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), and policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of the insufficient Gross Internal Area would fail to provide an acceptable level and quality of accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The proposal would result in parking provisions that exceed the maximum car parking standards adopted by the Local Planning Authority for dwelling type, contrary to policies T3, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012), as well as the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
