    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its height and bulk would constitute an overbearing, unsympathetic and un-neighbourly form of development that would result in an increased sense of enclosure  to nos. 160 and 164 Gunnersbury Lane, to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
