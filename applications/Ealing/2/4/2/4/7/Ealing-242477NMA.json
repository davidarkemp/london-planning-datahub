    "- \tThe changes would not compromise the overall design and appearance of the development.",
    "-  \tThe resulting scheme would not conflict with any existing planning conditions or legal agreement.",
    "Therefore, the proposal represents a 'non-material' change from the original planning application with regards to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and will not require assessment through the submission of a full planning application.",
