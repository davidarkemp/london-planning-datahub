    "The proposed single storey front/side porch extension and single storey rear extension, be reason of their inappropriate alien design, excessive size and scale, would cumulatively lead to incongruous additions which over-dominate of the property negatively impacting on the spatial arrangement, deviating from the original design and character of the listed building, to the detriment of the character, appearance and design of the conservation area and the listed building. The proposal therefore would create less than substantial harm to the host building and fail to comply with the objectives of the Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraph 208 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022), Bedford Park Conservation Area Character Management Plan (2007) and Ealing's Generic Management Plan for Conservation Areas (2023)."
