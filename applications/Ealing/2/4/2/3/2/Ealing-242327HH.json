    "By way of its design, width and siting, the proposed part single/part two storey side extension would extend too close to the boundary line and two-storey dwelling at 7A Westminster Road. The addition of excessive side mass and bulk will create a terracing effect, out of character with the rest of the area. The application therefore fails to comply with Policies D4 and D5 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and Stage B: Design Guidance of the Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
