The internal layout for flat 2 is considered illogical and would not provide an acceptable standard of accommodation. The proposed location for the refuse/bicycle store is considered to be a dysfunctional arrangement which would not provide ease of access to the residents.",
    "As such, the proposed residential accommodation would provide for unsatisfactory living conditions for future residents, the proposed details are not in accordance with the objectives of Policy D6 of the London Plan, Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Mayor's Housing SPG and the Technical Housing Standards."
