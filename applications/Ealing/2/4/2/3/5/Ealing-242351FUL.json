    "The proposed development for the construction of a front elevation dormer and side/ rear outrigger dormer, as a result of their overall scale, bulk, design and proximity to the street would fail to complement the pattern of development and would constitute an incongruous addition to the street scene that would be harmful to the character of the area and visual amenity of Newton Avenue. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D4 and D5 of the London Plan (2021)."
