    "No evidence has been provided to implicate individual trees in the alleged tree root damage.  Low-rise structures, such as garden walls, driveways and footpaths are usually constructed on shallow foundations that over time will distort and develop cracks and deformations.  This will happen even in locations where trees are not present.  Therefore it is important that evidence is presented showing that it is in fact tree roots causing the damage.",
    "These structures can also be repaired using construction methods that will avoid future damage from tree roots, negating the need to permanently impair the amenity and structural safety of the tree."
