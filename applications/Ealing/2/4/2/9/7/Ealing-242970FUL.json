Reason: In the interests of the adequate disposal, storage and collection of waste and recycling, to protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of highway and pedestrian safety all in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) and 6.1 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy SI7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) | The cycle storage areas shown on the approved plans shall provide at least 20 long stay cycle parking spaces in accordance with policy and these shall be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained permanently thereafter. Reason: In the interests of the adequate bicycle storage provision and in the interests of reducing congestion to the local transport network, in accordance with policies 1.1 (j) and 3.1(i) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be based on environmental noise levels occurring during most of the year, ie. measured during school and work weekdays. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room and external amenity noise levels shall not exceed the criteria set by BS8233:2014.

The measures shall ensure that the emitted external rating noise level will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity.",

The report will contain details for the installation of a filtered fresh air ventilation system capable of mitigating elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in the external air for all residential dwellings. The report shall also include the following information: a) Details and locations of the ventilation intake locations of all floors b) Details and locations of ventilation extracts locations of all floors The maintenance and cleaning of the systems shall be undertaken regularly in accordance with manufacturer specifications and shall be the responsibility of the primary owner of the property. Approved details shall be fully implemented prior to the occupation/use of the development and thereafter permanently retained and maintained.",

A scheme for air pollution mitigation measures based on the findings of the report shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of any works on the site. The plan shall include:",
    "a) Dust Management Plan for Demolition Phase",
    "b) Dust Management Plan for Construction Phase",
    "The applicant shall contact the council's pollution technical team about the installation of air quality monitors on site and always provide direct access to monitoring data for the duration of the project. The monitors shall be installed on site at least 4 weeks prior to any site clearance and demolition to provide baseline data and shall be maintained on site until first occupation of the development hereby approved. Direct access to monitoring data will be always provided. The Air Quality Dust Management Plan shall be implemented on commencement of any works on site and the site shall be managed in accordance with the approved plan for the duration of the construction. Reason: In the interests of the amenity of adjoining occupiers and to minimise particulate matter associated with construction works in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) (f) (j) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012, policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and policy SI1 of the London Plan(2021); and National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",

Unless it complies with the standards set out in the SPG, no NRMM shall be on site, at any time, whether in use or not, without the prior written consent of the local planning authority. The developer shall keep an up to date list of all NRMM used during the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development on the online register at https://nrmm.london/.",
