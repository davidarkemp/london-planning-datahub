    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Notwithstanding the provisions of Classes A - F of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (or any subsequent amendment to that order) no extensions, new windows or other alterations shall be carried out at the dwellinghouse hereby approved without the prior permission of the local planning authority obtained through the submission of a planning application.",

    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate bicycle storage provision and in the interests of reducing congestion to the local transport network, in accordance with policies 1.1 (j) and 3.1(i) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The private amenity area shown on the approved plans shall be laid out prior to first occupation of the dwelling hereby permitted and retained in perpetuity thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that there is adequate provision of amenity space within the site in accordance with London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57/60 dB) (See Appendix 5 SPG10). Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted for approval by the Council in writing, for the sound insulation of the building envelope, based on the aircraft noise contour spectrum specified in Section 6 Supplementary Planning Guidance 10, and which will achieve the internal criteria for noise sensitive rooms. The details should also include the provision of alternative means of acoustically attenuated ventilation and cooling, as necessary, (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise), in accordance with the Council's criteria. The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",

    "Reason: To protect the residential amenity of residents of the dwellings and ensure adequate provision of private amenity space in accordance with policies 1.1 and 2.1 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | No operations shall commence on site until appropriate measures for protection of nearby existing trees have been implemented.",
    "Reason: To ensure appropriate tree protection in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies G4, G5 and G7 of the London Plan, policy 5.10 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and the Ealing SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines. | Prior to occupation of the dwelling hereby approved the hard/soft landscape works and boundary treatments shown on the approved plans shall be implemented including planting of three new trees. Any trees or other plants which die or are removed within the first five years following the implementation of the landscaping scheme shall be replaced during the next planting season.",
