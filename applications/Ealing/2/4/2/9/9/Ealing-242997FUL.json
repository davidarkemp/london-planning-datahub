    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title numbers: Location Plan 10 PL, 11PL, 12PL, 13PL, 14PL Rev B, 15PL Rev B, 16PL, 17PL Rev B, Design and Access Statement by Planning Architecture Ltd (submitted July 2024), Arboricultural Impact Assessment Method Statement & Tree Protection Plan by Trevor Heaps Arboricultural Consultancy Ltd (March 2024).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | Notwithstanding the provisions of Classes A - F of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (or any subsequent amendment to that order) no extensions, new windows or other alterations shall be carried out at the dwellinghouses hereby approved without the prior permission of the local planning authority obtained through the submission of a planning application.",
    "Reason: To prevent the overdevelopment of the site, to safeguard the living conditions of adjoining properties and visual appearance of the area, and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D1, D4 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The materials and finishes to be used for all external surfaces (including hardstanding and boundary treatments) of the development hereby approved shall be as specified in the Design and Access Statement by Planning Architecture (submitted July 2024). The development shall be implemented only in accordance with these approved details.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B; London Plan (2021) policy D3 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The refuse storage area shown on the approved plans shall be provided prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained unobstructed in perpetuity.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate disposal, storage and collection of waste and recycling, to protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of highway and pedestrian safety all in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) and 6.1 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy SI7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The cycle storage areas shown on the approved plans shall provide at least 2 long stay cycle parking spaces in accordance with policy and these shall be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate bicycle storage provision and in the interests of reducing congestion to the local transport network, in accordance with policies 1.1 (j) and 3.1(i) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The private amenity area shown on the approved plans shall be laid out prior to first occupation of the dwelling hereby permitted and retained in perpetuity thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that there is adequate provision of amenity space within the site in accordance with London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing configurations shall be based on environmental noise levels occurring during most of the year, i.e. measured during school and work weekdays. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). The sound insulation installed shall ensure that internal and external amenity noise levels shall not exceed the criteria set by BS8233:2014. The required sound insulation shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'. | Control measures shall ensure that the following standards are implemented :",
    "- noise and vibration (according to Approved CoP BS 5228-1 and -2:2009+A1:2014),",
    "- dust (according to Supplementary Planning Guidance by the GLA (2014) for The Control of Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition),",
    "- lighting ('Guidance Note 01/20 For The Reduction Of Obtrusive Light' by the Institution of Lighting Professionals),",
    "- hours of work and all associated activities audible beyond the site boundary restricted to 0800-1800hrs Mondays to Fridays, 0800 -1300 Saturdays (no work on public holidays),",
    "- notifications of works to interested parties and regular neighbour liaison,  - public display of contact details including accessible phone numbers for persons responsible for the site works for the duration of the works in case of emergencies or complaints.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise, vibration, dust, lighting or other emissions from the site, in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'.",
    "| Prior to occupation of the dwelling hereby approved a timber fence 1.8m high shall be provided between the private amenity area of the approved dwelling and the amenity area of No. 67 St Dunstans Road and this fencing shall be permanently retained.",

All tree planting must be carried out in full accordance with the approved scheme in the nearest planting season (1st October to 28th February inclusive). The quality of all approved tree planting should be carried out to the levels detailed in British Standard 8545, Trees: from nursery to independence in the landscape - Recommendations.  Any trees which die, are removed, uprooted, significantly damaged, become diseased or malformed within five years from the completion of planting, must be replaced during the nearest planting season (1st October to 31st March inclusive) with a tree/s of the same size, species and quality as previously approved.",
    "Reason: To mitigate loss of trees on the site and in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies G4, G5 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), policy 5.10 of Ealing's Development Management DPD and Ealing's SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines.",
