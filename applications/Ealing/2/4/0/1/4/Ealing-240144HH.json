    "The proposed development, by reason of its loss of side link to the adjoining property, its height, bulk, depth, design and scale would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would fail to appear subordinate to the original house and would result in being out of keeping with the character and appearance of host dwelling and the area and would demonstrable harm to the street scene . As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
