    "The proposed development would introduce new items that would materially vary the description of proposal of the original planning permission. As such, the proposal goes beyond the scope of Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and is contrary to Planning Practice Guidance Paragraph: 014 Reference ID: 17a-014-20140306. | The proposed alterations to the front garden and front porch, by virtue of their unsympathetic design and excessive area, would cumulatively harm the host building's architectural integrity and the character of the Brunswick Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, policies 7.4 and 7C of the Ealign Development Management DPD 2013, the Brunswick Conservation Area Management Plan 2007 and Ealing Generic Management Plan for Conservation Areas 2023."
