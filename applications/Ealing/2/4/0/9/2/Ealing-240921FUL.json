    "The proposed flat 3 and 4 would fail to provide the required minimum GIA set out by Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021). The proposal also proposes inadequate layout to make provision for cycle parking and outdoor amenity spaces that would result in substandard amenity and living conditions for future occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies H9, D1, D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The loss of a family sized unit and lack of appropriate housing mix in the proposal would fail to meet Ealing Council's strategic requirement for larger homes within the borough, contrary to Ealing Local Housing Needs Assessment Update 2022 and policies H9 and H10 of the London Plan (2021).\t | The submitted location plan and site plan have provided inaccurate orientation. Hence, it is considered that the proposed development would be inconsistent with the objectives of Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
