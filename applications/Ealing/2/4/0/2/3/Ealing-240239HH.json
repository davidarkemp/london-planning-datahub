    "The proposed development, including the rear and outbuilding extensions, would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site due to their height, bulk, depth, and scale. The structures would be overly dominant and would fail to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 Residential Extensions, Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022) and Policy DAA of Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19) (2022). | The proposed single-storey rear extension, because of its depth and height, would significantly lessen the standard of amenity for the ground- floor flat at Number 10 Balfour Road. The structure would appear dominant and overbearing when viewed from this property, resulting in a loss of light, overshadowing and a sense of enclosure. The development would fail to comply with Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19) (2022)."
