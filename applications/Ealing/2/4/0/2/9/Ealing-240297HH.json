    "The proposed roof extension, by reason of its scale, mass, bulk, design and siting, would result in a development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19), SPD4 Residential Extensions and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance. | The proposed roof extension, by reason of its scale, mass, bulk, design and siting, would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, that would create an increased sense of enclosure and harm the visual amenities of No. 81 Ferndale Crescent. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19)."
