    "The proposed conversion of the dwellinghouse into two units, by reason of its removal of a functional and well-designed two-bedroom home from the housing supply and creation of undersized units, would constitute an inefficient use of existing housing stock and overcrowding of the property. As such, the proposal would not satisfy The London Plan (2021) Policies GG5 and H9 and Development Management: Development Plan Document (2013) Local Plan Policy 3.4. | The proposed conversion of the dwellinghouse into two units, by reason of its overly small, combined living, kitchen, and dining areas, lack of overall sufficient internal living space and absence of a private outdoor living area for the first storey unit, would constitute a substandard form of residential accommodation, to the detriment of the quality and design of the property and living conditions of the residents. As such, the proposal would not satisfy The London Plan (2021) Policy D6 and Development Management: Development Plan Document (2013) Local Plan Policy 3.5."
