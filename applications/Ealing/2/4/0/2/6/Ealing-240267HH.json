    "The proposed single storey rear outbuilding, by reason of its height, bulk, design, excessive footprint that is not proportionate to its intended use and scale would fail to harmonise with the application site and would constitute an incongruous and inappropriate development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the application site and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and SPD4."
