    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its bulk, mass, width and flat roof design, would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19), SPD4 Residential Extensions and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance."
