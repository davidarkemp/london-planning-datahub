    "The proposed roof extensions by reason of scale, width, height, bulk, prominence and visual impact would be an obtrusive and illogical form of development that would fail to appear subordinate to the original house and would cause unacceptable disruption to the original roofscape, result in harm to the character and appearance of the local area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022."
