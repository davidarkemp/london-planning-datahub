    "The two storey rear extension by reason of its cumulative impact of the full width two storey rear extension, and the variation of roof forms between the host dwelling, proposed two storey rear extension and the single storey rear extension would constitute in a bulky, incongruous and over dominant development harming the character and appearance of the locality and the host building. The development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022), Draft Ealing Local Plan (2024) (Reg 22) and the Ealing Housing Design Guidance."
