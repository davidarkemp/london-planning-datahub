    "The proposed changes to the front elevation, including the unnecessarily wide side extension with an expansive flat roof, the removal of the ground floor bay window and the installation of new windows and doors different to the existing in arbitrary positions, would result in a mismatch of prominent features, which would be out of keeping with and detrimental to the character of the host building and surrounding area. The proposal would fail to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the Ealing Design Guidance (2022) and SPD4. | The proposed development would result in substandard accommodation by reason of Flat 3 failing to meet the Gross Internal Area requirements for a 2b 3p unit and Flat 2 resulting in a long, narrow unit which would not benefit from good ventilation, outlook or light levels. The proposal would fail to accord with the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the Housing Design Standards LPG (2023). | The proposed development would result in the loss of a family-sized dwelling and would fail to provide a mix of dwelling types and sizes to meet the housing needs of the Borough and to encourage a mixed and balanced community. As such, the proposal would not provide an acceptable housing mix and would fail to comply with Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and the Ealing Local Housing Needs Assessment Update (2022)."
