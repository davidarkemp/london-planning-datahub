    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and cumulative impact would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the building's original scale and character, and which results in the overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and local area. The development would therefore fail to comply with D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The submitted planning application and drawings have provided misrepresentations between proposed plans. Hence, the Council is unable to fully assess the proposed development and in the absence of accurate and consistent details it is considered that the proposed development would be inconsistent with the objectives of Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
