    "The proposed first floor extension, by reasons of the siting, size, scale and design would create an incongruous and discordant feature to the host building and be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area, in contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, with its rear external staircase and additional entrance on 1/F, by reason of its proximity to the boundary, would give rise to unacceptable impact on privacy of No. 38 Bilton Road, in contrary to the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed residential units, by reasons of its inadequate internal size and private amenity space, would result in poor quality of accommodation for the future occupants, failing to comply with the objectives of the policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Housing Design Standards LPG (2023)."
