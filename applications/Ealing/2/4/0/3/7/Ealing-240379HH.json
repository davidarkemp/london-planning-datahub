    "The proposed additional access by reason of its nature of being the third access of the application site and its location being within 10m of a road junction, would most likely result in detrimental impacts on pedestrian and highway safety. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies T3 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The proposed additional access by reason of its design and prominent location, would most likely result in detrimental impacts on the character and appearance of the host building and the conservation area. As such, the proposal is contrary to the objectives of the Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, policies D3, D4 & HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B & 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and Generic Management Plan for Conservation Areas (2023)."
