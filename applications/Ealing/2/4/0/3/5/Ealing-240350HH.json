    "By reason of their depth, width and height, the proposed front roof dormer extensions would interrupt the prevailing roof slope and character of the host dwelling. The overall scale and design of the proposed dormers windows, including the excessive use of glazing and the disproportionality of the width of the bezels/facing walls are of an incongruous and discordant size in relation to the host building and would occupy a excessive amount of roof space, failing to demonstrate a subservient and delicate presence, eroding the character of the South and West elevations of the parent property, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area",
    "As such, the proposed front roof extensions would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan (Reg19)."
