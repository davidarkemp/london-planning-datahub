    "The proposed single storey side and rear wraparound extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height, scale, siting and bulk, would result in an incongruous addition to the original dwellinghouse and would be unacceptable in terms of character and design. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed single storey side and rear wraparound extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height, scale, siting and bulk, would result in an unreasonable degree of impact in terms loss of light, overbearing, visual impact and sense of enclosure towards the residential amenities of 22 and 18 Highfield Road. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
