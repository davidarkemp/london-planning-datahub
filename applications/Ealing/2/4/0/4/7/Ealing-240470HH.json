    "The proposed rear dormer extension, by way of its mass, bulk, scale and size will serve as an uncharacteristic and incongruous addition to the parent property, failing to adhere to the character and heritage of the surrounding Conservation Area of St Mark's Church and Canal and eroding the character of the application site. The harm of the proposal fails to outweigh the public benefit, making it an illogical development to the application site within the Conservation Area.",
    "As such, the proposed rear roof extension fails to comply with the objectives set out in policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Generic Conservation Area Management Plan (2023) and the NPPF."
