    "The proposed partial demolition of the boundary wall will induce adverse impact to the heritage assets and the architectural language of the surrounding context. It would create 'less than substantial harm' to the character and appearance of the Application site and the conservation area whilst there is no public benefit offered to mitigate or compensate such harm. As such, the proposal does not comply with the objectives of the Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, the Ealing Green Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and Generic Management Plan for Conservation Areas (2023). | The proposed additional parking spaces would exceed the maximum residential parking standards and provisions prescribed under Policy T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 6.13 of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2012)."
