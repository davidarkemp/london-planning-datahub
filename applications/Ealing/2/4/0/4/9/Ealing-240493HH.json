    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its height, bulk and siting, would constitute an overbearing, unsympathetic and un-neighbourly form of development that would result in an increased sense of enclosure and a harmful loss of sunlight/daylight to 9 Lily Gardens, to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
