    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive depth and its close proximity to site boundaries, would cause unacceptable harm to residential amenity of no. 103  St Albans Avenue, resulting in a loss of light, outlook, and cause a sense of enclosure and overbearing towards the occupiers of this property. As such, it is considered the proposed rear extension would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF 2023), Policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 (g) and (h) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy, policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and the advice contained in the Ealing Housing Design Guide (2022). | The proposed first floor extension, by reason of its design, bulk, width and depth, would be an overbearing and dominant form of development that would fail to achieve subordination with the host dwelling, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF 2023), Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 (g) and (h) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy, policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and the advice contained in the Ealing Housing Design Guide (2022)."
