    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing / document title number(s):  Site Location Plan, Proposed Front and Side Elevations, Floor Plans 550-A01 Rev B, Proposed Rear and Side Elevations, Proposed Block Plan 550-A04, Section A and Roof Plan 550-A02 Rev B, Existing Block Plan 550-A03, Design & Access Statement, Attic Plan 10223-A, Basement Plan 10223-A, Elevations Sheet 1 10223-E1, Elevations Sheet 2 10223-E2, Ground Floor Plan 10223-G, First Floor Plan 10223-F, Second Floor Plan 10223-S, Roof Plan 10223-R, Herrington Consulting Daylight/Sunlight Report",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Cycle storage for ^IN;  bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the development, within secure, lockable compounds in accordance with the designated locations identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and all adopted standards prior to the first occupation of the building. The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:  To provide adequate bicycle storage in accordance with policy and T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the designated location identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be based on environmental noise levels occurring during most of the year, ie. measured during school and work weekdays, and in accordance with internal noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall not exceed noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policies D3, D4 and D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, namely, bedrooms below/above kitchen/living/dining/bathrooms and circulation space of separate flats. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Standard 30 London Housing SPG 2016 and Policy D14 London Plan.",
    "| Prior to commencement of the development, a demolition method statement/ construction management plan shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing. Details shall include control measures for:-",
    "- noise and vibration (according to Approved CoP BS 5228-1 and -2:2009+A1:2014),",
    "- dust (according to Supplementary Planning Guidance by the GLA (2014) for The Control of Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition),",
    "- lighting ('Guidance Note 01/20 For The Reduction Of Obtrusive Light' by the Institution of Lighting Professionals),",
    "- delivery locations,",
    "- hours of work and all associated activities audible beyond the site boundary restricted to 0800-1800hrs Mondays to Fridays and 0800 -1300 Saturdays (except no work on public holidays),",
    "- neighbour liaison, notifications to interested parties and considerate complaints procedure,",
    "- public display of contact details including accessible phone numbers for persons responsible for the site works for the duration of the works, in case of emergencies, enquiries or complaints.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise, vibration, dust, lighting or other emissions from the site, in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and policies D3, D4 and D14 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Prior to the commencement of development, a flood risk assessment, sustainable drainage strategy and a ground investigation report shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "The sustainable drainage strategy shall include a drainage proforma form, a detailed drainage design (incl. drawings and supporting calculations) and a maintenance plan (incl. maintenance tasks for all drainage components). The strategy shall achieve compliance with greenfield run-off rates and shall demonstrate a reduction of flood risk (betterment of existing drainage) at the site through sustainable drainage mitigation techniques.",
    "The ground investigation report shall determine infiltration rates, water table level, etc. and all other appropriate investigation to confirm the development would not adversely affect ground water flow paths. Consideration shall be given to compensate loss of storage within the ground and appropriate mitigation measures shall be implemented.",
    "Approved details shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the development and permanently retained and maintained.",
    "Reason:  To reduce surface water run-off and the risk of the flooding of the application property, neighbouring properties, and local area in accordance with policy 5.12 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy), policies D10, SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021). | The solar PV equipment shall not protrude more than 0.2 metres beyond the plane of the roof slope when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the roof slope. The panels shall not project above the highest part of the roof.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the equipment would not become a dominant feature within the street scene or harm local character, in accordance with policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D4 and D5 of the London Plan (2021)."
