    "The proposed conversion of the dwellinghouse into three units, by reason of removing a family-sized home from the housing supply and creating undersized flats, would constitute an inefficient use of existing housing stock and overcrowding of the property. As such, the proposal would not satisfy The London Plan (2021) policies GG5 and H9. | The proposed conversion of the dwellinghouse into flats, by reason of Flats 2 and 3 on the first and second storeys having undersized total floor areas due to a reduced area or not meeting the minimum floor to ceiling heights for useable space, containing an undersized bedroom, not having access to private outdoor amenity space, not sufficiently demonstrating high-quality and accessible and inclusive design in terms of streetscape and site access, inducing reliance on private-vehicles for transportation, and containing inaccuracies in the existing and proposed architectural plans, would be to the detriment of the quality and design of the property and setting as well as the living conditions of the residents. As such, the proposal would not satisfy The London Plan (2021) Policies D1, D3, D4, D5, T5, and T6 and Development Management: Development Plan Document (2013) Local Plan Policies 3.4, 6.13, and 7.4."
