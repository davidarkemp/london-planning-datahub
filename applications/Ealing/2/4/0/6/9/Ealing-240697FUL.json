    "The proposed development, by reason of its plot coverage, top-heavy form, protruding balcony situated deep in the plot and large brick expanse on the South East flank, would represent a cramped and incongruous form of development out of keeping with the general pattern of development in the area. The proposal would fail to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Ealing Design Guidance (2022), SPD4, and Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19). | The proposed development, by reason of its front wall in close quarters (1.15m) from the rear bedroom window at first-floor level serving a bedroom of the HMO at 14 Park Parade, and by reason of its balcony deep in the plot, would result in significant losses of light, outlook, loss of privacy, overlooking and a sense of enclosure for neighbours. The proposal would fail to comply with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), SPD4 and Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19). | The proposal would result in a cramped form of development, providing inadequate private amenity space (3.61m² of useable space) and floor to ceiling heights (2.3 - 2.4m) to serve the proposed dwellinghouse. It would fail to comply with The Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (March 2015), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7D and 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the London Plan Guidance Housing Design Standards (2023)."
