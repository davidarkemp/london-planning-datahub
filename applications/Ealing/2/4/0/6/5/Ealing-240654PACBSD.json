Prior Approval is required and granted. | The development permitted shall be completed before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",

    "| The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be based on environmental noise levels occurring during most of the year, ie. measured during school and work weekdays, and in accordance with internal noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall not exceed noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
