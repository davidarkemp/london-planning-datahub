    "The proposed outbuilding, by way of its layout, openings and size, as well as its complete and physical separation from the main dwelling house, would create a substandard quality of accommodation for the proposed occupant who requires a specific level of care. The outbuilding would feature a limited amount of openings which would not provide the occupant with sufficient levels of natural light and ventilation, to the detriment of the living conditions of the occupant.",
    "As such, the proposal fails to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan, Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Mayor's Housing SPG and the Technical Housing Standards. | The proposed outbuilding, by way of its design and height, would serve as an incongruous addition to the application site.",
    "The proposed roof form, would fail to harmonise with the character of Seward Road and Oaklands Road. The height and length of the proposed outbuilding would make the application site appear cramped and would have an adverse impact to the overall appearance of the site. In addition, the height and bulk of the outbuilding along the rear boundary of no. 4 Seward Road, would constitute an unneighbourly form of development, that would result in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook, to the detriment of the living conditions of the occupants of this neighbouring property.",
    "As such, the proposal fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed outbuilding, by way of its large opening to the front elevation and limited setback from the street, would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation and not provide adequate privacy, to the detriment of the living conditions of the intended occupant.",
    "As such, the proposal fails to comply with policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
