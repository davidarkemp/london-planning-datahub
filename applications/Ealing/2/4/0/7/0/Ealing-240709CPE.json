    "The submitted evidence as required under Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), does not sufficiently demonstrate, on the balance of probability, that the dwelling has been in continuous use as three self- contained flats for a continuous period greater than 4 years prior to the application being submitted. It is therefore recommended that a Lawful Development Certificate not be granted, and that planning permission is required."
