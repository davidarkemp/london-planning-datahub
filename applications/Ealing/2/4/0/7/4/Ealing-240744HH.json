    "The proposed single storey extension, by reason of its excessive bulk, massing, scale, and bulk, would result in an unreasonable degree of impact in terms of dominance, visual impact to the Grade II Listed Building and Churchfields Conservation Area. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D3, D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed single storey extension, by reason of its Metropolitan Open Land designation, would be inappropriate development that would not be outweighed by any very special circumstances. The proposal would therefore be harmful to the MOL, to the detriment of its open character and visual amenity. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the policies 152, 153 and 154 of National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policies G3 of the London Plan (2021)."
