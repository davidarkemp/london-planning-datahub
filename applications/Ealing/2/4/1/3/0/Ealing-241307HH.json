    "The proposed development by reason of its scale, massing, height and depth would result in an incongruous and overbearing form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities of the neighbouring property at no. 22 Fosse Way and to the detriment of the character of the dwellinghouse and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19) (2024) and the Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
