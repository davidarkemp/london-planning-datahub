    "The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its design and siting within the rear garden of 107 Beechwood Avenue would represent a dominant and incongruous form of development that would result in the overdevelopment of this site and reduce the spaciousness of the Ferrymead Avenue streetscene, to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the wider area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 3.5, 7B, 7.4 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of the insufficient and unsuitable private amenity space, would fail to provide an acceptable level and quality of accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 3.5 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
