    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | The materials and finishes of the fencing and floodlighting masts shall be as specified in the approved plans.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B; London Plan (2021) policy D3 and National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | External artificial lighting at the development shall not exceed the vertical illumination lux levels at neighbouring premises that are recommended for Environmental Zone 3 by the Institution of Lighting Professionals in the 'Guidance Note 01/20 For The Reduction Of Obtrusive Light'.  Lighting should be minimized by limiting the hours of use. Glare and sky glow should be prevented by correctly using, locating, aiming and shielding luminaires, in accordance with the Guidance Note.",
