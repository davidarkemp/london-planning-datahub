    "The cumulative impact of both the existing and proposed extension by reason of its bulk, scale, height, design and materiality would have an adverse impact on the residential amenity of nos. 15 and 19 Windermere Road by way of loss of light, overshadowing and enclosure.",
    "As such, it is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its impacts on neighbouring amenity and would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | By way of its depth, width and setting, the proposed extension, in combination with the existing rear extension, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, that would fail to adhere to the prevailing pattern of development, to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenity of the host dwelling and the surrounding area.",
    "As such, it is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its scale and design and fails to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
