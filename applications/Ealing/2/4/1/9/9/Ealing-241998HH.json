    "The proposed front extension, by virtue of its scale, siting and design, would undermine the overall rhythm, pattern of development and spatial character in the area as well as constitute an overbearing additional to host building to the detriment of its architectural integrity. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013. | The proposed front extension would be in close proximity to a TPO tree. In the absence of an Arboricultural Method Statement, the proposal has failed to take adequate account of the TPO tree onsite as an important element in the character and appearance of the area, contrary to policies D4 and G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies 7B of the Ealing development management DPD 2013."
