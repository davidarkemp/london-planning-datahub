    "The proposed first floor side extension and hip to gable roof conversion, by reason of its proximity to the side boundary and unsympathetic roof design, would create terracing effect between the host building and the adjoining property and fail to respond to the existing roof profile of the area, to the detriment of the design, character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal is contrary policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19), and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
