The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:  To provide adequate bicycle storage in accordance with policy and T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the designated location identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, namely, bedrooms adjoining the communal main entrance and below the kitchen/living/dining room of separate flat. The assessment and mitigation measures shall have regard to standards of the Council's SPG10 and noise limits specified in BS8233:2014.
