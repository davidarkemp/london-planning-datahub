    "The roof extension by reason of its design, siting, scale and appearance would be out of keeping with the streetscene resulting in visual harm to the amenity of the area; and would detrimentally alter the original roof profile of the host property and that of attached property as a whole, resulting in the removal of the harmony of the roofscapes within the row, in addition to being disproportionate addition which would fail to be subordinate to the scale of the host dwelling and unsympathetic to the dwelling's original character. As such the proposal is inconsistent with the aims of the paragraph 135 B and C of the National Planning Policy Framework   (2023), and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Housing Design Guidance (2022 )."
