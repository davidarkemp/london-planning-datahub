    "Insufficient and inadequate evidence has been submitted to establish, on the balance of probability, that the single storey outbuilding at 114A Lady Margaret Road has been in continuous use as a self-contained residential flat for a period for 4 consecutive years prior to this application, without interruption. Inadequate information has also been provided to demonstrate that the use of the outbuilding would not be subject to a 10 year immunity period as required by s171B(3) of the Town and Country Planning Act. The described proposal is unlawful by virtue of Section 191(2)(a) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990."
