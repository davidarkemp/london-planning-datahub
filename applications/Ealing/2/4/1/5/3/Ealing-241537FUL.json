    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing numbers: 23-036-E01, 23-036-E02, 23-036-E03, 23-036-E04, 23-036-P01, 23-036-P02, 23-036-P03, 23-036-P04.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall be as specified in the approved drawings and the Design & Access Statement by R+W (April 2024).",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B; London Plan (2021) policy D3; and National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The outbuilding hereby approved shall be used only for domestic purposes incidental to the existing dwelling on this site, and shall not be used for separate habitable accommodation, letting or any commercial use. No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed at any time.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | No operations shall commence on site in connection with the development hereby approved until measures for protection of existing trees have been implemented as specified in the submitted Arboricultural Planning Report by AD Tree Consulting (April 2024). All tree protection methods detailed in the approved Arboricultural Planning Report shall not be moved or removed, temporarily or otherwise, until all works including external works have been completed and all equipment, machinery and surplus materials have been removed from the site, unless the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority has first been sought and obtained.",
    "Reason: To ensure appropriate tree protection in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies G4, G5 and G7 of the London Plan, policy 5.10 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and the Ealing SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines."
