    "The proposed advertisement by reason of its siting, continuous illumination, and digital design would be excessively prominent, dominant and visually detrimental to the character and appearance of the Ealing Town Centre Conservation Area, listed building and the Heritage Asset. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). |  The proposed advertisement by reason of its digital displays and 24/7 illumination would unduly impact the residential amenity of the immediately adjoining property, at no. 2 Chatsworth Gardens and the nearby residents of the applicant site. As such, the proposal fails to comply with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021)"
