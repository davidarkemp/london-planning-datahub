The development would therefore fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), policies D4 of the London Plan (2021), and policies 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed two-storey side to rear extension by reason of its unneighbourly height bulk and mass and its  close proximity to the rear elevations of the neighbouring properties at No. 11 and 15 St Georges Avenue, would result in harmful impacts in terms of overdominance, loss of light and overshadowing to the detriment of their residential amenities, contrary to the Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), Policy 5.10 Ealing Local Variation, and policies 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
