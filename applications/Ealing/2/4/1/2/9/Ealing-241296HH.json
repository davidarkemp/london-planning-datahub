    "The proposed side extension, because of its design, siting and scaling at ground floor level and being hard-up against the street, would represent an overly dominant and incongruous development, resulting in undue harm to the visual amenity and character of the surrounding area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19) (2024), and the Ealing Design Guidance (2022)."
