    "By reason of its overall design, scale, mass, and bulk, the proposed roof extensions and hip to gable alteration of the existing extension will serve as an incongruous, dominating and illogical development to the application site. The hip to gable alteration will result in an overly wide and bulky appearance within the street scene, and the proposed front and rear roof extensions, inclusive of the terrace created within the front roof slope will contribute a cluttered and unsympathetic appearance, serving as a detriment to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the host dwelling and the surrounding area.",
    "The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), NPPF (2023) and Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan (Reg19) (2024)."
