As such, the proposal would not satisfy The London Plan (2021) policies D1 and D4 and Development Management: Development Plan Document (2013) Local Plan Policy 7.4. | The proposed development, by reason of it occupying a building within the Strategic Industrial Location for non-industrial purposes, would not meet current and future demands for industrial and related functions in London and would not be appropriate to the existing and planned soundscapes.
