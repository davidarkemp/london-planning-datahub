  "description": "Application for a Minor Material Amendment (S73.a) to vary condition 2 (approved drawing/document) of planning permission ref: 203650FUL dated 22/06/2022 for: Construction of a two storey residential building with habitable roof space and basement level, to accommodate  9 self-contained residential units (1 x 1-bedroom, 5 x 2-bedroom & 3 x 3-bedroom) (following demolition of the existing building) and associated private and communal amenity space, refuse, cycle storage and relocated driveway crossover. Amendment seeks to reduce the footprint and massing at the rear to the first and loft floors, whilst retaining the architectural design and accommodation schedule; to incorporate the recently approved discharge of planning condition 4 (cycle parking) and planning condition 5 (refuse and recycling storage)",
