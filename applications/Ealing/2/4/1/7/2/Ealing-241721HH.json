    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| The outbuilding hereby approved shall be used as a gym/storage, or other domestic purposes ancillary to the dwelling on this site, and shall not be used for separate habitable accommodation, letting or any commercial use. No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed at any time.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | Existing trees adjacent/close to the boundaries of the site shall not be lopped, felled or otherwise affected in any way (including raising or lowering soil levels under the crown spread of the trees) and no excavation shall be cut under the crown spread of the trees. Protection of the trees, hedgerows and groups of mature shrubs off site that are adjacent/close to it shall be carried out only in accordance with British Standard 5837:2005 'Trees In Relation To Construction Recommendations' (or any subsequent revision), and shall be maintained fully intact and (in the case of the fencing) at all times, until the completion of all building operations on the site.",
    "Reason:  In order to safeguard trees and other vegetation considered to be worthy of retention in the interests of the visual amenity of the area as a whole, policies D4, D8 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 (e) (g), 1.2(f), 3.1(b) and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
