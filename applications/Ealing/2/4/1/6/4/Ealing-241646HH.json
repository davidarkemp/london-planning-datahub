    "The development, by reason of its front plot design and hardstanding occupancy, results in a marked and harmful change to the degree of openness in the immediate area, results in a dominant and intrusive form of development and is at odds with the architecture of the original dwelling to the detriment of the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The development fails to comply with the NPPF (2023), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), polices 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Management Plan."
