    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, depth, height, bulk and design, would result in a discordant and insubordinate nature of development, to detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal would fail to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19) and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance. | The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its depth, height, bulk, scale and design would adversely affect the visual amenities of numbers 60 Elm Tree Close and create undue increase sense of enclosure. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19)."
