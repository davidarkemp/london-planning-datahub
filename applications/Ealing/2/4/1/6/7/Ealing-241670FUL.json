    "The proposed development, by reason of removing and altering notable architectural features of the locally listed shopfront, would not conserve the significance of the heritage asset and conservation area and not respect the form, experience, quality, context, and character of the area. No clear and convincing justification and no public benefit is provided. As such, the proposal would not satisfy The London Plan (2021) policies HC1, D1,D3,  and D4 and Development Management: Development Plan Document (2013) policies 7C and 7.4, and the test in Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework. | The proposed development, by reason of Units 2 and 3 being 11 square metres under the minimum gross internal floor area requirements, all units not having private outdoor living spaces, and Unit 2's Bedroom 2 not providing adequate access to daylight, sunlight, and an attractive outlook, would not be fit for purpose nor meet the needs of its occupants and their well-being. As such, the proposal would not satisfy The London Plan (2021) policies D5 and D6 and Development Management: Development Plan Document (2013) policies 7B and 7D. | The proposed development, by reason of not providing onsite cycle parking, would present a barrier to cycling for the occupants of the units. As such, the proposal would not satisfy The London Plan (2021) policy T5."
