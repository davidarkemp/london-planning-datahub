    "The proposed change from timber to UPVC windows literally constitutes a 'material amendment' that would affect the building's overall appearance. In addition, the proposal is unclear due to inconsistent wording on the plans and drawing numbers on the application form. The proposed amendments therefore cannot be accepted as a non-material amendment to planning permission 240234FUL dated  07/03/2024 in accordance with Section 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for Non-Material Amendments Following a Grant of Planning Permission (2011)."
