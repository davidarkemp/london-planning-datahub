    "The proposed Class E(g) use would introduce a non-conforming use within a Strategic Industrial Location (SIL) to the detriment of the integrity and effectiveness of the SIL and the existing Sui Generis use. The proposal would fail to comply with Policies E4, E5 and E7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 4A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Policies 1.1 and 3.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed development, by reason of its façade design, would be at odds with the prevailing characteristic of the SIL where the vast majority of buildings are designed to be functional and support patterns of movement for people, servicing, logistics and creative industries. The design would harmfully impact how the area around the building would function. The proposal would fail to comply with the NPPF (2023), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19) (2024). | The proposed development has the potential to be a significant traffic generator. The existing road capacity would be unlikely to be able to accommodate the anticipated number of vehicle movements, which could also compromise the surrounding industrial uses. The proposal would not comply with Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021) or the the NPPF (2023)."
