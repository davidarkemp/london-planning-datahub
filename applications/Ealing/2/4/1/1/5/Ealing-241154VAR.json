The proposed amendment would therefore be contrary to policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). It is considered that the proposal does not fall within the provisions of s73 of the Town and Country Planning Act or the Council's Protocol for Minor Material Amendments."
