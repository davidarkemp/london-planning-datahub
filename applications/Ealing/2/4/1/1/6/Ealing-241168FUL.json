    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate bicycle storage provision and in the interests of reducing congestion to the local transport network, in accordance with policies 1.1 (j) and 3.1(i) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The amenity area shown on the approved plans shall be laid out prior to first occupation of the dwelling hereby permitted and retained in perpetuity thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that there is adequate provision of amenity space within the site in accordance with London Plan Policy D6 and Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | Prior to commencement of the development (excluding demolition and site clearance works), a noise assessment report shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of external noise sources including transport/ industrial/ commercial/ cultural uses and their noise levels occurring at the site during most of the year, i.e. measured during school and work weekdays, in accordance with internal noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve criteria of BS8233:2014.  The approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
