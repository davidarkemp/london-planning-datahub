    "The proposed duplex, by reason of its lack of an appropriately sized double bedroom, and lack of adequate internal floor area, would provide a substandard form of residential accommodation, to the detriment of the amenities of future occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), the London Plan guidance Housing Design Standards (2023) and the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). | The proposed roof extension, by reason of its scale, mass, bulk, design and siting, would result in a development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the building's original scale and character, to detriment of the character and appearance of the host residential property and local area. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2023(Update) - section 12, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's Local Plan (Reg.19) and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The proposed roof extension, by reason of its scale, mass, bulk, design and siting, would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, that would create an increased sense of enclosure, loss of light and outlook and harm the visual amenities of Nos. 62 Southfield Road, Flat 2, First floor, 64 Southfield Road and Flat 4, 64 Southfield Road (second floor)(application property). As such, the proposal is contrary to National Planning Policy Framework 2023(Update) - section 12, Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of Ealing's Local Plan (Reg. 19)."
