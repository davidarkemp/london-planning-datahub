    "The proposed de-conversion of 2 flats into a single family dwellinghouse is not considered to constitute the meaning of  'development' as set out by Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990); nor will the proposal be contrary to any local  planning policy that seeks the protection of small units within the borough. As such, the proposal is considered to meet the requirements for permitted development and as such does not require full planning permission."
