    "The proposed extension to the rear outrigger would result in a bulky, disproportionate addition which would fail to be subordinate to the scale of the host dwelling and unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19), SPD4 Residential Extensions and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance. | The proposed extensions would result in unacceptable impacts on the amenity of adjoining residential properties in terms of loss of daylight, an increased sense of enclosure and overbearing effects contrary to policy 7B of Ealing's Development Management DPD, and Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19) and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
