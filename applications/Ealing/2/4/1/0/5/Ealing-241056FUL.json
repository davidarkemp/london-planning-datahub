    "The proposed change of use from a café (Class E(b)) to a hot food takeaway (Sui Generis) would result in an unacceptable concentration of hot food takeaway uses in the area, detrimental to the retail character and vitality of Hanwell Town Centre and the special setting of the Hanwell Clock Tower Conservation Area. The proposal would fail to meet the statutory tests in the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as well as the NPPF (2023) and would fail to comply with Policies SD6, HD6, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 4C, 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies 1.1 and 2.7 of the Local Development Framework Adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DAA of the Ealing Local Plan (Reg 19) (2024). | The proposed change of use from a café (Class E(b)) to a hot food takeaway (Sui Generis) would increase the availability of unhealthy food within a high concentration of similar takeaway establishments. Moreover, the application site is within 400m of two primary schools and one secondary school, which would give rise to public health concerns. As such, the proposal fails to comply with Policies GG3 and E9 of the London Plan (2021), Policy 4C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy 1.1 of the Local Development Framework Adopted Core Strategy (2012)."
