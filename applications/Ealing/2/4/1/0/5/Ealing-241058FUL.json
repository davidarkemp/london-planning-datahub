    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title(s)",
    "00, 00.1, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| No part of the roof of the extension shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",
    "Reason:  To protect the living conditions of nearby properties in accordance with policies D4 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013) and policies 1.1 (e)(g), 1.2 (f), 2.1(c) and 2.10 Core Strategy (2012). | Cycle storage for ^IN;  bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the development, within secure, lockable compounds in accordance with the designated locations identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and all adopted standards prior to the first occupation of the building. The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:  To provide adequate bicycle storage in accordance with policy and T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the designated location identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Aircraft Noise",
    "The site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57dB) (See Appendix 5 SPG10). Before the development is commenced, details shall be submitted for approval by the Council in writing, for the sound insulation of the building envelope, assessed according to the criteria specified in Section 6, Ealing Supplementary Planning Guidance 10, and not exceeding the internal noise limits for sensitive rooms in BS8233:2014. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise), in accordance with Authority's criteria. The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "The applicant is advised that no noise measurements are required. The aircraft noise impact and sound insulation of the building envelope should be based on the criteria given in Section 6 SPG10, in a table-top assessment by the chosen acoustic consultant.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies  policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Ealing SPG10. | External noise from machinery, equipment, extract/ventilation ducting, mechanical installations",
    "Prior to the commencement of the development (excluding initial site clearance demolition and ground works), details shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing, of plant/ machinery/ equipment/ducting/air in- and outlets/ mechanical installations and their external rating noise level (LAr,Tr), together with mitigation measures as appropriate. The measures shall ensure that the emitted external rating noise level will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity. Where required, a post installation sound assessment shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The assessment shall be carried out to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and shall include additional steps to mitigate noise as necessary.",
    "Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation/ use of plant/ machinery/ equipment and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason:   To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with  policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Ealing SPG10.",
    "| Anti- vibration mounts and silencing of machinery etc.",
    "Prior to use, machinery, plant and equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "Reason:  To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by vibration noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Ealing SPG10."
