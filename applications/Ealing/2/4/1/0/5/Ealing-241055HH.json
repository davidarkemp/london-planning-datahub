    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height and insubordinate scale, would be unsympathetic to the host dwelling's original scale and character, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal is contrary policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19), and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022). | The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height, size and proximity to the boundary, would result in in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development and adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19), and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
