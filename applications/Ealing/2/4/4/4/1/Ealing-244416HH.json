    "The proposed plans submitted with the application are noticeably inaccurate, and as such, the current application fails to demonstrate that it would harmonise with the character and appearance of the host dwelling. The impact of the development on the character of the area and host dwelling cannot be accurately determined and the proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7A, 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework. | The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its width would extend right to the boundary, covering the existing first floor rear elevation glazing, thereby resulting in bedroom 2 having no openable windows and outlook that would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents and resulting in a unsympathetic form of development to the host building. As such the development would be contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework. | The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its full width and maximum height would result in a scale, bulk and massing that is excessively large and insubordinate to the existing property  would create an incongruous addition to the host building, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with policy D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7A, 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022) and the National Planning Policy Framework."
