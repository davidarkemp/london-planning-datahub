    "The proposed plans submitted with the application are manifestly inaccurate, and as such, the proposed roof extension and part single, part two storey rear extension fails to demonstrate that it would harmonise with the character and appearance of the host dwelling. The impact of the development on the character of the area and host dwelling cannot be accurately determined and the proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7A, 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the NPPF."
