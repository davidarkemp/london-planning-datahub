    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing / document title number(s): Location Plan, ER.18.PR.01 PROPOSED Floor Plan, ER.18.PR.02 PROPOSED Elevations, ER.18.PR.03 PROPOSED Elevations, ER.18.PR.04 PROPOSED Elevations, ER.18.PR.05 PROPOSED Section A-A, ER.18.PR.SP PROPOSED Site Plan, ER.18.EX.01 EXISTING Floor Plan, ER.18.EX.02 EXISTING Elevations, ER.18.EX.03 EXISTING Elevations, ER.18.EX.04 EXISTING Elevations, ER.18.EX.05 EXISTING Section A-A, ER.18.EX.SP Site Plan",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "| The site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (60 dB) (See Appendix 5 SPG10). Before the development is commenced, a desk top study shall be submitted for approval by the Council in writing, for the sound insulation of the building envelope, based on the aircraft noise contour spectrum specified in Section 6 Supplementary Planning Guidance 10, and which will achieve the internal criteria for noise sensitive rooms. The details should also include the provision of alternative means of acoustically attenuated ventilation and cooling, as necessary, (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise), in accordance with the Council's criteria. The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) and Ealing SPG10.",
    "| The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) and Ealing SPG10.",
    "| Cycle storage for ^IN;  bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the development, within secure, lockable compounds in accordance with the designated locations identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and all adopted standards prior to the first occupation of the building. The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:  To provide adequate bicycle storage in accordance with policy and T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the designated location identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The residential units hereby approved shall at no time be converted from C3 residential to a C4 small HMO, notwithstanding the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 3 Class L of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order) without express planning permission having first been granted by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason: To prevent the overdevelopment of the site and to safeguard the living conditions of adjoining properties and visual appearance of the building, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
