    "The proposed front extension is considered to be unacceptable by reason of its siting and design and would represent incongruous form of development that would be out of character with the established pattern of development in the area, to the detriment of the visual amenity, the Norwood Green Conservation Area, and character of the wider area. Therefore, having regard to the above assessment, it is considered that the proposal is contrary with the policies of the London Plan (2021), the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013), Norwood Green Conservation Area Management Plan (2007)."
