    "The proposed development would result in substandard accommodation, as both Units 1 and 2 fail to meet minimum space standards and the required floor area for living, dining, and kitchen spaces. Unit 2 lacks private amenity space, and the study in Unit 1, which is large enough to be classified as a double bedroom, lacks openable windows, resulting in inadequate light, outlook, and ventilation. These issues would negatively impact the living conditions of future occupants and are contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 3.5 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the London Plan Guidance: Housing Design Standards (2023)."
