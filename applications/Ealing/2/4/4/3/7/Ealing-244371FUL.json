    "The proposal, by reason of its design, depth, scale, bulk and overall dimensions, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, that would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area.  The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing Housing Guidance (2022), and Policy DAA of Ealing's Draft Local Plan (Regulation 22). | The proposed outrigger extension and staircase, by reason of its siting, scale and proximity to No.48 Little Ealing Lane Ground Floor Flat and No.50 Little Ealing Lane would result in an unneighbourly and overbearing form of development, resulting in harm to the occupants of the adjoining property in terms of loss of light outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with policy 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D1, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DAA of Ealing's Draft Local Plan (Regulation 22)."
