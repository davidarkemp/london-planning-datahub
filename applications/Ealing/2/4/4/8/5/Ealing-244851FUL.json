    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the following drawings / document title number(s): 23-039-E01 (Existing OS Plan); 23-028-E02 (Existing Site Plan); 23-028-E03 (Existing Ground Floor Plan); 23-028-E04 (Existing Loft Floor Plan); 23-028-E05 (Existing Roof Plan); 23-028-E06 (Existing Front Elevation (North-West Facing)); 23-028-E07 (Existing Rear Elevation (South-East Facing)); 23-028-E08 (Existing Side Elevation (North-East Facing)); 23-028-E09 (Existing Street Context Elevations); 23-028-E10 (Existing Section A-A); 23-039-P01 (Proposed OS Plan); 23-039-P02 (Proposed Site Plan); 23-039-P03 (Proposed Ground Floor Plan); 23-039-P04 (Proposed First Floor Plan); 23-039-P05 (Proposed Loft Floor Plan); 23-028-P06 (Proposed Roof Plan); 23-028-P07 (Proposed Front Elevation (North-West Facing)); 23-028-P08 (Proposed Rear Elevation (South-East Facing)); 23-028-P09 (Proposed Side Elevation (North-East Facing)); 23-028-P10 (Proposed Street Context Elevations); 23-028-P11 (Proposed Section A-A); ARBORICULTURAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT; LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT; LANDSCAPE MASTERPLAN; LANDSCAPE STRATEGY; LANDSCAPING ROOF PLAN; UGF CALCULATION; TRANSPORT STATEMENT; CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN; BNG METRIC EXTRACTS; BNG STATEMENT; PLANNING DESIGN AND ACCESS STATEMENT.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| The materials used in the construction of the development shall be in accordance with the materials described in the submitted design & access statement and the approved plans",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be based on environmental noise levels occurring during most of the year, ie. measured during school and work weekdays. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal and external amenity noise levels shall not exceed the criteria set by BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

All detailed works shall be carried out as approved prior to the occupation of the premises. Such details shall include: the height and materials of the boundary treatment, the provision of planting in the forecourt and any new surfacing materials to be used.",
    "Reason:  To improve the visual amenity of the property through urban greening in accordance with policies 5.10 and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D8, G4 and G5 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Refuse and recycling storage areas indicated on the approved plans shall be provided and brought into use prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of the future occupants of the development in accordance with policies with policies 3.5 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan 2013, policies 1.1 (e) of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and The London Plan (2021) policy SI 7.",
    "| The cycle parking shown on the approved documents shall be brought into use prior to first occupation of the development and retained permanently.",

    "| Before the development is commenced (excluding site clearance, demolition, and ground works), details shall be submitted for approval by the Council in writing, for the sound insulation of the building envelope, based on the aircraft noise contour spectrum specified in Section 6 Supplementary Planning Guidance 10, and which will achieve the internal criteria for noise sensitive rooms. The details should also include the provision of alternative means of acoustically attenuated ventilation and cooling, as necessary, (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise), in accordance with the Council's criteria. The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site, in accordance with Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 3.5 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).",

    "| Each proposed dropped kerb shall have a maximum width of 2.4m, visibility splays",
    "of 1.5m by 1.5m, and free of obstructions higher than 0.6m within the visibility",
    "splays.",
    "Reason: In the interests of highway safety, in line with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Prior to commencement of the development, a demolition method statement/ construction management plan shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing. Details shall include control measures for:- - noise and vibration (according to Approved CoP BS 5228-1 and -2:2009+A1:2014), - dust (according to Supplementary Planning Guidance by the GLA (2014) for The Control of Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition), - lighting ('Guidance Note 01/20 For The Reduction Of Obtrusive Light' by the Institution of Lighting Professionals), - delivery locations, - hours of work and all associated activities audible beyond the site boundary restricted to 0800-1800hrs Mondays to Fridays and 0800 -1300 Saturdays (except no work on public holidays), - neighbour liaison, notifications to interested parties and considerate complaints procedure, - public display of contact details including accessible phone numbers for persons responsible for the site works for the duration of the works, in case of emergencies, enquiries or complaints.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise, vibration, dust, lighting or other emissions from the site, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD.",
    "| Prior to the commencement of development, a site Construction Logistics Plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The submission shall include the following:",

    "7. Locations for the storage of building materials and construction debris and contractors' offices;",
    "8. Procedures for on-site contractors to deal with complaints from local residents including the name, telephone number and address of a responsible person to whom enquiries / complaints should be directed.
