    "The proposed rear roof extension, by way of its scale, bulk, design and width, would result in an incongruous and dominant form of development to the application site within the Ealing Common Conservation Area.",
    "The full width roof extension would appear out of keeping and overbearing amongst the surrounding built environment and would result in demonstrable harm to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.",
    "As such, it is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its scale and design and would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) as well as the Generic Conservation Area Management Plan (2023)."
