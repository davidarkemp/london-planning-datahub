    "The proposed first floor side extension by reason of its scale, design, prominence, cumulative impact and visual impact would be an oversized and obtrusive form of development that would cause unacceptable disruption to the local roofscape, would be resulting in a cramped, unsympathetic form of development to the host building and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the local area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan (Reg22). | The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of siting in close proximity to the boundary would detrimentally harm the residential amenity of No. 21 Victoria Road, by way of loss of light, outlook and an overbearing development. Therefore, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), Policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan (Reg22)."
