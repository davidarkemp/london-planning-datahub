    "The proposed first floor extension, by way of its design, scale and siting, would constitute a contrived and incongruous addition to the host dwelling, that would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing Housing Guidance (2022), and Policy DAA of Ealing's Draft Local Plan (Regulation 22)."
