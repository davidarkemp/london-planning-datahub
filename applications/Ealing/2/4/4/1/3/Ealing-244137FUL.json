    "The proposed two storey building, by way of its overall scale and height, would have represent an unsympathetic and inappropriate form of development within the application site and the surrounding area. The proposed building would host facilities capable of operating as a self-contained unit and would not feature the scale or characteristics of an outbuilding ancillary or incidental to a single family dwellinghouse.",
    "As such, the proposed building fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed building, by way of its fenestrations and height, would create an elevated vantage point which would result in overlooking towards nos.20 and 24 Madeley Road, adversely impacting their residential amenity and their privacy conditions.",
    "As such, as the proposal would give rise to undue overlooking, this application fails to comply with policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
