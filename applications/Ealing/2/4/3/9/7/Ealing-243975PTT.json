    "The replacement tree must be planted where the existing tree is currently located by April 2026; the tree should be of a Yew (Taxus baccata) or Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and of a size not less than 10-12cm girth when planted.",
    "Reason: To ensure the continued amenity provided by the tree(s) and the planting of an appropriate species and in order to preserve the character and appearance of this part of Cleveland Road/Highview Road. | The tree work specified above must be carried out within 2 years of the date of this decision.",
    "Reason: To ensure the work is only carried out once in respect of this consent and allow Ealing Council the opportunity to reconsider its decision in the light of prevailing circumstances, and reconsult on the case in the event of the consent expiring before implementation."
