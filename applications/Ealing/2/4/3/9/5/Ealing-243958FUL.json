    "By way of its depth, total height and positioning within the road, the proposed first floor rear extension would appear overbearing and would enclose the streetscene to a greater extent, disrupting the existing open areas of Junction Road.",
    "In addition to the existing extensions to the application site, the cumulative impact of the extensions would constitute an incongruous development which would cause an overdevelopment of the site.",
    "As such, the proposed first floor rear extension would be unacceptable in terms of its scale and design and fails to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | By way of its depth, total height and the subsequent cumulative development to the application site, the proposed first floor rear extension would cause a sense of enclosure and overshadowing to no. 64 Carlyle Road and would have an adverse impact on their residential amenity by way of loss of light to their rear windows and rear garden.",
    "As such, it is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its impacts on neighbouring amenity and would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
