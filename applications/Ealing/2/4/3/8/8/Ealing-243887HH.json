    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its height, that is not proportionate to its intended use would fail to harmonise with the surrounding area and would constitute an overbearing and unsympathetic form of development resulting in a harmful impact to the local character of the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), National Planning Policy Framework (2023) and Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan (Reg19)."
