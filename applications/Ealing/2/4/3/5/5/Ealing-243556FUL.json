    "The proposed outbuilding by virtue of its internal layout and use as a separate, self-contained residential unit, would fail to be satisfactorily ancillary to the main dwelling and would be out of keeping with the character of its back garden setting. The proposed development when considered as a self-contained residential unit, due to lack of private amenity space and single aspect windows would result in a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupants, contrary to the NPPF (2023), policies D1, D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and policies 7.4, 7B and 7D  of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
