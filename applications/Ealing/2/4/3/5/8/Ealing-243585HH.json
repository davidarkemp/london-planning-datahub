    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, siting and design of the rear dormer roof extension  would result in an incongruous development that over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the property's original scale and character, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property and the local area. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7.B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19) and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance."
