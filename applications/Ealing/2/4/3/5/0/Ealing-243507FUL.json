    "The proposed HMO development, by reason of a lack of internal communal area, inadequate cycle parking provision, insufficient bedroom design that would result in loss of privacy to the future occupiers of flats 4,5 and 6 would constitute a substandard and unsustainable form of development, that would provide poor quality living conditions for future residents. The proposed communal kitchen would not be provided with a window for natural light and ventilation, resulting in poor quality living conditions for the future occupants. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies D4, D6, T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021), the Technical Housing Standards, Council's HMO Licensing requirements and the Mayor's Housing SPG. | The proposed rear roof extension by reason of scale, width, height, bulk, prominence and visual impact would be an oversized, obtrusive and illogical form of development that would cause unacceptable disruption to the local roofscape, would detract from the amenity of the street and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposed development is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
