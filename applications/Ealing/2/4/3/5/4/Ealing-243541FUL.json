    "The proposed development by reason of the number of occupants, layout and design, over-intensification of the residential use of the host building, and low PTAL would harm neighbourhood amenity and provide a poor quality of living conditions for future occupants, especially the occupants on the ground level near the communal areas. Inconsistencies within the submitted plans also undermine the evidence that the living conditions within the property would be realised during the construction process. As such, the proposed development would be contrary to Policies D6, D14, and T5 of The London Plan (2021), Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Ealing Council's Standards for Houses in Multiple Occupation (2016). | The proposed development would not be the best use of the housing stock and not contribute to a mixed and inclusive neighbourhood due to removing one of the few remaining family-sized dwellinghouses from the area and contributing to the present oversupply of Houses in Multiple Occupation along the western side of Emanuel Avenue. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policies H9 and H10 of The London Plan (2021)."
