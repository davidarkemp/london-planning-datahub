    "Prior to occupation of uses falling under E(g)(iii) (Industrial processes), details shall be submitted for the approval of the Local Planning Authority, of the composite sound reduction index, Rw, for the building envelope demonstrating that noise from uses and activities is contained within the building, with windows and doors closed and other means of ventilation provided. The assessment shall be according to standards of the Council's SPG10 and noise limits specified by BS8233:2014, at the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises incl. private external amenity spaces. The approved sound insulation and ventilation shall be implemented before the development is commenced and retained permanently thereafter.",
