    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing / document title number(s):  E002 Existing Elevations, E003 Existing Elevations, E004 Existing Section, L001 Location Plan, P001 Proposed Block Plan, P002 Proposed Floorplans, P003 Proposed Floorplans, P004 Proposed Elevations, P005 Proposed Elevations, P006 Proposed Section, EBP001 Existing Block Plan, PBP001 Proposed Block Plan.",

    "| The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the designated location identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Cycle storage for ^IN;  bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the development, within secure, lockable compounds in accordance with the designated locations identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and all adopted standards prior to the first occupation of the building. The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:  To provide adequate bicycle storage in accordance with policy and T5 of the London Plan (2021). | No part of the roof of the extension shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",
    "Reason:  To protect the living conditions of nearby properties in accordance with policies D4 and D6 of The London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan Document (2013) and policies 1.1 (e)(g), 1.2 (f), 2.1(c) and 2.10 Core Strategy (2012). | Transport and/or commercial/industrial/cultural noise sources",
    "The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be based on environmental noise levels occurring during most of the year, ie. measured during school and work weekdays. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal and external amenity noise levels shall not exceed the criteria set by BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the units and neighbouring amenity in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of the London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Separation of noise sensitive rooms from other uses",
    "Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of enhanced sound insulation values of at least 5dB above the ADE Building Regulations values, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, namely, bedroom below/above kitchen/living/dining/bathroom of separate flat and of at least 10dB enhancement for bedrooms adjoining the communal main entrance and staircase to upper flat. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of the London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Notwithstanding the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 3 Class L of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (or any order revoking and re-enacting that Order), the residential unit hereby approved shall at no time be converted from C3 residential to a C4 small HMO, without express planning permission having first been granted by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "Reason:  To prevent the overdevelopment of the site and to safeguard the living conditions of adjoining properties and visual appearance of the building, in accordance with policies 3.5, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3, D4, and D6 and of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
