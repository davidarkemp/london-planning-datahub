    "The proposed change of use to short stay visitor accommodation would result in loss of housing supply, be at odds with the prevailing residential character, and undermine community cohesion in the area. The provision of visitor accommodation outside of a town centre or economic cluster would reduce the demand of purpose-built visitor accommodation in more appropriate locations, thus undermining the policy objectives seeking to capitalise on agglomeration effects and vitalise town centre. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3, H1, H9 and E10 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023. | The proposed change of use would cause unacceptable detrimental impact on neighbours' residential amenity, by reason of the noise, disturbance and car parking proliferation arising from comings and goings at all hours of the day and night associated with the use. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3, D6 and T6.4 of the London Plan 2021, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013 and the NPPF 2023."
