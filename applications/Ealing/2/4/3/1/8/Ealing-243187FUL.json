    "The proposed back garden development, by reason of its siting, layout, scale, bulk, and design within the rear gardens of 16 and 18 Somerset Road would represent a dominant and incongruous form of development that would result in the overdevelopment of this site and reduce the spaciousness of the overall locality, to the detriment of the visual amenity, character of the wider area and Ealing Green Conservation Area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development by reason of its scale and siting, would result in a harmful visual impact on the residential amenities of No. 24, 26 and 28 Lavington Road contrary to Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), and policies 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development due to length, distance, unlevel ground, would result in an unwelcoming, inappropriate, impracticable, access to the dwellinghouse, would result in detrimental and unsuitable living conditions . Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, London Housing Design Guidance 2023, policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing DPD 2013  and Housing SPG 2016. | The information submitted fails to demonstrate the protection of a mature tree in the neighbouring property No. 24 Lavington Road. Therefore, the existing development is contrary D4, D6 and Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), Policy 5.10 Ealing Local Variation, and policies 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposal, due to the location of the cycle storage and bin storage, and the impractical access  to it, would result in inadequate cycle and bin storage provisions adopted by the Local Planning Authority, contrary to policies T3, T5, SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), as well as the National Planning Policy Framework (2023)."
