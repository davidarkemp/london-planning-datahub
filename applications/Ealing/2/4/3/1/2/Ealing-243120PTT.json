    "The proposed works go beyond the recommendations set out in British Standard 3998:2010 Tree Work - Recommendations, section 7.7.2.  Healthy and structurally sound trees are capable of tolerating crown reductions of 30% of leaf volume, which is detailed as approximately 12% of branch length (allowing for variation in species).  The proposed works go well beyond this maximum level and as no information has been provided to show special/exceptional reasons (subsidence damage, structural damage to the tree, etc.) for such a level of reduction the works are refused.",
    "The oak tree in question is of significant age, and the proposed reduction of 3 metres is considered excessive. Mature oak trees typically require careful and minimal intervention to preserve their health and structural integrity. A reduction of this magnitude could negatively impact the tree's vitality and aesthetic value."
