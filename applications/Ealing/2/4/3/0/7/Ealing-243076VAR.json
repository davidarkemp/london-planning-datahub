    "The proposed amendments cannot be accepted as a minor material amendments to planning permission reference 223366FUL dated 15/02/2023, in accordance with Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for 'Minor material Amendments following grant of planning permission', on the following grounds: the proposed alteration to the red line boundary would result in a materially different scheme to that approved under the substantive application, to the detriment of the quantum and quality of communal amenity space to be provided, and through the awkward subdivision of the plot being out of keeping with the character and appearance of the conservation area and the locality. As such, the proposal the proposal completely alters the nature of the development and is therefore contrary to policies HC1, D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7C, 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Ealing Green Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and Ealing's Protocol for Minor Material Amendments following grant of planning permission (2015)."
