    "he proposed development by way of a conversion to two flats, by reason of the substandard size and width of one bedroom within flat 2, inadequate layout to make provision for cycle parking, refuse storage and outdoor amenity space would result in substandard amenity and living conditions for future occupants. The development is therefore contrary to the policies 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies H9, D1, D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The proposed extensions, by reason of their depth, scale, siting, proximity to boundaries, design, rear garden coverage and cumulative impact by joining onto an existing addition would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the building's original scale and character, and which results in the overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and local area. The development would therefore fail to comply with D3, D4 of the London Plan (2021), and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
