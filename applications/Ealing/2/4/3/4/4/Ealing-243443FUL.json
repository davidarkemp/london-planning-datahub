    "Design & Access Statement, Existing First Floor Plan, Existing Ground Floor Plan, Existing Site Plan, Existing Elevations, Location Plan, Proposed Elevations, Proposed First Floor Plan, Proposed Ground Floor Plan, Pierced Brick Enclosure, Proposed Site Plan, Proposed Elevations",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Prior to the commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing, of plant/ machinery/ equipment/ducting/air in- and outlets/ mechanical installations and their external rating noise level (LAr,Tr), together with mitigation measures as appropriate. The measures shall ensure that the emitted external rating noise level will be no higher than the existing ambient sound levels at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "At non-residential noise sensitive receivers, the noise levels emitted at the site shall not exceed the noise limits specified in BS8233:2014.",
    "Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation/ use of plant/ machinery/ equipment and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Prior to use, machinery, plant and equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",

    "| Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of the plant noise levels, and an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 10dB/ 15dB, as necessary above the ADE Building Regulations value for residential use, of the floor/ ceiling/ walls separating the plant room from the dwelling. The characteristics of any plant noise source shall not exceed a Noise Rating level of NR20 Leq 5mins (octaves) inside habitable rooms. Details shall include the installation method and materials of separating structures and any additional mitigation measures, together with the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound level within dwellings. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Policies E7.A.7 DM DPD, Standard 30 London Housing SPG 2016 and Policy D14 London Plan.",
    "| Metal gate posts and gates shall be installed with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and soft closing mechanism including resilient pads to adequately buffer noise from the operation of the gates. The gate posts and gates, while open or closed, shall not come in contact with external parts of adjacent buildings, to prevent structural and airborne noise or vibration being transmitted to noise sensitive premises.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from the operation of gates or associated mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2023).",
    "| Prior to commencement of the development, details of external artificial lighting shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing. Lighting contours shall be submitted to demonstrate that the vertical illumination of residential premises at and near the application site is in accordance with the recommendations for Environmental Zone 3 of the Institution of Lighting Professionals in the 'Guidance Note 01/20 For The Reduction Of Obtrusive Light'.  Details should also be submitted for approval of measures to minimise the use/hours of lighting and prevent glare and sky glow by correctly using, locating, aiming and shielding luminaires. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation/use of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
