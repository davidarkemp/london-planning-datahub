    "The proposed development, by reason of the design, scale, bulk, forward projection and massing of the two-storey side extension, would result in an incongruous development that over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the property's original scale and character, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property and the visual amenity of the local area. It would also harm the setting and significance of the Ealing Green Conservation Area. As such, the proposal fails to accord with Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7.B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of Ealing's draft Local Plan (Regulation 19) and the Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
