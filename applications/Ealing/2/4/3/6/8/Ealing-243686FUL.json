    "The proposed balcony, by reason of its location and design, would create incongruous addition to the roof of the host building and fail to respond to the existing roof design of the host building and the neighbouring properties, to the detriment of the design, character and appearance of the host dwelling and local area. As such, the proposal is contrary policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19), and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
