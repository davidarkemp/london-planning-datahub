    "The proposed car parking spaces and crossovers, by reason of its design and appearance, would result in a form of intrusive development of the subject site which would adversely affect the character of the original dwellinghouse as well as the character of the area and the visual amenity of the street scene. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The proposed crossover and associated parking space, by reason of its excessive dropped kerb width and excessive parking space in addition to the existing parking spaces would compromise pedestrian safety and highway users, reduce the provision of on-street parking. The development would therefore be contrary to London Plan 2021 policy T6, policy 1.1 (f) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and Application Pack for Residents\" (dated July 2021). | The submitted drawings have provided misrepresentations between location plan and proposed site plan. Hence, the Council is unable to fully assess the proposed development and in the absence of accurate and consistent details it is considered that the proposed development would be inconsistent with the objectives of Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
