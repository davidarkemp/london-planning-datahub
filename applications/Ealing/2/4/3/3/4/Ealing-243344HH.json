    "The proposed extension, by reason of its failure to harmonise within the provision set in the Cuckoo Estate Appraisal and Management plan, would result in incongruous additions, resulting in the overdevelopment of this site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and surrounding area and the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers.  As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Chapter 12, the London Plan (2021) policies D3 and D4, the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B and SPD 4 - Residential extensions."
