    "The replacement trees (for T1 & T5 only) must be planted where the existing tree's currently are located by April 2026; the tree should be of a Betula Spp. of any variety which will be more suited to the site and of a size not less than 10-12cm girth when planted. No replacement is required for T3.",
    "Reason: To ensure the continued amenity provided by the tree(s) and the planting of an appropriate species and in order to preserve the character and appearance of this part of Perth Close/Northolt Park.",
