    "The proposed annexe, by virtue of its internal layout and use as a separate, self-contained residential unit, would fail to be satisfactorily ancillary to the main dwelling and harmfully incongruous to the overall character of the area contrary to the National Planning Practice Framework (2023) (Updated) - Section 12, policies D1, D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies G5 and DAA of Ealing's Local Plan (Reg.19) and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance 2022.",
    "| The proposed development, due to its lack of private outdoor amenity space and the failure to meet the minimum internal floorspace standard, would result in a poor standard of accommodation for future occupants. The proposal would not comply with the national Planning Policy framework 2023 (Updated) - section 12, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7D and 3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) or the London Plan Guidance Housing Design Standards (2023)"
