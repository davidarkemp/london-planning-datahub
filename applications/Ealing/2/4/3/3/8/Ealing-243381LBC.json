    "The proposed replacement of single-glazed timber windows with double-glazed timber windows to all elevations on the second storey only, by reason of insufficient information submitted by the applicant, would result fail to show that existing window details are replicated sufficiently. The details submitted are therefore inadequate to demonstrate that the proposal would not have a detrimental impact on the character, appearance and visual amenity of the host building, as well as the wider Conservation Area. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policies D3, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
