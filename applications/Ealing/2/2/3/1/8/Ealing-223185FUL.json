    "The use of the garden outbuilding as a separate residential dwelling would be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development to the detriment of the character of the area and would be detrimental to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The development would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies H9, D1, D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The use of the outbuilding as a separate residential dwelling would provide substandard living conditions to the detriment of the amenities of future occupiers. As such, it is contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proposed development is within a Controlled Parking Zone. The proposal, which would increase the number of residential units on the site, would be likely to increase the demand for on-street parking and exacerbate car-parking stress in the area. Inadequate information was submitted regarding parking to allow the Local Planning Authority to assess whether the application site would be suitable from a highway point of view for the development proposed. Furthermore, no cycle parking is shown on site as part of the proposal. As such, the proposal is contrary to polices T5, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021)."
