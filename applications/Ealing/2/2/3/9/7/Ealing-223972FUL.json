Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10. Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. The approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
