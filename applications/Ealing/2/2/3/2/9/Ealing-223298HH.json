    "The proposed crossover, by reason of its excessive width would comprise upon pedestrian use of the public footway and highway users and cause detrimental harm to highway and pedestrian safety. As such, the proposed development would fail to adhere to the Council's Vehicle Crossovers: Application Pack for Residents (2016), policy T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), and policy 1.1 of the Ealing Local Development Framework - Adopted (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed crossover would result in a loss of grass verge within the street resulting in undue impacts on the character and amenity of the street scene and creating a harmful precedent for future development in the area. As such, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the NPPF (2021) paragraphs 134 and 135."
