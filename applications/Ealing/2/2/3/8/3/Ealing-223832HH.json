    "The proposed projection above the closet wing, by virtue of its siting, size, scale and massing as well as the relationship with its context would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. The overall depth and proportions of this change would unduly draw the eye and would be a harmful and incongruous feature. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proposed single storey side extensions due to the siting and height along the boundary of number 20A Grove Road would likely to result in undue loss of outlook to the openings to the side and rear of this neighbouring property. It would also harmfully enclose the patio area next to the proposed extension. It would therefore adversely affect the residential amenity of this neighbouring occupier contrary to London Plan (2021) policy D6 and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
