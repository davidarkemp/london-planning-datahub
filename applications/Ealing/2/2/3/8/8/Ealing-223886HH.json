    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its scale, siting, design and visibility from the public realm, particularly at first floor level, would result in an incongruous addition to the host property that would be out of keeping with the pattern of development of the area, to the detriment of the architectural integrity of the original dwellinghouse and the character and appearance of the Cuckoo Estate Conservation Area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the Cuckoo Estate Conservation Area Management Plan."
