    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, width, shape and design, would represent an overbearing, unsympathetic and incongruous addition to the host dwelling that would be out of keeping with the surrounding area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property and wider area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1, 2.1 and 2.10 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy 2012; policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan DPD (2013), and Interim Guidance SPD4 Residential Extensions. | The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its depth, width, height, and side facing window at first floor level, would represent an unneighbourly and overbearing form of development and would result in a loss of sunlight/daylight to habitable room windows and a loss of privacy from direct overlooking, all to the detriment of the amenity of occupiers of 16 Tavistock Avenue. As such, the proposal would be contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D1, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
