    "The proposed development, by reason of the loss of the distinctive bay window/chimney feature at ground floor level, the sitting, design, excessive width, appearance and scale of the single storey rear extension and inadequate information regarding the front garden works would result in undue harm to architectural integrity and special character of the dwellinghouse as well as the character of the the Hanger Hill (Haymill) Estate Conservation Area, thereby failing to preserve or enhance that character. The harm caused to the significance of the conservation area is less than substantial, however there are no public benefits provided that outweigh this harm. This fails to comply with Paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Plan (2008)."
