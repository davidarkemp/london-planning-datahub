    "The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its design, scale, siting, appearance and excessive width combined with the approved plans under Ref: the first floor element would be over-dominant and would represent an incongruous and obtrusive overdevelopment, adversely affecting the architectural integrity of the original dwelling, as well as visual amenity and character of the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and SPD4 (Residential Extensions). | The proposed development due to its design, scale and siting would result in adverse residential impacts by way of loss of light, outlook or increased feeling of enclosure upon the amenity of the adjoining neighbouring residents No. 16 Nutfield Gardens therefore it is considered that the proposal is contrary with policies D3, D4 and of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 of the Adopted Ealing Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012)."
