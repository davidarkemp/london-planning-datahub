    "1\tThe proposed rear roof extension, by reason of its design, scale, bulk, appearance and dominance would constitute an incongruous and unsympathetic development to the detriment of the visual amenity and historic character of the dwellinghouse as well as that of the Conservation Area. The proposed bay window and external alterations through their design, appearance and inconsistency with the street scene would also constitute a harmful development to the detriment of the character of the conservation area. The development therefore fails to comply with the NPPF (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), polices 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area Management Plan."
