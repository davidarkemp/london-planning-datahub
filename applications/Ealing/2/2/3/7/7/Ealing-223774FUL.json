Confirmation of submission to the GLA shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority, prior to occupation.",
    "c)\tSpecific commitments detailed in the Circular Economy statement produced by Atelier Ten in January 2023 (version 4), and accompanying Logistic Plans, should be implemented, including; diverting 95% of construction waste from landfill, putting 95% of excavation materials to beneficial on or off-site use, and diverting the London Plan target of 65% of Operational Waste from landfill by 2030.",
    "Reason: In the interests of sustainable waste management and in order to maximise the appropriate re-use and recycling of materials in line with London Plan Policy D3 (Optimising site capacity), SI7 (Reducing waste), SI2 (Minimising greenhouse gas emissions).",
    "| a)\tThe non-residential element of the development shall be registered with Building Research Establishment (BRE) and achieve BREEAM Rating \"Outstanding/Excellent\" for the New Broadway Connection office building (based on BREEAM NC 2018 guidance for Shell and Core), BREEAM rating \"Excellent\" for 35 The Broadway office (based on BREEAM NC 2018 guidance for Shell and Core), BREEAM rating minimum \"Very Good\" for new Broadway Connection retail and 35 The Broadway retail (based on BREEAM NC 2018 guidance for Shell only), and BREEAM minimum rating \"Very Good\" for 25-29 The Broadway retail and 9-16 The Broadway retail (based on BREEAM RFO 2014 guidance).",
    "b)\tWithin 3 months of completion of each non-residential element of the development, Interim BREEAM NC Assessment and related Certification verified by the BRE shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval.",
    "c)\tWithin 6 months from the date of first occupation of each non-residential element of the development, BREEAM 'Post Construction Stage' Assessment and related Certification verified by the BRE should be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for written approval confirming the BREEAM standard and measures have been implemented.",
    "Reason: In the interest of addressing climate change and to secure sustainable development in accordance with policies SI2 and SI3 of the London Plan (2021), and the relevant guidance notes in the GLA Energy Assessment Guidance 2020, policies LV5.2 and 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013, and policies 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2012, policies LV5.2 and 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013, and Policies 1.1(k) and 1.2(f) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012.",
    "| The sound insulation of the office building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed and implemented with regard to the Council's standard in the SPG10 and noise limits of BS8233:2014, including aircraft noise - worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57/60 dB) (as per Section 6, SPG10).  If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve criteria specified in BS8233:2014. The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), E"
