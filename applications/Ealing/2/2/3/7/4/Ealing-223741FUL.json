    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, design and relationship with its context would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. The proposed design with its flat roof would unduly draw the eye and would be a harmful and incongruous feature within the street scene. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The siting of the proposed extension would remove the existing parking spaces which when coupled with the additional seating (located in the new extension), could increase parking pressure on the surrounding roads. The impact caused through the removal of the parking spaces has not been justified or confirmed through items such as a parking survey. The removal of the spaces would therefore cause harm and would be contrary to Planning Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021."
