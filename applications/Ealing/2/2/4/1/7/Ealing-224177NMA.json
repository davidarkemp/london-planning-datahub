    "The details of any additional measures to be incorporated within the relevant plot (or part therein) to reduce the risk of overheating (without active cooling) shall also be submitted if the dynamic thermal modelling demonstrates for the relevant plot (or part therein) that overheating would occur. Compliance with Building Regulations  Part O should be also demonstrated and the actual cooling demand (kW/m2) of the non-residential space within the relevant plot (or part therein) should be demonstrated to be reduced compared to the notional wherever possible. The development within the relevant plot (or part therein) shall thereafter be provided in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development hereby approved is energy efficient and to reduce the risk of overheating in line with policy SI 4 of the London Plan 2021, adopted Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2026 (2012) and Development Management DPD (December 2013).",

    "B) Within three-months of the practical completion of the relevant plot (or part therein) of the development hereby approved, Energy Performance Certificates and detailed modelling output reports for the relevant plot (or part therein) showing clearly the DER and BER/TER from the \"as built stage\" to confirm compliance in terms of savings achieved through energy efficiency measures shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.",
    "C) Within three-months of the practical completion of the relevant plot of the development hereby approved, evidence that the renewable/low carbon technology(ies) within the relevant plot (or part therein) is certified under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MSC) and, if appropriate, complies with the Enhanced Capital Allowances (ECS) product criteria shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority unless otherwise agreed in writing.",
    "D) Each reserved matters application shall be accompanied by an updated energy strategy taking into account the energy hierarchy contained in the London Plan 2021 (or its successor document) setting out how the relevant plot (or part therein) incorporates and maintains measures to achieve as a minimum the targeted reduction in regulated CO2 emissions against  Building Regulations Part L 2013, as set out in the approved Energy Statement V4 (19/07/18) prepared by AECOM, within the relevant plot (or part therein). Prior to the final completion of the relevant plot (or part therein) of the development hereby approved the approved dwellings and non-residential space in that plot (or part therein) shall incorporate and maintain all carbon emission saving measures set out in the updated energy strategy for the relevant plot (or part therein).",
    "E) Measures to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions associated with other energy uses not covered by Building Regulations (un-regulated) should be incorporated prior to occupation of the relevant plot (or part therein) and maintained within the relevant plot (or part therein) in perpetuity as detailed in the approved Energy Strategy V4 (19/07/18) and Sustainability Statement V2 (19/07/18) prepared by AECOM (or as updated as part of the reserved matters submission for a relevant plot (or part therein)).
