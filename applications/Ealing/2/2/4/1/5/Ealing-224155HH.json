    "The proposed extensions, due to their scale, appearance and cumulative impact would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached properties and their symmetry and would be harmful to the visual amenities of the area.

As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - Section 12, policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
