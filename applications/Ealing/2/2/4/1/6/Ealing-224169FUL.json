    "| Prior to the first use of the gym outside the hours of 07:00 - 23.00, an acoustic report shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, detailing the following:",
    "- the sound insulation performance of the floor, ceiling and walls separating the gym from adjoining, commercial and/or residential premises;",
    "- anti-vibration fittings and/or other mitigation measures required for the isolation of exercise equipment, loudspeakers and floors in areas for exercise classes, weights, machines;",
    "- details to demonstrate that noise from the use of the gym including music, instructor's voices, group exercise classes, activities and use of equipment does not exceed",
    "NR25 Lmax(fast) from structure borne / impact noise",
    "NR20 Leq,5min from general airborne activity noise (including music)",

The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all machinery in any one location operating together at maximum capacity. Details of any noise mitigation measures shall be submitted for approval.
