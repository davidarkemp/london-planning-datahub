Such facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To encourage the use of sustainable transport, provide for adequate cycle parking facilities and to safeguard the appearance of the property and the amenities of the area, in accordance with Policies D4, T1, T2, T4 and T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material and safeguard the appearance of the property and the amenities of the area, in accordance with Policies D4 and SI 8 of the London Plan (2021) and 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | Prior to the commencement of the development, a Ventilation Strategy Report to mitigate the impact of existing poor air quality for residents shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The report will contain details for the installation of a filtered fresh air ventilation system capable of mitigating elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in the external air for all residential dwellings.",

If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall not exceed noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
