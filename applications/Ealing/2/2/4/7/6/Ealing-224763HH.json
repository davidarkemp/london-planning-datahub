    "The proposed dropped kerb, by reason of the inadequate depth and width of the forecourt which is an inadequate size to allow a vehicle to enter and exit the site in a forward gear and its location adjacent to an existing bus stop, would result in an access arrangement that would be detrimental to highway safety and likely to result in a danger to highway users. As such, the proposed development would fail to adhere to the Council's Vehicle Crossovers: Application Pack for Residents (2021), Policies D8, G7, T2 and T4 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 1.1 of the Ealing Local Development Framework - Adopted (Core) Strategy (2012)."
