    "The proposed retrospective outbuilding, by reason of inclusion of kitchen facilities could be used as a separate residential unit. Therefore, it would be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development to the detriment of the character of the area and would result in unreasonable impacts into the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of noise and disturbance. The development would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies H9, D1, D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposed ground floor and upper floor flats by reason of the inadequate access to daylight & sunlight, ventilation to flat A, and lack of garden amenity space and insufficient total gross internal floor area to flat B, would result in substandard living conditions, to the detriment of future occupiers. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
