    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of detailed in the submitted application form and approved drawings and documents listed under condition 2.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | No part of the development hereby approved shall be occupied until cycle parking facilities for eight (8) bicycles have been provided within the curtilage of the application site. Such facilities shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To encourage the use of sustainable transport, provide for adequate cycle parking facilities and to safeguard the appearance of the property and the amenities of the area, in accordance with Policies D4, T1, T2, T4 and T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material and safeguard the appearance of the property and the amenities of the area, in accordance with Policies D4 and SI 8 of the London Plan (2021) and 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | Prior to the commencement of the development, a Ventilation Strategy Report to mitigate the impact of existing poor air quality for residents shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The report shall contain details for providing fresh air ventilation to habitable rooms on the Hammond Rd and facing the Norwood Rd facade, the supply to be provided from the rear of the building at high level.",
    "The report shall also include the following information:",
    "a) Details and locations of the ventilation intake locations of all floors",
    "b) Details and locations of ventilation extracts locations of all floors",
    "The maintenance and cleaning of the systems shall be undertaken regularly in accordance with manufacturer specifications and shall be the responsibility of the primary owner of the property. Approved details shall be fully implemented prior to the occupation/use of the development and thereafter permanently retained and maintained.",
    "Reason: To minimise exposure to existing poor air quality and provide a suitable internal living environment for future occupiers, in accordance with policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021, policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Development Strategy 2026 DPD (2012); and policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).",
    "| All Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) of net power of 37kW and up to and including 560kW used during the course of the demolition, site preparation and construction phases shall comply with the emission standards set out in chapter 7 of the GLA's supplementary planning guidance \"Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition\" dated July 2014 (SPG), or subsequent guidance. Unless it complies with the standards set out in the SPG, no NRMM shall be on site, at any time, whether in use or not, without the prior written consent of the local planning authority. The developer shall keep an up to date list of all NRMM used during the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development on the online register at https://nrmm.london/.",
    "Reason: To safeguard adjoining occupiers of the development against unacceptable noise, disturbance and emissions, policies 1.1(j) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), Local Variation policy 3.5 and policy 7A of Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policy SI1 of the London Plan(2021); and National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed and implemented with regard to the Council's standards in the SPG10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason:   To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | Prior to use, machinery, plant and equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",

    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise, vibration, dust, lighting or other emissions from the site, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | No development approved by this planning permission shall be commenced until:",
    "a) A desktop study has been carried out which shall include the identification of previous site uses, potential contaminants that might reasonably be expected given those uses and other relevant information.
