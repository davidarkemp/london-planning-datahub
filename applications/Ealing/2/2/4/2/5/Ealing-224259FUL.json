    "The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate footprint, the excessive number of dwellinghouses, volume and scale would constitute in a bulky, incongruous and over dominant development harming the character and appearance of the area. The development would therefore fail to comply with the NPPF (2021), policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the London Housing SPG 2016. | The proposed  development by reason of excessive parking provision, siting and proximity of the vehicle and pedestrian access road to the neighbouring properties No. 94 and 92 Ferrymead Avenue, would lead to excessive noise and disturbance levels from the vehicles and pedestrians to detriment of the amenities of the neighbouring property No. 94 and 92 Ferrymead Avenue. Therefore, would fail to comply to policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), Policy 5.10 Ealing Local Variation, and policies 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development by reason of excessive scale and proximity to the rear garden of neighbouring property No. 114 Ferrymead Avenue, would result in an unreasonable impact in terms of loss of light and overshadowing, and therefore would fail to comply to policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), Policy 5.10 Ealing Local Variation, and policies 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development by reason of excessive scale and sitting, would result in an unacceptable impact on the visual amenities and loss of the existing sense of openness of the land of the neighbouring properties No. 92, 94 and 112, contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D4, D6 and G7 of the London Plan 2021, policies 7C and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposal development due to the inappropriate location of waste facilities, would result in a detrimental impact on the safety of the local transport network and the amenities of the neighbouring properties No. 94 and 92 Ferrymead Avenue. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to the Policies SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan (2021) and Ealing Council's Supplementary Planning Guidance 4 - Refuse and Recycling. | The proposed development by reason of its location and scale would result in unreasonable impact on the mature trees located on the rear garden of No. 90 Ferrymead Avenue, and therefore would fail to comply to policies D4, D6 and G7 of the London Plan 2021, Policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), Policy 5.10 Ealing Local Variation, and policies 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
