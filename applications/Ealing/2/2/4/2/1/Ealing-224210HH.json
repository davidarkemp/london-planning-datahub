    "The proposed rear roof extension by reason of scale, width, height, bulk, prominence and visual impact would be an oversized, obtrusive and illogical form of development that would cause unacceptable disruption to the local roofscape and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the original building and the area. The proposed two-storey side/rear wraparound extension by reason of its design, appearance, scale, bulk and window detail would result in a form of overdevelopment of the subject site which would adversely affect the character of the original dwellinghouse as well as the character of the area and the visual amenity of the street scene. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed two storey side/rear wraparound extension by reason of scale, bulk, prominence and siting would result in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development that would have an overbearing nature and lead to a loss of light, loss of outlook, and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties of nos. 39 Gibbon Road. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). |  The submitted planning application and drawings have provided misrepresentations between proposed front elevation plan and existing front elevation plan. Hence, the Council is unable to fully assess the proposed development and in the absence of accurate and consistent details it is considered that the proposed development would be inconsistent with the objectives of Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
