The details shall include the communal heat distribution loop schematics, the exact number of heat pumps, the heat pump thermal kilowatt output, heat output pipe diameter(s), parasitic load supply schematics, monthly energy demand profile, and the exact number of PV arrays, the kWp capacity of each array, the orientation, pitch and mounting of the panels, and the make and model of the panels. The name and contact details of the renewable energy installation contractor(s), and if different, the commissioning electrical or plumbing contractor, should be submitted to the Council prior to installation.",
    "c)\tOn completion of the installation of the renewable energy equipment copies of the MCS certificates and all relevant commissioning documentation shall be submitted to the Council.",

The monitored data shall be automatically submitted to the Council at daily intervals for a period of four years from occupation and full operation of the energy equipment. The installation of the monitoring devices and the submission and format of the data shall be carried out in accordance with the Council's approved specifications as indicated in the Automated Energy Monitoring Platform (AEMP) information document. The developer must contact the Council's chosen AEMP supplier (Energence Ltd) on commencement of construction to facilitate the monitoring process.",
    "c)\tUpon final completion of the development and prior to occupation, the developer must submit to the Council proof of a contractual arrangement with a certified contractor that provides for the ongoing, commissioning, maintenance, and repair of the renewable/low-carbon energy equipment for a period of four years from the point that the building is occupied and the equipment fully operational. Any repair or maintenance of the energy equipment must be carried out within one month of a performance problem being identified.",
    "Reason: To monitor the effectiveness and continued operation of the renewable/low carbon energy equipment in order to confirm compliance with energy policies and establish an in-situ evidence base on the performance of such equipment in accordance with London Plan (2021) policy SI2 (\"Be Seen\" stage of the energy hierarchy), Ealing's Development (Core) Strategy 2026 (3rd April 2012) and Development Management DPD policy 5.2, E5.2.3, and Policy 2.5.36 (Best Practice) of the Mayor's Sustainable Design & Construction SPG.",

    "Reason: To protect the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies G4, G5 and G7 of the London Plan, policy 5.10 of Ealing's Development Management DPD and Ealing's SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines. | No emergency diesel generators will be installed onsite without prior approval from the Local Planning Authority. Any new proposed diesel generators should demonstrate compliance with a minimum NOx emissions standard of 150mg/Nm-3 (at 5% O2) and must be submitted and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The details must include the results of NOx emissions testing of the diesel fuelled generator units by an accredited laboratory, emissions concentrations expressed at specific reference conditions for temperature, pressure, oxygen and moisture content under normal operating conditions. Where any combustion plant does not meet the relevant standard, it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology. Evidence of installation shall be required where secondary abatement is required to meet the NOx Emission standard 150mg/Nm-3 (at 5% O2). The emergency plant and generators hereby permitted may be operated only for essential testing, except when required in an emergency situation.",
    "Reason: To ensure the local authority meets its obligations to deliver air quality objectives for NO2 in accordance with London Local Air Quality Management (LLAQM), and to limit PM2.5 (fine particulates) to safeguard public health and well-being and external amenity of nearby sensitive receptors."
