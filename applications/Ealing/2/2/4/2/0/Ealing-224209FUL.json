    "The submitted drawings have failed to demonstrate the actual number of units on the site or the number of units that is being applied for. They also inaccurately reflect the height of the proposed roof-mounted refrigeration units. As such, the proposed units, by reason of their height, size, assembly and sitting, would cause harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | In the absence of a satisfactory noise assessment report, the proposal is highly likely to result in unacceptable levels of noise, vibration and emissions within close proximity to neighbouring residential occupiers, to the detriment of neighbouring amenity. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
