    "The proposed roof extension, by reason of its bulk, design, siting around the proposed first floor side extension and height above predominant massing of the roof and visibility from the street, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, that would cause significant detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the building and the surrounding area, as well as the visual amenity of the street scene. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan, Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and SPD4 (Residential Extensions). | The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of a lack of setback from the front elevation, as well as proximity to the side boundary, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development that would fail to achieve subordination with the host dwelling. The proposed replacement windows to the front elevation would also not be consistent with the design of windows on adjoining properties, failing to be consistent with the established fenestration pattern that exists along the northern side of Rosemont Road. Collectively, the proposal would be detrimental to the uniform appearance of the street, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenity of the street scene. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan, Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and SPD4 (Residential Extensions)."
