    "Reason: For avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",

    "| Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 10/15/20dB as necessary, above the Building Regulations value for residential use, of the floor/ ceiling/ walls separating the commercial kitchen extract and odour control system from dwellings. Where the noise includes characteristic features, the Noise Rating level should not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins (octaves) inside the dwelling. Details shall include the installation method and materials of separating structures and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound level. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 Noise and Vibration and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - sections 2 and 12, London Plan Standard 30 of the Housing SPG and Policy 7.15.",

The extract duct shall terminate vertically without cowl at least 1m above the eaves of the main building. Equipment and ducting shall be sited with anti-vibration mounts and silencers. Mitigation measures shall ensure that noise and vibration transmission to noise sensitive receivers via internal building elements and external façades will meet the Council's standards specified in the SPG10. The installation and mitigation measures shall be implemented prior to use and thereafter be permanently retained.",
