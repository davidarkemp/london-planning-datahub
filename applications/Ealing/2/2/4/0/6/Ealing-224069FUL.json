    "The proposed development, by virtue of its height being in excess of the existing dwellings on the site, leading to it being out of character to the context and character of the area particularly in relation to infill development on corner sites. This would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021. | The proposed development, by virtue of its height and bulk that would harmfully impact upon number 2 Selby Gardens. It would give rise to an unacceptable overbearing impact and reduce access to afternoon sunlight and daylight. It would be an unneighbourly form of development and would be contrary to section 12  of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development, by virtue of its height and siting in relation to the surrounding properties would cause a significantly harmful impact to the living conditions and garden areas of number 84 Westbury Avenue. There would also be a harmful increase in perceived overlooking to the adjacent properties. The  proposal is therefore contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy  Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan 2021. | The proposed development, by virtue of its amenity space provision in the front garden would not respond positively to the physical context or respect the established urban grain of the area. The amenity space would have very limited privacy from the public realm which would be contrary to policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013."
