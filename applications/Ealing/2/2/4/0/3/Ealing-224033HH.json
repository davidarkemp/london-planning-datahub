    "The proposed development, by reason of its design, the full width first-floor rear extension and the loss of the canted bay window and its hipped roof, would result in a development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to detriment of the appearance and character of the host dwelling and the historic character of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), The Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Character Appraisal (2008) and The Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Management Plan (2008). | The proposed development, by reason of the width and depth of the first-floor rear extension, would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, to the detriment of the visual amenities of occupants of No. 36 Corringway. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
