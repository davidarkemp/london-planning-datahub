    "The proposed second floor plan does not accurately reflect the width of the proposed roof extension and consequently fails to indicate the exact dimensions of the proposed development. The proposal therefore is contrary to National Planning Policy Framework 2021 - Section 12 Achieving well-design places, policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016, policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and Ealing Housing Design Guidance 2022. | The proposed rear roof dormer extension, by reason of its excessive width, depth and volume, would result in a dominant, overbearing and visually unsympathetic addition to the rear roof, to the detriment of the character, appearance and general pattern of development of the area. The proposal therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
