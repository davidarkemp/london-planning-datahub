    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, scale, siting, proximity to boundaries and design, would represent an overbearing, illogical and dominant addition to the host dwelling and would harm the visual amenities of neighbouring occupiers to the detriment of the character and appearance of the street scene and adjacent Conservation Area, and residential amenities. The development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3, D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing SPD4. | The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, location, material, and proposed use, would result in an incongruous form of development and fail to be ancillary of the main dwelling house to the detriment of the character and appearance of Creffield Conservation Area. As such, it is contrary to the NPPF (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and the Creffield Conservation Area Management Plan."
