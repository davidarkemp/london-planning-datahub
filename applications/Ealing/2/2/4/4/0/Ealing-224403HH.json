    "The proposal by reason of its design, bulk, scale and visual impact would not appear subordinate to the host dwelling. It would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Ealing Cricket Ground Conservation Area and would bring negative impact on the existing amenity space, which is considered to the detriment of the amenity of existing residents. As such the proposed development would be contrary to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), NPPF (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), polices 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and the Ealing Cricket Ground Management Plan. | The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, height, fenestrational detail, and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would appear overdominant and overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties, and would result in overlooking, loss of privacy and loss of light to those properties. As such the proposed development would be contrary to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), NPPF (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), polices 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and the Ealing Cricket Ground Management Plan."
