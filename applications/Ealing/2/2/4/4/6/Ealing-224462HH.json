  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey extension, by reason of its width, depth, siting, roof profile, design and fenestration, would result in the loss of special design features of the Conservation Area, would fail to respect the design and detailing of the original dwelling to the detriment of the special character of the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area. It therefore runs contrary to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3, D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Plan, the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area Policy & Design Guide (as amended 2012). | The proposed development, by reason of the insufficient information provided for windows and doors replacement, it would contrast sharply with neighbouring dwellings of a similar appearance, would appear illogical, would be at odds with the traditional setting, and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area. The development would therefore run contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the Brentham Garden Estate Conservation Area Policy & Design Guide (as amended 2012)."
