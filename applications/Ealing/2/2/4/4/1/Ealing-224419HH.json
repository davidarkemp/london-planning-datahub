    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their height, bulk, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4. | The proposed development, by reason of its plot coverage and proximity to site boundaries, would represent a cramped and incongruous form of development on the site, result in unacceptable loss of garden space to the existing family dwellinghouse on the application site and out of keeping with the general pattern of development in the area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
