    "1. Inadequate detail has been provided to confirm that the property has been vacant for a period of 3 months or more",
    "2. Inadequate detail has been provided to confirm that the space is within a Class E use. The existing plans show three separate storage units, despite there being only one retail use within the site. The site may therefore may have been associated with residential uses of the property, or may have been within a Class B8 use. No floor plans of the existing main building have been provided, to show how the space proposed for conversion relates to the Class E use.",
    "3. The property would rely solely on the rear shared access road, which provides rear access to other properties within the terrace. The width of the shared access road is insufficient to allow a vehcile and pedestrian to pass unimpeded. The access to the site would therefore be considered to be unsafe due to potential conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians",
    "4. No noise assessment has been submitted to demonstrate the impacts of noise from commercial premises on the intended occupiers of the development",
    "5. The applicant would be required to provide ground floor plans of the main building wihtin the site to demonstrate the relationship of the proposed development to other uses within the building",
    "6. No information has been provided on fire risks to future occupants"
