    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive depth, would result in an incongruous and over development and a cramped and incongruous form of development on this site, out of keeping with the general pattern of development in the area, impede upon the rear communal amenity, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the building and the conservation area .  As such the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B, 7C and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Mount Park Conservation Area Management Plan 2009.",
    "| The proposed single storey rear extension, by virtue of its excessive depth and in close proximity to the neighbouring property at no.13 Woodville Road, would result in an unduly detrimental and unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing appearance and a sense of enclosure impact on the neighbouring dwellinghouse and its garden. As such the proposal is contrary to Policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed development, by virtue of insufficient floor to ceiling height, inadequate and substandard form of private and communal external amenity space, would result in detrimentally substandard living conditions for prospective occupants. In addition, the proposal would result in a loss of outlook and create a sense of enclosure to the existing ground floor front flat and loss of enjoyment of the communal garden to the existing flats within the development site.  As such the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies D1, D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
