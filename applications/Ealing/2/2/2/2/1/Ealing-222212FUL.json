The sound insulation of the building envelope shall achieve the internal criteria for sensitive rooms, as specified in Section 6 of Supplementary Planning Guidance 10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building).  The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

The details to be submitted shall include the arrangements for continuously maintaining the operational efficiency of the system.  The ventilation system as approved shall be completed prior to occupation and shall be retained permanently thereafter.",
