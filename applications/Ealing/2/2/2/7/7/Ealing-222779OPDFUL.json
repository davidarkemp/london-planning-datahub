A post installation noise assessment shall be carried out at noise sensitive locations to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and additional steps to mitigate noise shall be taken as necessary. Details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing. Approved details shall be implemented prior to use of plant/ machinery/ equipment and thereafter be permanently retained.",

    "| Prior to their operation, details on all new installed diesel generators demonstrating compliance with a minimum NOx emissions standard of 150mg/Nm-3 (at 5% O2) must be submitted and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The details must include the results of NOx emissions testing of the diesel fuelled generator units by an accredited laboratory, emissions concentrations expressed at specific reference conditions for temperature, pressure, oxygen and moisture content under normal operating conditions. Where any combustion plant does not meet the relevant standard, it should not be operated without the fitting of suitable NOx abatement equipment or technology. Evidence of installation shall be required where secondary abatement is required to meet the NOx Emission standard 150mg/Nm-3 (at 5% O2). The emergency plant and generators hereby permitted may be operated only for essential testing, except when required in an emergency situation.",
