    "The proposed first-floor rear extension, by reason of its combined depth, width, mass, bulk and design, would result in an incongruous development which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the building's original scale and character, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and local area. As such, the proposal is contrary policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed first-floor rear extension, by reason of its combined depth, width, mass, bulk and design, would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, that would create an increased sense of enclosure and loss of daylight and sunlight for the occupants of No. 174 North Road. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
