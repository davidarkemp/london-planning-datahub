    "The proposed amendment does not meet Council's criteria for \"minor material\" amendments as the amendment would introduce new material operations to the development and would result in a change to the description of the development. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the outcome of Finney v Welsh Ministers [2019] EWCA Civ 1868 and Ealing's Protocol for Minor Material Amendments Following a Grant of Planning Permission. | The removal of condition 1 would result in a materially detrimental impact upon the living conditions of future occupiers and the character and appearance of the host site and local area. The development would therefore run contrary to policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 3.5, 7B, 7.4 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
