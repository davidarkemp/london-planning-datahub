    "| The detached outbuilding hereby approved shall be used only for domestic purposes incidental to the dwelling on this site, and shall not be used for separate habitable accommodation, letting or any commercial use. No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed at any time.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the development does not detract from the amenity of the adjoining properties, and to enable the Local Planning Authority to retain control over the use of the building in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Development Strategy (2012),",
    "policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)",

This penalty shall be sought, unless the Local Planning Authority has given written consent to any variation.",
    "Reason: To secure the protection throughout the time that development is being carried out, of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within and adjacent to the site which are of important amenity value to the local landscape, in accordance with policies D4 and G7 of the London Plan (2021)."
