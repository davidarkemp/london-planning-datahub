    "The proposed development, by reason of the window frame materials, removal of the brick pillars, and enlargement of window openings to the primary elevation, would contrast sharply with neighbouring dwellings of a similar appearance, would appear illogical, would be at odds with the traditional setting, and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area. The development would therefore run contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area Management Plan (2008)."
