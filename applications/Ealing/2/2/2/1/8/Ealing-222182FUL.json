    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the above drawings and documents.",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "| The cycle parking approved under planning permission ref: 212719FUL shall be implemented in full and available for use prior to the occupation of the proposed flats.",
    "Reason: To ensure that adequate cycle parking is provided, in accordance with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The refuse storage approved under planning permission ref: 212719FUL shall be implemented in full and available for use prior to the occupation of the proposed flats.",
    "Reason: To ensure that adequate cycle parking is provided, in accordance with Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed and implemented with regard to the Council's standard in the SPG10 and noise limits of BS8233:2014.  If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve criteria specified in BS8233:2014. The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD.",
    "| The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason:   To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policy D14 of the London Plan and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD.",
    "| Prior to use, machinery, plant and equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "Reason:  To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by vibration noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policy D14 of the London Plan and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an enhanced sound insulation value of at least 5dB above the maximum Building Regulations value, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, eg. kitchen/living/dining/bathroom above/below/adjoining bedroom of separate dwelling and bedrooms adjoining communal staircases. The assessment and mitigation measures shall have regard to standards of the Council's SPG10 and noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise, in accordance with Policy D14 of the London Plan and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD.",
    "| Prior to commencement of construction and demolition works, a detailed Demolition Method and Construction Management Plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The plan must detail the:",
    "- Phasing of all works;",
    "- On-site construction worker parking;",

    "- Locations for the storage of building materials and construction debris and contractors' offices;",
    "- Procedures for on-site contractors to deal with complaints from local residents including the name, telephone number and address of a responsible person to whom enquiries/complaints should be directed. These contact details shall also be displayed at regular intervals around the site compound;",
    "- Use of Transport for London's Freight Operator Recognition Scheme (FORS) or similar;",
    "and",
    "- Control measures for dust, noise, vibration, lighting, delivery locations, restriction of hours of work and all associated activities audible beyond the site boundary to 08:00-18:00hrs Mondays to Fridays and 08:00-13:00 hrs on Saturdays - in accordance with the GLA's SPG for The Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition (2014), ILP's Guidance Notes 1 for the Reduction of Obtrusive Light (2020), BS 5228-1:2009+A1:2014, and BS 5228-2:2009+A1:2014 - and the advance notification to neighbours and other interested parties of proposed works.",
    "The development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the approved plan for the duration of the works.",
    "Reason: To ensure appropriate mitigation measures to protect the amenity of local residents and ensure adequate highway and site safety in accordance Condition A.2(1)(a) and Regulation B(18) of Class A of Part 20 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (As Amended).",
    "| All Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) of net power of 37kW and up to and including 560kW used during the course of the demolition, site preparation and construction phases shall comply with the emission standards set out in chapter 7 of the GLA's supplementary planning guidance \"Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition\" dated July 2014 (SPG), or subsequent guidance. Unless it complies with the standards set out in the SPG, no NRMM shall be on site, at any time, whether in use or not, without the prior written consent of the local planning authority. The developer shall keep an up to date list of all NRMM used during the demolition, site preparation and construction phases of the development on the online register at https://nrmm.london/",
    "Reason: To minimise exposure to existing poor air quality, and to protect the air quality for existing residents during the construction process, in accordance with policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021, policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Development Strategy 2026 DPD (2012); and policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
