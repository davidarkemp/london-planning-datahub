Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10.  Details of best practicable mitigation measures for external amenity spaces shall also be provided and implemented, as necessary. Details shall confirm that noise limits specified in BS8233:2014 will not be exceeded. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
