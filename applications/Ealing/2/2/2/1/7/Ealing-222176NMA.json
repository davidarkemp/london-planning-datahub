    "The proposal cannot be accepted as a non-material amendment to planning permission Ref: 213597HH dated 06/07/2021 (as amended by 220047NMA, dated 20/01/2022), in respect S96A of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for Non-Material amendments following a grant of Planning Permission (2011), as it would constitute an increase in the scale of the approved development compromising its design and appearance, particularly when viewed from the street. Both the original approval (213597HH) and the subsequent approved non-material amendment (220047NMA) proposed no changes to the external appearance of the building and therefore planning permission for such a proposal would be required. The proposal would also introduce an inconsistent design feature into the area, being the lightwell and the surrounding fence that would be made of a brick base and metal railing. This would accordingly need to be assessed as part of a planning application as to its appropriateness within its local context and is, overall, considered to be material in nature. The applicant should consider a grille covering the lightwell at natural ground level rather than an elevated fence as part of any future application."
