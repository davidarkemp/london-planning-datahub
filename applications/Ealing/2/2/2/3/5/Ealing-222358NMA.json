    "The proposal cannot be accepted as a non-material amendment to planning permission Ref: 180304FUL dated 28.02.2019, in respect S96A of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for Non-Material amendments following a grant of Planning Permission (2011), as the revised affordable housing offering with Rentplus would require income levels that exceed the maximum income levels for intermediate housing products. Whilst the offer for a gifted deposit of 10% is noted as a differential to the affordable housing offering, the income levels to obtain a mortgage necessary to purchase the property would be prohibitive, with no opportunity to purchase a portion of the property, which is ordinarily allowable under intermediate housing products. Such a change to the affordable housing offering would require the submission of a s73 application and for the financial viability of the development to provide affordable homes to be retested through the submission of a Financial Viability Assessment. The proposal cannot therefore be taken to be a non-material amendment to the scheme."
