    "The owner should use the post construction tab of the GLA's WLC assessment template and this should be completed accurately and in its entirety, in line with the criteria set out in the GLA's WLC Assessment Guidance. The post-construction assessment should provide an update of the information submitted at planning submission stage (RIBA Stage 2/3), including the WLC carbon emission figures for all life-cycle modules based on the actual materials, products and systems used. The assessment for each phase of the development should be submitted along with any supporting evidence as per the guidance and should be received three months post as-built design completion, unless otherwise agreed.",
    "The Development shall implement the measures identified in the WLC Assessment prepared by PRP in May 2022 (v1). Modules A1-A5 should achieve 329 KgCO2e/m2, and B1-C4 (excluding B6/B7) 282 KgCO2e/m2, with a total carbon emissions baseline scenario (over 60 years) of 586 KgCO2e/m2.",
    "Reason: To ensure whole life-cycle carbon is calculated and reduced and to demonstrate compliance with Policy SI2(F) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Circular Economy",
    "Prior to completion of construction of the permitted development a Circular Economy Statement Post Completion Report should be completed accurately for each phase of the development and in its entirety in line with the GLA's Circular Economy Statement Guidance (or equivalent alternative Guidance as may be adopted). This should be submitted to the GLA at: CircularEconomyLPG@london.gov.uk, along with any supporting evidence as per the guidance. The Post Completion Report shall provide updated versions of Tables 1 and 2 of the Circular Economy Statement, the Recycling and Waste Reporting form and Bill of Materials. Confirmation of submission to the GLA shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority, prior to occupation. The specific ambitions detailed in the Revised Circular Economy Statement (Sep. 2022), and any accompanying Logistic Plans, shall be implemented including; diverting 95% of demolition and excavation waste from landfill (and putting to beneficial on-site use), diverting 75% of construction waste from landfill, implementing Clarion's best practice sourcing of 30% recycled construction materials, and diverting the London Plan target of 65% of Operational Waste from landfill by 2030.",
    "Reason: In the interests of sustainable waste management and in order to maximise the appropriate re-use and recycling of materials in line with London Plan (2021) policy SI7.",
