    "| The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing numbers: 001 (Location and block plans); 001 (Existing site photos); 001 002 (Proposed site plan); 110 001 Rev. A (Existing and proposed ground floor plan); 110 002 (Existing and proposed rear elevation and section); 110 003 (Existing east and north elevations); 110 004 (Proposed roof plan and details); 111 001 (Roof repairs); 220 001 (Proposed plans and elevations); Heritage Appraisal (dated May 2022); Design and Access Statement (dated 01.06.22); Roof condition report (dated 01.06.22); Fire strategy (dated 30.05.22); Flood risk assessment (dated 20.05.22) (revision received 23.09.2022),",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interest of proper planning.",
    "| Notwithstanding the details shown on the approved plans, all external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building on this site. The roof must be replaced with an exact like-for-like equivalent, in terms of design, colour, detail and proportion.
