    "The proposal by reason of its design, bulk, scale and visual impact would not appear subordinate to the host dwelling and would be out of keeping with the established character of Hoopers Mews, and would result in detrimental harmful impact to the residential amenity of no.6 Hoopers Mews, in regards to sense of enclosure, overbearing appearance and loss of enjoyment in the use of the roof terrace. As such the proposed development would be contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990; Sections 12 and 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021); Policy D3, D4, D5 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 7.4, 7B & 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
