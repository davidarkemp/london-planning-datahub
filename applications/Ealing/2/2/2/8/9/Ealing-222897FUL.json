    "The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its design, appearance, roof profile, scale and bulk would result in a form of overdevelopment of the subject site which would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous, overbearing, contrived and dominant addition to the building and would be harmful to the visual amenities of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021)."
