    "The proposed ground floor extension would have an excessive depth that would create a large extended wall along the shared boundary with no. 9 Kenilworth Gardens, causing harm to living conditions by reason of loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure. Collectively with the width of the first-floor extension and its poor flat roof design, the proposed extensions to the ground and first floor at the rear, along with the existing roof extension, would cumulatively be an incongruous and discordant form of development that would fail to achieve subordination with the host dwelling, causing harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan, as well as Ealing residential design guidance, including SPD4 (Residential Extensions) and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance. | The proposed front porch extension, by reason of the excessive forward projection of the canopy would disrupt established uniformity in the street scene, and would accordingly be a discordant form of development, that would fail to respect the prevailing pattern of development within the area, causing harm to the visual amenity of the area. The proposal would fail to comply with Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan, as well as Ealing residential design guidance, including SPD4 (Residential Extensions) and Ealing's Housing Design Guidance."
