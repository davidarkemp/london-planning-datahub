    "The proposed roof alteration from hip to gable of the side extension, by reason of its design and poor relationship with the roof design of the original dwelling house, would be an incongruous and discordant form of development that would harm the character and appearance of the host building and the visual amenity of the surrounding area. The proposed roof extension, by reason of its design, size, width, collective volume, bulk and appearance, would constitute an overbearing and over-dominant form of development, that would fail to achieve subordination with the host building, compromising the character and appearance of the host building and the visual amenity of the surrounding area. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), SPD4 (Residential Extensions) and Ealing Council's Housing Design Guidance. | The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its siting, dimensions, design and poor flat roof profile, would constitute an incongruous form of development that would fail to be respectful of the design of the existing building and would likely lead to poor quality living conditions for the occupants of no. 39, including loss of light, outlook and an increased sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the living conditions of existing residents. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), SPD4 (Residential Extensions) and Ealing Council's Housing Design Guidance."
