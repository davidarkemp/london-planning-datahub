    "The development, by reason of its height, depth, design and materials, results in a dominant and intrusive form of development to the detriment of the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The development fails to comply with the NPPF (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), polices 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) and the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Conservation Area Management Plan. | The development is considered to have a detrimental impact on the residential amenity of the neighbouring properties at nos. 3 and 7 Heathcroft due to the height and siting along the shared boundary, resulting in loss of outlook and resulting in an overbearing impact and unneighbourly sense of enclosure contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
