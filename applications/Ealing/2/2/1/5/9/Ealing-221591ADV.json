    "The consent shall expire after 5 years from the date of this notice. | Any advertisements displayed, and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a clean and tidy condition to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. | Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a safe condition. | Where an advertisement is required under these Regulations to be removed, the removal shall be carried out to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. | No advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission. | No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of, any road traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or so as otherwise to render hazardous the use of any highway, waterway (including any coastal waters) or aerodrome (civil or military).",
    "Note: These are imposed automatically unless expressly varied, for instance the time limit shortened. | The minimum duration of each image to be no less than 60 seconds. | The maximum interval between successive advertisements to be less than 1 second. | Successive messages shall be non-sequential, in that they should not contain additional information to the previous message (certainly for non-public information display purposes). | Messages shall not contain phone numbers, email/internet addresses (which would include sites like twitter and facebook) or text numbers (certainly for non-public information display purposes). | Images shall be entirely static and contain no moving images. | Each of the advertisement screens hereby approved shall be fitted with the specified light sensors which shall control the brightness at all times. During the daytime period (between local sunrise and sunset) the brightness of the screens shall be controlled to be no more than 3500 Nitts/sqm. During the night time period (sunset and sunrise) the brightness shall be controlled to be no more than 350 Nitts/sqm. | In the event of a failure the display will default to an output level no higher than that which has been conditioned to be the acceptable maximum under normal operation. If this cannot be achieved, then the display should be required to default to an \"off\" position until the problem can be resolved."
