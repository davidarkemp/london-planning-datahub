As such, the proposal is contrary to National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The combination of the proposed extension by reason of its reason of its scale, height and proximity to the site boundaries would constitute an overdominant and overbearing form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities including loss of light of to 47 Tring Avenue. As such the development would be contrary to policies D3 and D5 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
