Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. The approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

The measures shall ensure that the external rating noise level LAeq emitted will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity. A post installation sound assessment shall be carried out where required to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and additional steps to mitigate noise shall be taken, as necessary.
