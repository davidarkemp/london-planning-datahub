    "The proposed development, by reason of the excessive kitchen facilities and small seating area would indicate a hot food takeaway use, where the site location being approximately 88 metres from Hambrough Primary School and approximately 400 metres from Villiers High school would result in a detrimental impact on creating a healthy food environment and the promotion of healthy eating amongst students. The proposal would therefore be directly contrary to policy E9 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 4C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013)."
