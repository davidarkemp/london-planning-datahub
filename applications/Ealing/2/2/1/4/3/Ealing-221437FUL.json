This storage area shall not be located at the front of the property and these facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed with regard to the Council's standard in the SPG10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. This shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
