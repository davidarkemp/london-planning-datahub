  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal by reason of its design, siting, scale, appearance, orientation and access would represent an inappropriate, ad-hoc and incongruous form of development that is out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development within the area to the detriment of surrounding visual amenity and character and that would set a harmful precedent for future development. As such, it is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposal by way of insufficient provision of internal space and poorly oriented outdoor amenity space would provide substandard accommodation for future occupiers and detrimental impact to the residential amenity of surrounding occupiers by way of loss of privacy, overbearing and overdominance. As such, it is contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D1, D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposals access arrangement to the rear of the site represents an inappropriate form of development that would restrict the access of emergency vehicles causing unsafe conditions for future occupiers of the proposed house. The movement of vehicles passsed the private amenity spaces would also and create unacceptable impacts to residential amenity in terms of noise and emissions to the rear gardens of neaby properties. This is contrary to policies 3.5, 7B of 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D4, D6 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)."
