    "3 \tAny structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a safe condition.",
    "4 \tWhere an advertisement is required under these Regulations to be removed, the removal shall be carried out to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.",
    "5 \tNo advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.",
    "6 \tNo advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to obscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of, any road traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air, or so as otherwise to render hazardous the use of any highway, waterway (including any coastal waters) or aerodrome (civil or military).",
