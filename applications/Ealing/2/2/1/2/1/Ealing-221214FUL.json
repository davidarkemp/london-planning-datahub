    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",

    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | The materials to be used for the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing, unless where stated on either the submitted application form or the drawings / plans as listed in Condition (2).",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 1.1 (g), 2.1 (c) and 2.10 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy 2012. | A minimum of one (1) cycle parking space per unit shall be provided on site in the rear garden area of the building in accordance with adopted standards of the London Plan (2021). Such provision shall be brought into use prior to first occupation and retained permanently.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate facilities for cyclists, in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and National Planning Policy Framework 2021 - section 9. | Prior to the commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority, for the installation in the dwellings of a filtered fresh air ventilation system capable of mitigating elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in the external air. The details to be submitted shall include the arrangements for continuously maintaining the operational efficiency of the system.  The ventilation system as approved shall be completed prior to occupation and shall be retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason: In order to safeguard the amenity of future residents and to meet air quality objectives in accordance with National Planning Policy Framework 2021 - section 12, London Plan policy SI 1, Core Strategy policy 1.1 and 1.2, Development Management Plan policy 7B and Ealing's Climate Change and Ecological Emergency Strategy 2021 - 2030 adopted January 2021. | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed with regards to the Council's standard in the SPG10 and noise limits of BS8233:2014 including aircraft noise - worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57dB).  If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Best practicable mitigation measures shall also be implemented, as necessary, in external amenity spaces to achieve criteria specified in BS8233:2014. The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 - Noise and vibration and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - section 2. | Control measures shall ensure that the following standards are implemented",

    "- notifications of works to interested parties and regular neighbour liaison",
    "- public display of contact details including accessible phone numbers for persons responsible for the site works for the duration of the works in case of emergencies or complaints.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise, vibration, dust, lighting or other emissions from the site, in accordance with accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 Noise and Vibration and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - sections 2 and 12. | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage has been provided on site in accordance with council standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with National Planning Policy Framework (2021) - sections 2 and 12 and London Plan 2021 policies SI7 and SI8. | No part of the flat roof of the ground floor element shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof garden, roof terrace or similar amenity area.",
