    "1.\tThe proposal to increase the width of the first-floor extension to occupy the full width of the original dwelling house, by reason its design, bulk, scale, awkward roof profile and appearance would be an incongruous and discordant form of development that would result in a poorer quality design than what was originally approval of 216171FUL. The applicant is advised that first floor extensions should be limited to 50% of the width of the original dwelling house, to ensure that extensions remain subordinate to their host buildings and do not compromise the character, appearance and visual amenity of the area.",
    "2.\tNotwithstanding the unacceptability of the proposed extensions, the flat created at first floor level would be classed as a 2b4p flat, by virtue that both flats would be double rooms, requiring a minimum internal area of 70sqm. The proposal would not meet this minimum standard at 69.64sqm. It is not considered that this matter could be remedied as the extensions proposed to further facilitate the increased size of the flat would have a poor design outcome."
