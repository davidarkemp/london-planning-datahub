    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building and shall be consistent with those as listed within the submitted application form and the drawings / plans as listed in Condition (2).",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7B, policies 1.1 (h), 1.2 (g) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | Cycle storage for two (2) bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the site (as per the proposed site plan), within a secure, lockable compound in accordance with all adopted standards prior to occupation of the building and be continuously available and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate bicycle storage to align with Sustainable Transport SPG and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage has been provided, as indicated on the drawings / plans as listed in Condition (2), in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D3 and SI8 of the London Plan (2021). | The private garden amenity area shown on the approved plan ref: 473-P-01-01 Rev B shall be laid out and demarcated prior to first occupation the unit hereby permitted and retained in perpetuity thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that there is adequate provision of amenity space within the site in accordance with policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed rooflights hereby approved shall not project more than 150mm from the roof plane and retained as such for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To minimise light spillage and interference with the privacy and outlook of adjoining occupiers and in the interests of good neighbourliness and in accordance with policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 or any Order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification, no extension, enlargement or other alteration of the dwellinghouse other than that expressly authorised by this permission shall be carried out without planning permission first obtained from the local planning authority.",
    "Reason: The local planning authority considers that further development could cause detriment to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby properties or to the character of the area and for this reason would wish to control any future development to comply with section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021). | The sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications shall be assessed with regard to the Council's standard in the SPG10 and noise limits of BS8233:2014. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise). Internal room- and external amenity noise levels shall be mitigated as necessary to achieve noise limits specified in BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/ extraction/ ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 & D14 of The London Plan (2021), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Control measures shall ensure that the following standards are implemented",
