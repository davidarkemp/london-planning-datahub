    "The proposed development by reason of its design, appearance, roof profile, scale and bulk would result in a form of overdevelopment of the subject site which would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous, overbearing, contrived and dominant addition to the building and would be harmful to the visual amenities of the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its depth, height, siting and location would cause unacceptable harm to residential amenity of no. 33 Brassie Avenue, by reason of being overdominant resulting in a loss of light, outlook, and cause a sense of enclosure and overbearing towards the occupiers of this property. As such, it is considered the proposed rear extension would be contrary to Section 12 the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 (g) and (h) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B of the adopted Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013)."
