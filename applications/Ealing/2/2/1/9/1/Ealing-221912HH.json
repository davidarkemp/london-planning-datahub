    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting, design and relationship with its context would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. This would become one of the largest outbuildings in the area and would unduly draw the eye. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proportions of the building and having a GIA of approximately 37m2 raises the notion that this would not be for the enjoyment of the main house and could reasonably be utilized an independent unit of accommodation. A new dwelling in this location would be harmfully out of keeping and would be contrary to the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
