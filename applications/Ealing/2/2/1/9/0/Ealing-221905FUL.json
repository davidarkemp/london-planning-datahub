    "The proposal by reason of its excessive crossover width that exceeds the maximum allowable of 2.4 metres, would fail to comply with the requirements outlined within the document \"Dropped Kerbs - Application Pack for Residents\", that could have an unreasonable impact on highway and pedestrian safety as well as the availability of on-street parking. It is also advised that the two posts that have been erected to the front boundary would likely exceed the maximum allowable height of 1 metre. This has not formed part of this application and is currently unlawful. Planning permission would be required for this and there is little prospect of such a proposal being approved. The applicant is therefore advised to reduce the height of these posts and submit as part of a revised application existing and proposed elevation plans. The proposal accordingly fails to comply with Council's Highway Services Requirements, as well as Policy T4 of the London Plan."
