    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B; London Plan (2021) policy D3; and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The cycle storage shown on approved plans shall provide a minimum of 8 cycle parking spaces in a secure, covered facility in accordance with policy and be brought into use prior to the first occupation of the development permitted and retained permanently thereafter.",
    "Reason: To promote sustainable patterns of transport, in accordance with Section 9 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development shall be provided with refuse storage as shown on approved plan P013 (received 29.06.2022) to accord with the local planning authority standards prior to first occupation.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the adequate disposal, storage and collection of waste and recycling, to protect the living conditions of occupiers of the area and in the interests of highway and pedestrian safety all in accordance with policies 1.1 (e) and 6.1 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A  of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy SI7 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | Prior to commencement of the development, a noise assessment shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of external noise levels from transport and industrial/ commercial/ cultural sources, having regard to the assessment standards of the Council's SPG10 including aircraft noise (worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57dB) as per Section 6 SPG10). Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10.  Details of best practicable mitigation measures for external amenity spaces shall also be provided and implemented, as necessary. Details shall confirm that noise limits specified in BS8233:2014 will not be exceeded. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",

    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'. | Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of enhanced sound insulation of lifts and lift shafts, in accordance with noise limits specified in Table 5 BS8233:2014. Where noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level shall not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins inside a habitable room. Details shall include mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound/rating level.
