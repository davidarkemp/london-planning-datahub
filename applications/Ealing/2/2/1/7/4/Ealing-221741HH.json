    "The proposed development, by virtue of its height and siting and relationship with its context would be out of character and harmful to the established pattern of development in the area. The proposed height of approximately 4.2m would unduly draw the eye and would be a harmful and incongruous feature within the street scene. The proposed door to the rear of the outbuilding could also allow access to the structure, meaning it would no longer be for the enjoyment of the main house. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the design objectives of Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
