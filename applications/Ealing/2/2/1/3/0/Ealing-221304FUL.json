    "(b) Within three months of first use of the development hereby approved, a report contain-ing the following details shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authori-ty:",
    "o Results of each site visit by the lead arboriculturist with photos attached.",
    "o Assessment of the retained and planted trees including any necessary remedial action as a result of damage incurred during construction.",
    "Reason: To ensure appropriate tree protection in the interests of protecting the visual amenity of the area, contributing to the quality and character of London's environment, air quality and adapting to and mitigating climate change in accordance with policies 5.10 and 7.21 of the London Plan, policy 5.10 of Ealing's Development Management DPD and Ea-ling's SPG 9 - Trees and Development Guidelines. | No trees, shrubs or hedges within the site which are shown to be retained on the approved plans shall be felled, uprooted, damaged or destroyed, cut back in any way or removed without previous written consent of the Local Planning Authority. Any shrubs or hedges removed without consent or dying or being severely damaged or becoming serious-ly diseased within 5 years from the completion of the development hereby permitted shall be replaced with shrubs or hedge plants or similar species capable of achieving a compa-rable size unless the Local Planning Authority gives written consent to any variation.",
    "If a tree marked on the tree report to be retained is removed without consent, or dying, or being severely damaged, or becoming seriously diseased (crown more than 50% sparse), within 5 years from the start of work on the development hereby permitted, a replacement tree shall be planted on the site or surrounding area reflecting the CAVAT value of the tree, or a proportion of its value reflecting the damage. This penalty shall be sought, unless the Local Planning Authority has given written consent to any variation.",
    "Reason: to secure the protection throughout the time that development is being carried out, of trees, shrubs and hedges growing within the site which are of important amenity value to the local landscape."
