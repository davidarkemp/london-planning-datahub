    "The proposed development by reason of its design, appearance and scale would constitute an incongruous, un-neighbourly and unsympathetic form of development to the detriment of the appearance of the dwellinghouse and the visual amenity and character of the street scene. As such, the proposal is contrary with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021) Chapter 12, the London Plan (2021) policy D4, and the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) policies 7.4 and 7B. | The proposed development due to its design, scale and siting would result in adverse residential impacts by way of loss of light, outlook or increased feeling of enclosure upon the amenity of the adjoining neighbouring residents No. 227 Windmill Road therefore it is considered that the proposal is contrary with policies D3, D4 and of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 of the Adopted Ealing Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012)."
