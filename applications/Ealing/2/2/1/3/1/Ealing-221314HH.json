    "The proposed development by reason of the cumulative impact of the proposed extensions; its design, bulk, siting, width, unsympathetic design and roof profile, would be an incongruous form of development that would fail to be subordinate to the host dwelling or consistent with the prevailing pattern of development, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the objectives of policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and National Planning Policy Framework (2019). | The proposed extension by reason of its design, scale, bulk and siting would result in an unneighbourly form of development to the detriment of the residential amenity of No. 28 Willow Road, by way of being overbearing, resulting in an increased sense of enclosure and loss of light contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
