    "The proposed two storey rear extension by reason of its excessive depth on both levels and excessive width on first floor level, constituting an overly dominant form of development that would fail to relate sympathetically and subordinately to the main dwelling resulting in harm to the character of the host dwelling and conservation area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D4 and D5 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Northolt Village Green Conservation Area Management Plan (2008) and National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposed first floor rear extension by reason of its excessive depth and proximity to the site boundaries would constitute an overdominant and overbearing form of development to the detriment of the residential amenities of the adjoining properties.
