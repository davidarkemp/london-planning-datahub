    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting and the height of the proposed wall and extension would give rise to a harmful sense of enclosure to the garden of number 1 Laurel Gardens. As such, the proposal is contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed amenity space for both flats would be of limited proportion and would be compromised by items such as the siting and being adjacent the car park, the heights of the adjacent walls and the access to the flats and the bin store. This would not provide a good or usable space for both flats and would cause harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers. This would therefore be contrary to Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013."
