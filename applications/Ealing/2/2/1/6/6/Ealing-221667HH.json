As such, the proposal would fail to comply with the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area Management Plan (2008),) and Policies D1, D2, D3 and D4 and HC1 of the Publication London Plan (2022), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Adopted Development Management Plan (2013) and policy 1.1 of the Adopted Ealing Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012)."
