    "The projection to the side by reason of its location, design, width, depth, mass, bulk, and height, results in a contrived overdevelopment of the site. It is a dominant and incongruous feature within the established street scene of the area. The development adversely harms the visual amenities of the established street scene and is out of keeping and at odds with the general character and pattern of development of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 7.4 and 7B of Ealing's Development Management DPD 2013. | There is a lack of information on the submitted plans with regards the actual use of the extension. The submitted plans confirm that this space would be a kitchen but that there is no internal access into the main part of the house. This raises the notion that this space may not be for the enjoyment of the main house. It is therefore not possible to accurately confirm the impact the proposed development would have upon items such as the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. It would also not be possible to accurately confirm the impact upon the living conditions of the adjacent occupiers. The development is therefore considered contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013."
