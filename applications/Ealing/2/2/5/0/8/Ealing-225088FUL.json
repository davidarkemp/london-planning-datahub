    "The proposed ground floor extension, by reason of its scale, bulk, dimensions, and excessive site coverage, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development. In addition, the proposed roof extension, by reason of its design, and appearance would result in a poor design outcome against the prevailing pattern of development and cause disruption to the uniformity of the rear roofscape of the terrace. This design of the proposals would therefore be to the detriment of the character, appearance and visual amenity of the Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the NPPF (2021), policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7B, LV7.4 and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).\t | The proposed Flat 2, by reason of its insufficient internal space, would constitute a substandard form of residential accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. In addition, Flat 3, by reason of its small bathroom size and low floor-to-ceiling height, would result in cramped and poor living conditions for future residents. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with policy LV3.5 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Technical housing standards - nationally described space standard (2015) as well as policy D6 of the London Plan (2021). | The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale and extent of development within this plot, would constitute an overbearing and unneighbourly form of development, to the detriment of the visual amenity of occupiers of no.40 St Mary Road. As such, it is contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B  of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). | The proposed cycle storage, by reason of its cramped layout and dimensions, would fail to provide adequate space for the intended number of cycle parking spaces, rendering a portion of these unusable. The proposed cycle parking spaces would therefore not be fit for purpose and would not encourage a modal shift to sustainable forms of transportation. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan."
