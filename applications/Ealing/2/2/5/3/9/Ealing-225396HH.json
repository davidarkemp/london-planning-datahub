    "The proposed first floor rear extensions, by reason of its excessive depth, would constitute overdevelopment of the application site, create an overbearing addition to the host dwelling, which would be at odds with the proportions of the host dwelling and cause harm to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The excessive depth of the extension would also result in harmful living conditions to the occupants of 15 North Common Road due to an increased loss of daylight and sunlight. Accordingly, the proposal would fail to comply with NPPF (2021), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the Ealing Common Conservation Area Management Plan. policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
