    "The proposed development, by reason its scale, roof design and lack of subordination, would result in an incongruous addition to the host dwelling, which over-dominates and is unsympathetic to the dwelling's original scale and character, to detriment of the appearance of the host dwelling and the character, appearance, and significance of the Cuckoo Estate Conservation Area. The proposal would lead to less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the CA. There would be no public benefit arising from the proposal to outweigh the harm identified. As such, the proposal is contrary to Paragraphs 199 and 202 of the NPPF (2021), Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), the Cuckoo Estate Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Plan (2007)."
