    "The proposed rear extension, by virtue of its height and width spanning across whole rear elevations of the host dwelling and side extensions, would constitute an overbearing form of addition which fails to remain subordinate to the main dwelling or respond to the established rear building line in the area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to objectives of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing DPD 2013. | The proposed Flat 5, by virtue of failure to provide at least 75% GIA with a minimum ceiling height of 2.3m, would result in poor living condition to the detriment of the wellbeing of future occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to technical housing standards - nationally described space standard 2015, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing DPD 2013. | The cumulative impact of:",
    "-\tExcessive rear extensions,",
    "-\tNo private amenity spaces for Flat 3, 4 and 5, insufficient ceiling height for Flat 5, no furniture plans for living rooms of all flats,",
