    "The proposed development by reason of scale, massing, cumulative impact and its proximity to site boundaries, would result in a form of unneighbourly and overbearing development that would have an increased loss of light and sense of enclosure upon no. 31 Shaftesbury Avenue. As such, the proposal is contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013). | The proposed first floor rear extension due to its overall scale, design, bulk, massing and prominence would fail to appear subordinate to the host building and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition that would be harmful to the character of the building and visual amenities of the area.  As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021)."
