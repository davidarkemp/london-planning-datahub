    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of an odour risk assessment (according to 2018 EMAQ Guidance) and of odour abatement equipment and extract system, including operational details and maintenance schedule, the height of the extract duct, with vertical discharge outlet, without cowl, at least 1m above the eaves of the main building and above openable windows. Details shall be provided of a reasonable distance of the extract outlet approximately 20.0 meters from any openable window unless effective odour control is installed. Approved details shall be implemented prior to use and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site and surrounding premises is not adversely affected by smell or steam, in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D6, D14 and SI 1of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
    "| Prior to the commencement of the development, details of the external rating noise level emitted from plant/ machinery/ equipment/ducting/air in- and outlets/mechanical installations, together with mitigation measures as appropriate, shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The measures shall ensure that the external rating noise level LAeq emitted will be lower than the lowest existing background sound level LA90 by 10dBA at the most noise sensitive receiver locations at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all plant/equipment operating together at maximum capacity. Where required, a post installation sound assessment shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The assessment shall be carried out to confirm compliance with the noise criteria and shall include additional steps to mitigate noise as necessary.  Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation/ use of plant/ machinery/ equipment and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site and surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations or equipment, in accordance with Policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",

Where noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level should not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins (octaves) inside a habitable room. Details shall include the installation method and materials of separating structures and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound level. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the residential occupiers, in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021).",
