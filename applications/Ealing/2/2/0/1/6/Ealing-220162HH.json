    "The proposed extension, by reason of its dimensions, depth, height, excessive site coverage and loss of usable garden area, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, that would be against the prevailing pattern of development, causing demonstrable harm to the character and appearance of the terrace row and visual amenity of the area. The proposal would accordingly be contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan and Policies 7B, LV7.4 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD. | The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height, scale, site coverage and projection along the boundary with constrained existing garden spaces of adjoining properties, would constitute an oppressive form of overdevelopment, that would result in an undue sense of enclosure and loss of light to neighbouring properties. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan and Policies 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
