    "The development to which this consent relates must be begun not later than the expiration of three years beginning with the date on which the consent is granted.",
    "Reason: To comply with the provisions of Section 18(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, as amended, to prevent the accumulation of unimplemented listed building consents and to enable the Local Planning Authority to review the situation at the end of this period if the development has not begun.",
    "| The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title number(s): 1067 (Location Plan); 1067/01 (Site Block Plan); 1067/10 (Existing Outbuilding Plans); 1067/11 (Existing Outbuilding Elevations); 1067/12-B (Proposed Outbuilding Plans); 1067/13-A (Proposed Outbuilding Elevations); 1067-15 (Joinery Details); Design and Access Statement incorporating Heritage Statement prepared by West Scott Architects dated January 2022",

No cooking or kitchen facilities shall be installed into the outbuilding at any time.",
    "REASON: To prevent the creation of a separate self-contained residential unit of accommodation in the interests of the living conditions of the existing and future residents of the site and to ensure that the building does not, by reason of any other activity, harm the living conditions in the area, in accordance with policies 1.1, 1.2, and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), SPG 4, policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021)",
    "| The hereby approved rooflight to the north side roof slope of the outbuilding shall be a Conservation style rooflight and lie flush with the roof and shall be retained as such for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, and to safeguard the character and appearance of the conservation area in accordance with policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
