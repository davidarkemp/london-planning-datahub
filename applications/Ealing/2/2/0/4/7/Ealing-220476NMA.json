    "The proposed changes would introduce items such as a new terrace to the upper floor flat. There are also no elevations and no details concerning the other proposed amendments such as the changes in materials and introduction of gas boxes. The internal changes with regards Flat 3 would also cause a harm to the living conditions of the future occupiers in terms of inadequate GIA. These amendments would materially alter the previous planning permission. They cannot be treated as a non-material amendment to planning permission Ref. Planning 202014FUL dated 20.10.2020 and would be contrary to Section 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) and the Ealing Protocol for Non-Material Amendments Following a Grant of Planning Permission (2011)."
