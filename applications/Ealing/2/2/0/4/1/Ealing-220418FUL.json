    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "| The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing title number(s):",
    "Drawing number E.1 - Existing site plan, Drawing number E.2 - Existing ground floor plan, Drawing number E.3 - Existing first floor plan, Drawing number E.4 - Existing front elevation, Drawing number E.5 - Existing side elevation, Drawing number E.6 - Existing rear elevation, Drawing number E.7 - Existing section, Drawing number P.1 (revised) - Proposed site plan, Drawing number P.2 (revised) - Proposed ground floor plan, Drawing number P.3 (revised) - Proposed first floor plan, Drawing number P.4 (revised) - Proposed second floor plan, Drawing number P.5 (revised) - Proposed front elevation, Drawing number P.6 (revised) - Proposed side elevation, Drawing number P.7 - Proposed rear elevation, Drawing number P.8 - Proposed section, Drawing number P.9 (revised) - Proposed section",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt, and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building/ the surrounding dwellings adjacent the site (number 19 and 23 Erlesmere Gardens) and shall be consistent with those as listed within the submitted application form and the drawings / plans as listed in  Condition (2).",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings in accordance with the Council's adopted Ealing Development Management DPD  (2013) policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7B, policies 1.1 (h), 1.2 (g) and 2.10 of the adopted Local Development Framework (Core Strategy 2012) and policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Cycle storage for two (2) bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the site, within a secure, lockable compound in accordance with all adopted standards prior to occupation of the building and be continuously available and retained for the life of the development hereby approved.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate bicycle storage to align with Sustainable Transport SPG and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within an enclosure has been provided within the front garden of the property, in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012) policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D3 and SI8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| No part of the proposed flat roofs shall be used as or altered to form a balcony, roof terrace/garden or similar amenity area.",
    "Reason: To protect the living conditions of occupants of nearby properties and future occupiers of the development, in accordance with policies 7A ,7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management Plan (2013) and policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Notwithstanding the provisions of Classes A, B, C, D and E of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (as amended), no extensions or works as specified in the stated classed shall be carried out without the prior permission of the Local Planning Authority, obtained through the submission of a planning application.",
    "Reason: The local planning authority considers that further development could cause detriment to the amenities of the occupiers of nearby properties or to the character of the area and for this reason would wish to control any future development to comply with section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "| The site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57dB). The sound insulation of the building envelope shall achieve the internal criteria for sensitive rooms, as specified in Section 6 Supplementary Planning Guidance 10. If compliance requires the windows to be closed, then acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling shall be installed as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building).  The above shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policy 7.15 of The London Plan (2015), Ealing SPG10 and the National Planning Policy Framework (2019)."
