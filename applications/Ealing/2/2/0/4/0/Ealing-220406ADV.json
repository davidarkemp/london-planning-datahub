    "The proposed signage by reason of its scale, siting, design and appearance would constitute an overbearing and incongruous advertisement to the detriment of the amenity and historic character of the surrounding area and the adjacent Grade II listed bridge. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to policy D4, HC1 and HC3 of the London Plan (2016) and 7A, 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed advertisement by reason of its placement, digital display, proximity to a junction, size and scale, would constitute an undue distraction to road users, and would adversely affect the safety of the transport network. As such, the proposal is considered contrary to policies T3 and T4 of the London Plan (2021)."
