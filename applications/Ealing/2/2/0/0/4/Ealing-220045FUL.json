    "The proposed design with regards the excessive depth as well as the height of the eaves and roof juncture between number 163A and 165 Boston Road would be readily visible from the road and public space. They are not respectful to one another and would unduly draw the eye. The proposed development would be an overdevelopment of the plot and would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. As such, it would be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework, Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy and policies 7.4 and 7B Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013.",
    "| The proposed development, by reason of inadequate GIA as well as the siting of the proposed windows and front door, including only having a rooflight to one room would provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers. There would also be a harmful loss of privacy to the future occupiers. This would be contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). It would also be contrary to the Technical Housing Standards. | The proposed development would purely provide studio and one bedroom flats. It would also not provide any larger properties. As there is not an adequate mixture of units or the provision of larger units, the proposed development would be contrary to Policy H10 of the London Plan as well as Ealing's Strategic Housing Market Assessment. | The siting, depth and height of the replacement building would harmfully enclose adjacent openings. It would lead to a loss of outlook to the openings to the rear of number 165 and could impact upon the light entering the openings to the side of 163 Boston Road. It would therefore cause significant harm to the living conditions of the adjacent properties and would be contrary to section 7 of the National Planning Policy Framework, policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013, policy 1.1 (g) of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy 2012 and policy D6 of the London Plan (2021). | The existing commercial unit is currently empty and appears to be in need to repair but if this were carried out, it could be readily occupied. As the unit is within a primary shopping frontage and as the loss of this commercial space has not been sufficiently justified/ shown that it is no longer viable, it would cause significant harm in terms of employment opportunities and upon the economy. The development is therefore contrary to planning policies such as Policy 4A Ealing Development Management Development Plan 2013 - Employment Uses as well as Policy CG5 of the London Plan 2021."
