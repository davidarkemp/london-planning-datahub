  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed residential flats, by reason of their inadequate internal space provision, lack of private or communal amenity space, lack of built-in internal storage, lack of adequate refuse storage and lack of cycle parking, would constitute a substandard form of development, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents and would fail to encourage a modal shift to more sustainable forms of transportation. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D6 and T5 of the London Plan, Policy LV3.5 and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD and the Technical Housing Standards and Mayor's Housing SPG. | The proposed first floor extension, by reason of its projection, roof profile, inaccurate elevation plans, and proximity to areas of public view, would be a discordant form of development, that would cause imbalance to the two-storey outrigger and cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan and Policies LV7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD."
