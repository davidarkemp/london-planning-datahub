  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed two storey rear extension by reason of its design, scale, bulk and massing would constitute an incongruous overdevelopment that would fail to appear subordinate to the original dwelling and would be out of character with the prevailing pattern of development in the conservation area and as such would constitute an inappropriate form of development, and therefore be contrary to the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4, 7B and 7C Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013) and policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Adopted Development (Core) Strategy (2012). | The proposed development, by reason of its depth, scale, height and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring property at No.18-19 Hanger Lane. The proposed development would appear over dominant and overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties, and would result in an unacceptable loss of light and outlook, creating an undesirable sense of enclosure to those properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023). | The proposed HMO development, by reason of its poor layout, inadequate provision of natural light to the basement bedrooms, and inadequate kitchen facility provision, would constitute a substandard form of residential accommodation, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), the Technical Housing Standards, Council's HMO Licensing requirements and the Mayor's Housing SPG."
