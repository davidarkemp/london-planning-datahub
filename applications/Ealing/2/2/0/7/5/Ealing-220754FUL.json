    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| A filtered fresh air ventilation system capable of mitigating elevated concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in the external air shall be installed within the proposed flats, that is the same as other arrangements within the building. This system shall be continuously maintained to ensure the operational efficiency of the system. This fresh air ventilation system shall be installed prior to any occupation of the proposed flats and shall be retained, and in good working order for the lifetime of the development.",
    "Reason: To minimise exposure to existing poor air quality, and provide a suitable internal living environment for future occupiers, in accordance with policy SI 1 of the London Plan 2021, policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Development Strategy 2026 DPD (2012); and policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | Prior to occupation of the proposed flats, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of enhanced sound insulation of at least 10/15/20 dB (as necessary) above the Building Regulations value for residential use, as necessary, of the floor/ceiling/walls separating the commercial areas and mechanical installations from dwellings. Where noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level shall not exceed NR20 Leq 5mins (octaves) inside habitable rooms. Details of mitigation measures shall include the installation method, materials of separating structures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound/rating level. The assessment and mitigation measures shall be based on standards and noise limits of the Council's SPG10 and BS8233:2014. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the residential occupiers, in accordance with policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD.",
    "| The individual and combined external sound level emitted from plant, machinery or equipment at the development site shall be lower than the lowest existing background sound level by at least 10dBA, as measured at/ calculated to the nearest and most affected noise sensitive premises at the development site and at surrounding premises. The assessment shall be made in accordance with BS4142:2014 +A1 2019, with all machinery operating together at maximum capacity.",
    "Reason:   To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/ surrounding premises is not adversely affected by noise from mechanical installations/ equipment, in accordance with Policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan and Policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management DPD.",
