    "The proposed use, by reason of the introduction of a fast food takeaway in this location, would further add to the proliferation of hot food takeaways within 150m walking distance of a school entrance, contributing to the proliferation of unhealthy food options along the shopping parade; would create an unhealthy food environment to the detriment of the promotion of healthy eating amongst students; and would contribute to the overconcentration of a particular use type that would erode local amenity by nature of its concentration. The proposal would therefore run contrary to policy E9 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 4C of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan (2013). | The proposed external flue duct to the rear elevation, by reason of its location, arrangement, position of its outlet and insufficient information regarding odour and noise control, would be in immediate proximity of residential balconies and windows and would result in the erosion of the amenities of surrounding uses and would fail to take all reasonable steps to ameliorate these emissions to the detriment of the occupiers of the upper floor flats of 500, 502 and 504 Lady Margaret Road. The proposal therefore runs contrary to policies D4, D6, D14 and SI 1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 1.1 and 2.10 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'."
