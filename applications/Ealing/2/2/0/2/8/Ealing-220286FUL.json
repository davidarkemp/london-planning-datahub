    "The proposed building/hotel extension, by reason of its height, bulk, massing, scale, site coverage and forward projection to Creffield Road, would constitute an incongruous, discordant and cramped form of development, that would fail to give regard to the prevailing pattern of development, resulting in harm to the visual amenity of the street scene and the character, appearance and visual openness of the Conservation Area. The height of the building, as well as the location of windows within the north-western elevation, would also result in a loss of light and direct overlooking and loss of privacy to the adjoining property to the north-west (10 Hanger Lane). As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policies D1, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan, Policies LV7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD, the Ealing Common Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan and the NPPF."
