  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by reason of its design, siting and height would be overbearing and would represent an incongruous and obtrusive overdevelopment, adversely affecting the architectural integrity of the original dwelling, the visual amenity of the street scene and the character of the area. The first-floor rear extension would have a detrimental affect upon the neighbours as it would create a sense of enclosure and create a loss of light upon the adjoining and immediate neighbours. Taking the above into account, it is considered that the proposed first-floor extension would impact the character and appearance of the local area, and is contrary with policies D1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
