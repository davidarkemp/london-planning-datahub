    "The proposed second and third floor outrigger extension by reason of its design and scale would represent an insubordinate and overbearing addition to the host building which would be detrimental to the character of the Ealing Town Centre Conservation Area. It therefore runs contrary to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3, D4, D6 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, 7.4 and 7C of the Ealing Development Management Plan, and the Ealing Town Centre Conservation Area Management Plan (2007) | The proposed second and third floor rear extension, by reason of its depth and siting, would result in a form of unneighbourly development that would lead to a loss of light, sense of enclosure, and loss of outlook to the third floor residential unit at no. 16 The Mall. As such, the amenity values currently enjoyed at this neighbouring property would be unduly and unacceptably impacted upon by the proposal. As such, the proposal would be contrary to section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021); policies 1.1 of Ealing's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012); and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013)."
