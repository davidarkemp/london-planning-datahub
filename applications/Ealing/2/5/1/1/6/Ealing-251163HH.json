    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, bulk, relationship with the existing and neighbouring extensions, and lack of details, would harm the design integrity of the host building and character of the Conservation Area. The harm is not considered to be outweighed by any public benefits. As such, the proposal is contrary to paragraph 215 of the NPPF 2024, policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan and policies 7.4, 7B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013."
