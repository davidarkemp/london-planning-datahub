    "The proposed rear roof extension and hip to gable alteration by way of its height and change in roof form would result in an adverse cumulative impact, disrupting the orderly pattern of building heights within Palm Grove. The proposed height of the rear roof extension would extend higher than the original roof ridge, creating an appearance of overt mass and bulk which would unbalance the semi-detached pair and would constitute a discordant form of development.",
    "As such, the proposal is considered to be unacceptable in terms of its design and would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
