    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its height, bulk, depth, design and scale would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that is detrimental to the characters of the original building and the conservation area and would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of conservation area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with would be contrary to the NPPF (2024), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and the Ealing Common Conservation Area Management Plan."
