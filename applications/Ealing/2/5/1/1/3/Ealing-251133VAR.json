    "The proposed hipped roof over two storey side extension, by reason of its height, depth, design and scale would constitute an incongruous and illogical addition to the building and local area that would fail to appear subservient to the original house and would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
