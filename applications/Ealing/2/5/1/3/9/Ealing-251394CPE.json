    "The submitted evidence as required under Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) does not sufficiently demonstrate, on the balance of probability, that the dwelling has been in continuous use as a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) comprising a maximum of 6 residents for a continuous period greater than 4 years prior to the application being submitted. It also does not demonstrate that the property could have been lawfully converted to an HMO under permitted development rights. It is therefore recommended that a Lawful Development Certificate not be granted."
