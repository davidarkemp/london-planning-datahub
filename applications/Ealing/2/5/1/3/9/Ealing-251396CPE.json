    "The submitted evidence as required under Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by section 10 of the Planning & Compensation Act 1991), demonstrates, on the balance of probability, that the outbuilding has been in use as builders storage for a period greater than 4 years prior to the application being submitted. It is therefore recommended that a Lawful Development Certificate be granted."
