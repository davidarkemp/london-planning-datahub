    "The proposal, by reasons of its siting and proximity to the side boundary as well as the removal of the existing windows of the host building at No. 33 Hazeltree Lane, would result in loss of outlook, increased sense of enclosure and overshadowing to the rear garden of the host building, to the detrimental of the residential amenity of occupants of the host building, failing to comply with the objectives of the policies D6 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing Housing Desing Guidance (2022). | The proposed two-storey dwellinghouse, by reason of its siting and roof design, would be out of keeping with the character and spatial pattern of development in the housing estate, failing to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing Housing Desing Guidance (2022). | The proposed development, by reason of inadequate GIA as well as undersized private garden space would provide substandard accommodation to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers contrary to policies 3.5, 7B and 7D of the Development Management DPD (2013), policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Housing Design Standards LPG (2023). | The proposal by reasons of its lack of sustainability / energy assessment and Biodiversity Net Gain assessment, would fail to demonstrate that the proposed development would be a sustainable development and have at least 10% biodiversity net gain, failing to comply with London Plan Policy SI2, Ealing Development Management DPD Policy 5.2 and Policy G6 of the Ealing's draft Local Plan (2024)."
