    "The proposed development, by reason of its bulk, massing, scale, and design, would appear as an incongruous and dominant addition that fails to respect the original form and character of the host property. The omission of the chimney and the lack of glazing bars to the left-sided window panels of the front bay windows would also be inappropriate. There would be harm to the character and appearance of the Northolt Village Green Conservation Area. As such, it would be contrary to Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7.B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of the Ealing Draft Local Plan (Regulation 22), and the Ealing Generic Conservation Area Management Plan (2023)."
