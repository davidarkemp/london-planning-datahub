    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.",
    "| All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "| Cycle storage for ^IN;  bicycle spaces shall be provided within the curtilage of the development, within secure, lockable compounds in accordance with the designated locations identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and all adopted standards prior to the first occupation of the building. The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason:  To provide adequate bicycle storage in accordance with policy and T5 of the London Plan (2021). | The development hereby approved shall not be occupied until refuse and recycling storage within a secure enclosure has been provided in accordance with the designated location identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and in accordance with the Local Planning Authority Standards and has been fully implemented and made available for use. These facilities shall permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 8 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "| Aircraft Noise",
    "The site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (60 dB) (See Appendix 5 SPG10). Before the development is commenced, a desk top study shall be submitted for approval by the Council in writing, for the sound insulation of the building envelope, based on the aircraft noise contour spectrum specified in Section 6 Supplementary Planning Guidance 10, and which will achieve the internal criteria for noise sensitive rooms. The details should also include the provision of alternative means of acoustically attenuated ventilation and cooling, as necessary, (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise), in accordance with the Council's criteria. The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site is not adversely affected by noise in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) and Ealing SPG10",

    "Prior to commencement of the development, details shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of enhanced sound insulation values of at least 5dB above the ADE Building Regulations values, for the floor/ceiling/wall structures separating different types of rooms/uses in adjoining dwellings/areas, namely, bedroom below kitchen/dining room of separate dwelling. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
