    "The proposed development, together with the existing roof extensions, given their combined scale, bulk and flat roof form, would constitute an overbearing and out of keeping addition to the detriment of the design integrity of the host building and character of the area.  In addition, the inconsistent drawings did not provide sufficient information for the Council to make an accurate and fair judgement of the design. As such, it is contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013. | The proposed first floor extension, given its depth, height and elevated position along the boundary, would result in unacceptable sense of enclosure and overshadowing of the neighbouring garden at no. 15 Downside Crescent. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
