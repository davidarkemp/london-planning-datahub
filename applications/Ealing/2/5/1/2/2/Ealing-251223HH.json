    "The proposed development by reason of its inappropriate design would constitute in an out-of-keeping and incongruous development harming the character and appearance of the conservation area. The development would therefore fail to comply with the NPPF (2025), policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7C and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and the Brunswick Conservation Area Management Plan (2007). | The proposal would result in an inadequate and excessive wide crossover/dropped kerb that would be contrary to the standards of the Ealing's Council Guidance Vehicle crossovers - application pack for residents (2016), and policies T3 and T4 of the London Plan 2021 and adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (April 2012), as well as the National Planning Policy Framework (2025)."
