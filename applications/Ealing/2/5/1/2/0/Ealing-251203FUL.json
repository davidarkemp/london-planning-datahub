    "By way of its design, scale and siting, the proposed construction of a two-storey dwellinghouse to rear (following demolition of existing outbuilding) would constitute an overdevelopment of the site, enclosing the street scene of Junction Road to the detriment of the character of the area. As such the proposal would be contrary to policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | By way of its depth, height, siting and subsequent cumulative development to the application site, the proposed two-storey dwellinghouse would cause an unreasonable sense of enclosure for the outlook of no.64 Carlyle Road and would adversely impact its residential amenity by diminishing its openness. As such, it is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its impacts on neighbouring amenity and would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | By way of it siting and design, the proposed two-storey dwelling would have inadequate natural ventilation and/or outlook, noting the dwelling would not meet the definition of a dual aspect dwelling and have suboptimal privacy from the street. Combined with the lack of outdoor amenity space, the proposal would fail to meet Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021)."
