    "Reason: To ensure adequate refuse storage in accordance with Policy SI 7 of the London Plan (2021). | Prior to commencement of the development, a noise assessment shall be submitted to the Council for approval in writing, of external noise levels from commercial/ industrial/ cultural/transport sources, incl. activities associated with the surrounding commercial premises and markets, and reflected and re-radiated noise where appropriate, occurring at the site during most of the year, ie. measured during school and work weekdays.",
    "Details shall include the sound insulation of the building envelope including glazing specifications (laboratory tested including frames, seals and any integral ventilators, approved in accordance with BS EN ISO 10140-2:2010) and of acoustically attenuated mechanical ventilation and cooling as necessary (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and details of self-noise) to achieve internal noise limits specified in SPG10.",

Where commercial noise emissions include characteristic features, the Noise Rating level shall not exceed NR20 Leq (5mins) inside habitable rooms. Details shall include the installation method and materials of separating structures and, where necessary, additional mitigation measures and the resulting sound insulation value and internal sound levels. Approved details shall be implemented prior to occupation of the development and thereafter be permanently retained.",
