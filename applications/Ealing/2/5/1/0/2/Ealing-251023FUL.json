As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies H9, D1, D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024). | The proposed development, by reason of missing of its height, design, scale and proximity to neighbouring boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would result in creation of loss of privacy to the neighbouring properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
