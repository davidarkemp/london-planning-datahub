    "The proposed development would fail to provide acceptable living conditions. The proposal would provide undersized residential unit for Flat 2, failing to comply with the minimum gross internal area outlined in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021. The internal space would not provide an acceptable standard of accommodation.",
    "As such, the proposed residential accommodation would provide for unsatisfactory living conditions for future residents, to the detriment of the living conditions of future residents. The proposal fails to comply with the requirements of Policy D6 of the London Plan, Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Mayor's Housing Design Standards LPG (2023) and the Technical Housing Standards. | By way of its size, the proposed development would fail to provide internal or external amenity space for Flat 2. The proposed Kitchen, Living and Dining Room are undersized and would fail to meet the minimum space standards for the Mayor's Housing Design Standards LPG  (2023).",
    "As such, the proposed development would provide insufficient amenity space for Flat 2, failing to provide high quality housing with adequately sized rooms. Therefore the proposed development fails to comply with The Mayor's Housing Design Standards LPG June 2023, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD.",
    "| The proposed bin store, by way of its location and positioning, would have an adverse impact on the residential amenity of the proposed Ground Floor Flat as accessing the bin store in its proposed location would result in a loss of privacy and sense of overlooking into the ground floor front bedroom window. The positioning of the refuse store would also likely result in poor living conditions for the ground floor flat, given likely odour impacts when the ground floor window is open.",
    "As such, the proposed bin store would have an adverse impact on the residential amenity of Flat 1 and therefore would fail to comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and SPD4."
