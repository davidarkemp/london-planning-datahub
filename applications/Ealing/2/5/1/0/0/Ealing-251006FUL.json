    "The proposed development, due to the kitchen being more than one floor distant from the bedroom in the loft and inadequate number of full sets of kitchen facilities provided for a maximum of eleven occupants, it would result in unsatisfactory standard of accommodation for an HMO and would harm the living conditions for future occupants.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), the NPPF (2025) and Ealing's HMO Standards (2025). | The proposed change of use to 6-bedroom 11 person HMO would introduce a significantly intensified use of the site that would be incongruous with the predominantly family residential character of the surrounding area.  The noticeably increased comings and goings to and from the site would also increase the noise and disturbance generated, to the detriment of neighbouring amenities.  The proposal would therefore represent a maximisation rather than optimisation of the site capacity, and is therefore contrary to policies D3, D6 and H9 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and the NPPF (2025)."
