    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, massing, bulk, and design, would appear as an incongruous and dominant addition that fails to respect the original form and character of the host property. It would harm the character and appearance of the Norwood Green Conservation Area. As such, it would be contrary to Policies D3, D4 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4, 7.B and 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policy DAA of the Ealing Draft Local Plan (Regulation 22), and the Ealing Generic Conservation Area Management Plan (2023). | The site lies partially within Flood Zones 2 and 3, and the applicant has not demonstrated that the development is appropriate for this level of flood risk. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy 5.12 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
