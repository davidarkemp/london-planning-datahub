    "The proposed vehicular crossover by reason of exceeding the 2.4m standard width specification for a single crossover would interrupt the footway for a width of 4.8m, it would also present a safety risk to pedestrians and set a precedent for other such crossovers having a cumulative safety impact and loss of distinct public and private space within the street scene, harming both safety and amenity. As such, the proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2024 sections 8 and 12, policies D8, T3 and T4 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7.4 Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's Local Plan (Reg.22) and The Vehicle Crossovers: Application Pack for Residents (2021)"
