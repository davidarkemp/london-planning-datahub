    "The submitted Details of demolition method statement/construction management plan pursuant to condition 11 of planning permission Ref: 205302FUL dated 13.04.2022, are deemed to be unsatisfactory and do not meet the requirements of the condition. The Council Officers have attempted to receive further information and clarifications, however, no response has been received within a reasonable timeframe. The proposal would therefore fail to adhere to the objective of providing details of  demolition method statement/construction management plan in accordance with policy 1.1(j) of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policy 7A of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) and Interim guidance SPG 10 'Noise and Vibration'."
