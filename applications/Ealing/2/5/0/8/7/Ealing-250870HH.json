    "The proposed side/rear extension, by way of its siting, width and height would disrupt the prevailing character of Edison Drive and would detract from the consistency in build and sight lines present within the urban context including the open character of the grass verge and footpath area. The proposed extension would constitute as unsympathetic development within the application site and its surroundings, failing to adhere to the character and design language.",
    "As such, this application fails to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
