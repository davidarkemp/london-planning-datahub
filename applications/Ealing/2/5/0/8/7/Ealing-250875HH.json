    "By way of its design, scale and siting, the proposed side extension would not appear to be subordinate to the host dwelling, resulting in harm to the character, appearance and visual amenity of the surrounding area and the street scene. The application therefore fails to comply with Policies D4 and D5 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013) and Stage B: Design Guidance of the Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022). | By way of its design, scale and siting, the proposed side extension would create an unreasonable sense of enclosure to the detriment of the neighbouring site at 33 Ferrymead Avenue. The application therefore fails to comply with Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
