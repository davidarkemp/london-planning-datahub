SKA GF 05 90 01), and managing these habitats for at least 30 years from when you complete creating or enhancing the habitat to satisfy this condition.",
    "The Local Planning Authority has several powers to efficiently monitor biodiversity net gain, including Planning Contravention Notices (PCN), which are a requisition for information from landowners or operators. Non-compliance with a Planning Contravention Notice or providing misinformation can result in prosecution and fines.",
    "If the habitat enhancement does not go as planned and the 123.1% biodiversity net gain cannot be achieved, you must notify the planning authority immediately.",
