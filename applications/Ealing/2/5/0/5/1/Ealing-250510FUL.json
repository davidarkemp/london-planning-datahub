    "The proposal, by reason of its design, depth, scale, bulk and overall dimensions, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, that would cause harm to the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with policies D1 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7.4 and LV7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Ealing Housing Guidance (2022), Policy DAA of Ealing's Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19) and SPD4 - Residential Extensions. | The proposed outrigger extension, by reason of its siting, depth and proximity to No.62 Church Road would result in an unneighbourly and overbearing form of development, resulting in harm to the occupants of this adjoining property in terms of loss of light outlook and an increased sense of enclosure. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with policy 7B of the Ealing's Development Management DPD (2013) and policies D1, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DAA of Ealing's Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19)."
