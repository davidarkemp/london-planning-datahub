    "The proposed development, by reason of the increased hardstanding and loss of soft landscaping, would be out of keeping with the verdant character of the surrounding area. Furthermore, the inaccuracies in the submitted plans fail to provide sufficient information for the Council to fairly assess the cumulative impact of the proposal on the area. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D4 of the London Plan 2021 and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD 2013. | The proposed dropped kerb would not allow vehicles to enter and exit the site in a forward gear. Its location adjacent to on-street parking and a junction could result in inadequate visibility splay and vehicles queuing on the street, to the detriment of road safety. As such, the proposed development is contrary to policy T4 of the London Plan 2021."
