    "The proposed increase to the height of the ridge, by reason of its design, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, that would disrupt the uniformity of the ridge line of the terrace, causing demonstrable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenity of the street scene. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policy D4 of the London Plan, Policy 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan and Council's Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
