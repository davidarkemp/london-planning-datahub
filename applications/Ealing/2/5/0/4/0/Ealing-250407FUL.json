    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension, by way of its length, would constitute an illogical and dominant form of development to the application site. The proposed first floor element would result in an increase in mass and bulk highly visible from Brentmead Gardens and Spencer Close which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the original building.",
    "As such, it is considered that the proposal would be unacceptable in terms of its scale and design and would not comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B, and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed refuse storage, by way of its positioning, would result in an adverse impact on the residential amenity of proposed flat 1 by way of loss of privacy, sense of overlooking and disturbance due to unpleasant odour emissions.",
    "The proposed refuse store would be situated in front of a bedroom window of flat 1, resulting in direct overlooking and impacted residential amenity.",
