    "Unsatisfactory and inaccurate plans and supporting documentation have been submitted that have failed to demonstrate that the proposed windows would be a veracious replacement and would not cause harm to the character and appearance of the Hanger Hill (Haymills) Estate Conservation Area. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Chapter 16 of the NPPF, Policy HC1 of the London Plan, Policy 7C of the Ealing Development Management DPD and Council's Generic Conservation Area Management Plan."
