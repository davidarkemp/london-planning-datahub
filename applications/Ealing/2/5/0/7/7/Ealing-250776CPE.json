    "The submitted evidence as required under Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), has failed to demonstrate, on the balance of probability, that part of the flat being used as a medical clinic is 'not development'. The extent of operation would result in a change of use and would be considered to be development as defined by Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.  It is therefore recommended that a Lawful Development Certificate is refused and planning permission would be required."
