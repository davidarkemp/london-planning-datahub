    "The proposed mansard roof and dormer windows, by reason of their bulk, scale and overall design, would constitute an incongruous and discordant form of development, that would cause harm to the character and appearance of the area and the visual amenity of the streetscene. The proposal would accordingly fail to comply with Policy DAA of the Draft Ealing Local Plan, Policy 7B and LV7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD, Policy D4 of the London Plan and Council's Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
