    "The proposed back garden development, by reason of its siting, scale, bulk, and design within the rear gardens of 52A Studley Grange Road would represent a dominant and incongruous form of development that would result in harmful visual impacts to this neighbouring property, overdevelopment of this site and reduce the spaciousness of the overall locality, to the detriment of the visual amenity and character of the wider area. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Section 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 1.1 (e) (i) and 3.8 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012) and policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development due to insufficient private amenity space, inadequate provision of sunlight, and due to length, width and distance would result in an unwelcoming, inappropriate, impracticable, access to the dwellinghouse, would result in detrimental and unsuitable living conditions. Therefore, the proposal would fail to comply with policies D3, D4 and D6 of the London Plan 2021, London Housing Design Guidance 2023, policies 7A and 7B of the Ealing DPD 2013. | The proposal, due to the location of the cycle storage and bin storage, and the impractical access  to it, would result in inadequate cycle and bin storage provisions adopted by the Local Planning Authority, contrary to policies T3, T5, SI7 and SI8 of the London Plan 2021 and adopted Development (or Core) Strategy (2012), as well as the National Planning Policy Framework (2024)."
