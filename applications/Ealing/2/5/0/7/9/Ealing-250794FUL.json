    "The proposed rear mansard roof extension and external staircase to rear, by reason of scale, width, height, bulk, prominence and visual impact would be an obtrusive, illogical and overdominant form of development that would cause unacceptable disruption to the local roofscape and would result in harm to and out of keeping with the character and appearance of the local area. As such, the development would therefore fail to comply with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013).",
    "| The proposed external staircase to rear, by reason of its design and scale, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties in terms of loss of privacy. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013)."
