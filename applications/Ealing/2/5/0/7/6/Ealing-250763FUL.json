    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, would be insubordinate to the host building and out of keeping to the pattern of development of the area, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed development is not considered to be in accordance with policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (Regulation 19), and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022). | The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height and proximity to the boundary, would create significant overshadowing, loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the residential amenity of Flat 1, 56 Gordon Road. As such, the proposal is contrary policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), policy DAA of Ealing's draft new Local Plan (2024), and Ealing Housing Design Guidance (2022)."
