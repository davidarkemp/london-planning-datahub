    "The proposed part second floor rear extension and roof extension, by reason of their height, bulk, depth, design and cumulative impact would fail to harmonise with the original building on the site and would constitute an incongruous and dominant addition to the building and local area that would result in being out of keeping with the character and general pattern of area, and which results in the overdevelopment of the site, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host building and local area. The development would therefore fail to comply with D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), policies 7B and 7.4 of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, by reason of its size, scale, height, and its proximity to site boundaries, would adversely affect the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The proposed development would appear overdominant and overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties and would result in creation of sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and loss of daylight and sunlight to the neighbours. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies and would not comply with the objectives of the policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan (2021), policy 7.4, 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013). | The proposed development, due to its substandard outdoor amenity space would result in detrimentally substandard living conditions for prospective occupants. As such, the proposal is contrary to policies 3.5, 7.4, 7A, 7B and 7D of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), Policies H9, D1, D3, D4, D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021)."
