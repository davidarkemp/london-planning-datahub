    "The development to which this permission relates shall be begun not later than the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.",
    "Reason: To comply with Section 91 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990. | The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with drawing/document title number(s): Location plan, 25/3657/01 (existing site plan), 25/3657/02 B (proposed site plan), 25/3657/03 A (existing floor plans), 25/3657/04 B (proposed floor plans), 25/3657/05 (existing elevations), 25/3657/06 A (proposed elevations), 25/3657/07 A (existing and proposed street scene).",
    "Reason: For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning. | All external materials to be used in the development shall match the appearance of those of the existing building, unless otherwise stated in the submitted application form or approved drawings.",
    "Reason: To ensure that the materials harmonise with the surroundings, in accordance with policies 1.1 & 1.2 of the Ealing Core Strategy (2012), policies 7.4 & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the National Planning Policy Framework (2024).",
    "| The site is within the worst mode aircraft 1-day noise contour predicted for 2016 (57dB) (See Appendix 5 SPG10). Before the development is commenced, a desk top study shall be submitted for approval by the Council in writing, for the sound insulation of the building envelope, based on the aircraft noise contour spectrum specified in Section 6 Supplementary Planning Guidance 10, and which will achieve the internal criteria for noise sensitive rooms. The details should also include the provision of alternative means of acoustically attenuated ventilation and cooling, as necessary, (with air intake from the cleanest aspect of the building and low self-noise), in accordance with the Council's criteria. The works should be completed before occupation and permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: In the interests of the living conditions of the future occupiers of the site in accordance with policies 7A & 7B of the Ealing Development Management Development Plan Document (2013), policies 1.1 and 1.2 of the Ealing Development (Core) Strategy (2012), policies D6 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) and Ealing SPG10. | Cycle storage shall be provided within the curtilage of the development, within secure, lockable compounds in accordance with the designated locations identified in the approved drawings listed under condition 2 and all adopted standards prior to the first occupation of the building. The storage spaces shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To provide adequate bicycle storage in accordance with policy and T5 of the London Plan (2021). | Prior to first occupation of the hereby approved development, refuse and recycling storage shall be provided within the flat and shall be permanently retained thereafter.",
    "Reason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory facilities for the storage of refuse and recycling material, in accordance with policy SI 7 of the London Plan (2021)."
