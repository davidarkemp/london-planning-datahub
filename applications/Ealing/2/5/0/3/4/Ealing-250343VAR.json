    "Due to the proposed frequency of the changes in advertisements, the proposed variation to condition 9 changing the display time of the advertisement display from 30 seconds to 10 seconds would have an adverse impact to the highway safety of Uxbridge Road, causing a distraction to pedestrians, motorists and cyclists.",
    "It is not considered that the reduction in display time has been justified adequately to mitigate the potential impact to the highway safety. The decrease to 10 second intervals is not appropriate for the high-street environment.",
    "As such, this application fails to comply with policies Policy T3 and T4 of the London Plan 2021 and The Planning Practice Guidance (2021)."
