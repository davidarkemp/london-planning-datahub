    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed structure would constitute a caravan, a defined by the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act and Caravan Sites Act, as the submitted information has failed to demonstrate the ability to move the structure as a single unit once assembled or built.   Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the structure is not a building.  Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the use would be restricted to those who are part of the household occupying the main house. As such, the council is not satisfied that the proposal would not constitute the carrying out of building and operational activities, and/or result in a material change of use of the land, as defined by s55(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act, neither of which is lawful without permission. | The proposed development falls outside the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) (England) Order 2015 as amended. It is therefore unlawful."
