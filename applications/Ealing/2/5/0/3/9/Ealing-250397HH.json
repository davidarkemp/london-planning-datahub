  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, due to the excessive scale, bulk, and massing of the single storey side/rear extension along the western boundary, would result in an unneighbourly form of development that significantly increases the sense of enclosure and leads to increased overshadowing of No. 68 Rosemont Road. This would cause an unacceptable loss of residential amenity for the occupiers of that property. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013) and Policy DAA of the Ealing draft Local Plan (Regulation 22). | The proposed development, by virtue of the inadequate design and width of the side accesses adjacent to the proposed extensions, would result in a poor standard of layout. The side accesses would be neither fully functional nor easily accessible and would compromise the practical usability and quality of the overall design. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021), Policies 7.4 and 7B of the Ealing Development Management DPD (2013), and Policy DAA of the Ealing draft Local Plan (Regulation 22)."
