  "description": "Dina wines Ltd (Dee-nuh) is predominantly a shop focussing on \"natural\" wines and British provisions such as cheese and charcuterie. We are here to serve the neighbourhood! A change of use is needed from A1 to A4 as customers are able to have a glass of wine or 3 when time comes to 4pm to 11pm (no later). Food will be served albeit focussing on small cold plates - British cheeses and charcuteries therefore not needing an external flute. Dina wines will also provide online services from which the location will fulfil local deliveries by foot or cycle. Dina is unique to the area providing the local community inclusive insights into the natural wine movement at accessible prices. Dina also plans to import wines. Negotiations with landlord are in place.",
