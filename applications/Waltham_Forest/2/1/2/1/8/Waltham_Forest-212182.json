  "description": "Installation of one column and one feeder pillar. The proposed columns will be 6m tall and have an outside diameter of 155mm at the tallest point and approximately 177mm at the widest base point. A 700mm high steel feeder pillar will be installed adjacent to each column. The feeder pillar will house the isolation point for the power required by the column. The columns are upstanding in use. However, for maintenance activity the columns fold downwards and will require a working area of approximately 6m by 2m (as illustrated by the red site boundaries on the attached plans).",
