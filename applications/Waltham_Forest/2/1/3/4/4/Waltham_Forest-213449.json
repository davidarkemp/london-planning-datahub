The amendments would increase the size of the entrance lobbies of Blocks D and E,  by 6.5 sqm. and include alterations to the position of external doors that would access the plant rooms on Blocks A, B and E, by reason of maintenance and alterations to the positioning of the refuse stores. The proposed amendments also seek to add a cycle store between Blocks F and G and change the internal layout of the approved cycle store on Block J to include a mezzanine, due to the height of the cycle store and would also regularize a new parking arrangement around Blocks D, F,  J and G. The changes would not involve a reduction to cycle spaces.",
