  "description": "North Falls is a proposed offshore wind farm located in the southern North Sea, approximately 20 kilometres from the East Anglia coast at its nearest point. An offer has been accepted from National Grid for an onshore grid connection in Tendring, North Essex, approximately 20 kilometres from its likely landfall location for that connection option near Frinton-on-Sea. North Falls is set to support the UK’s target of 50GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030. The Project comprises: • Up to 72 offshore wind turbine generators • Up to two offshore substation platforms • Platform interconnector cables • Inter-array cables • Options for transmission infrastructure including: Option 1: Onshore electrical connection at a National Grid connection point within Tendring, Essex, with a project alone onshore cable route and onshore substation infrastructure; Option 2: Onshore electrical connection at a National Grid connection point within Tendring, Essex, sharing all or part of an onshore cable route with separate onshore export cables with another project (such as Five Estuaries) where practicable, or Option 3: Offshore electrical connection supplied by a third-party electricity network provider. Such a connection will potentially be identified through the Offshore Transmission Network Review (OTNR) process.",
