    "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14pt&quot;&gt;The existing single storey extension being&amp;nbsp;used as a mixed use commercial space comprising food consumption and&amp;nbsp;Shisha Lounge, by reason of its design, siting and proximity to nearby residential dwellings is detrimental to the occupiers of these properties and gives rise to an unacceptable level of noise and odour that is harmful to the amenities of the neighbouring residents. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CS13 and CS15 of the Waltham Local Forest Plan - Core Strategy (2012) and Policy DM32 of the Waltham Forest Local Plan â€“ Development Management Policies (2013).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
