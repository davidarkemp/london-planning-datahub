  "description": "Internal renovation works to optimise the circulation and flow of the apartment by relocating the stair from its current position within mezzanine, this is moved centrally to avoid any implications of the external fabric; reconfigation of mezzanine to provide additional bedroom space; the existing double door to the living room have been relocated along the same wall to align to the existing entrance door of the apartment; this will improve the flow and circulation of the unit; new double door to provide a second, more direct means of access to kitchen/dining from the rooms facing the stairwell lobby; general replacement of joinery and refurbishment of all bathrooms with all service routes to be retained; new partitions in isolated locations to improve the general format of the apartment; the existing mezzanine wall in the master bedroom is to be moved by 700mm to provide additional space to the master suite; removal of glazed opening present to the mezzanine corridor which is seen to balance the new opening of the double doors to the dining room",
