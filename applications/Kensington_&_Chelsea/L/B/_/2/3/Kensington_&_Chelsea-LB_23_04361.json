As set out within the Planning Statement that accompanies the latest submission, this latest Listed Building Consent submission follows an appeal decision in February 2022, which was dismissed (ref. no: APP/K5600/W/20/3264406). The appeal was concerned with application ref. PP/20/00419, dated 21 January 2020, which proposed the Amalgamation of Flats A and C to form a single dwelling and associated internal and external works to building and garden including replacement of basement.\n\nAlthough the appeal was dismissed, the Appeal Decision stated that the other physical works proposed were deemed acceptable, while it also recognised the positive heritage improvements which would be delivered by virtue of the proposals. The Heritage implications were covered by a Heritage Report prepared by Turleys Heritage and Listed Building Consent was duly granted in 2020 under the previous application. As such, we consider there to be no conflict in heritage terms, as the proposals remain unchanged in the context of the heritage works proposed. \n\nThe latest planning application (this submission) and listed building consent applications (submitted via the planning portal under separate cover), follow on from a full planning application (PP/22/07891) and listed building consent application (LB/23/00673) which were withdrawn in May 2023 at the request of RBKC Planning Officers, so as to allow for a new Tree Survey to be undertaken. This has since taken place and the new planning and listed building consent applications are now supported by an updated Arboricultural Impact Assessment (AIA) produced by Landmark Trees.",
