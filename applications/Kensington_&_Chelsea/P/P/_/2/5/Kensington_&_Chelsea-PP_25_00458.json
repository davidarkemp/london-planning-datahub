By moving the structures further east they are further away from neighbours, thereby reducing impacts to residential amenity; a modest number (with a further six spaces proposed for 2025) of reduced mobility parking spaces, restricted to those who require them; andthe repositioning of the majority of the generators and other plant equipment to the east of the main structure.",
