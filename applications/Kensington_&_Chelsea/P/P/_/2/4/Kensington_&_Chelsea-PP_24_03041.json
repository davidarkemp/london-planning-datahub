          "description": "The artwork will be installed on the front area on Dovehouse Green that is presently paved in York Stone. This area is marked in red on the attached maps. A freestanding plaque/information lectern will be installed close to the art work. Both items will be fixed into the ground as permanent pieces. \n\nAt this moment in time, until the sculpture has been installed, the exact location of the plaque/information lectern has not been determined as it is advisable that the artwork is installed first to then take a view on the most ideal location from a viewers/readers perspective. This is why planning permission is being sought for the whole of the front of Dovehouse Green. The attached documentation offers an illustration of the spatial relationship between sculpture and the freestanding plaque/information lectern.\n\nThe area is a mostly triangular shape measuring approximately 50m to the front with two sides approximately 40m in length. Within the area edged in red on the Site Plan the art work base will occupy a space measuring 3.6m width x 2.7m depth. The location will be within the front section of the Green where the benches have been laid out in a V shape in advance, as part of the previous works undertaken by Kensington and Chelsea Council. ",
