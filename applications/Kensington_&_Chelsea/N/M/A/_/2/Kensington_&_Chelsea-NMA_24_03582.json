The consented application allows for a lateral extension to the existing basement area; however a revised strategy is hereby proposed which retains the existing basement width, but lowers the floor level by approximately 505mm from the existing floor level. The stairs would also be lowered in line with the slab level. The lateral extension would therefore no longer be required.",
