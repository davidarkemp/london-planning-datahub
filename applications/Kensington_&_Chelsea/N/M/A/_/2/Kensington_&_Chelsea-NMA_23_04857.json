  "description": "Non-material amendment to planning permision PP/18/05740 (Variation of condition 2 (approved drawings) of planning permission 17/00526 for changes to approved scheme) for reconfiguration for a number of windows; introduction of new arched lintels above a number of windows; removal of glazing bars (that were introduced in PP/18/0570) from 3rd floor window to match design of lower levels. This window also spans across 2 floors (Flats 12 and 13); a fire rated spandrel panel is therefore required between the two parts to provide the required sound and fire protection whilst still visually reading as a single window; removal of 2 windows from consented rear elevation at 3rd and 4th floor level which serve living spaces that already have windows. These windows did not previously exist (see existing drawings for PP/17/00526). The original consent (PP/17/00526) then introduced 1 of the windows at 3rd floor level which was not aligned; the second window at 4th floor level was then introduced under PP/18/05740. Parapet of 3rd floor extension has been raised by approximately 640mm. Removal of brick set back at first floor level (approximately 100mm).",
