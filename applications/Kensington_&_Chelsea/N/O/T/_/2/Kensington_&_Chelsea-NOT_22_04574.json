  "description": "Construction of an extension to existing operational building at the above site under permitted development rights. The extension is required to comply with Thames Water's obligations under the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 to provide adequate welfare facilities and the associated 'Approved Code of Practice' prepared by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).Therefore, we are informally notifying you of the proposals in line with the guidance at paragraph 069 of the National Planning Practice Guidance (Reference ID:13-068- 20140306) which encourages informal notification. The proposed development involves the construction of a small extension to the existing building measuring approximately 3.5m x 2.9m x 2.7m in height. The external materials for the extension will be similar to those of the existing building.",
