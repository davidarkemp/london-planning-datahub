  "description": "Some 20+ years ago, under Listed Building Application TP98/0379, permission was granted, and work carried out to create door openings in the party wall between these two buildings. The openings were formed at basement and at 5th Floor level. It is now intended to close these openings and reinstate the party wall to its fully separating function. The work will consist of masonry infill and will not affect the existing building fabric in any way. The new work will be plaster finished on both sides to match the existing and rendered invisible to the eye. As the proposal will not affect the fabric and will revert both buildings to their original state, we would appreciate your confirmation that this work will not require a new application. \n\nThis proposal does not affect any floor space.",
