  "description": "Refurbishment and renovation of flat 5 within 62 Queens Gate. Stripping out all sanitaryware and existing bathroom finishing and replace with new. The existing bathrooms are as per the original layout of the flat. However, all finishing and sanitaryware within the bathrooms are modern. Create an opening within the wall separating the kitchen and living room to create a linked space in order to mirror that of flat 6. The radiator will be re-positioned to the adjacent wall and the dado rail within that location only, will be removed. The existing secondary glazing to the Living room windows and French door are in a terrible condition and will be replaced with new to match existing.  All ceiling mounted luminaries are to be replaced with new Phillip's Hue WIFI controlled recessed spot lights in existing position. The doors to the Master Bedroom and en-suite are to be made higher and the opening / door for the storage cupboard within corridor area will be relocated within the bathroom to create a washer and dryer cupboard. Sub-sequentially, the opening within the corridor will be closed up.",
