  "description": "It is not proposed to make any changes to the external appearance of the front facade - which is well preserved. However, some essential repair works are proposed in order to protect the architectural value of the property. The first floor, timber sash windows onto the square are rotting and in a very sorry state. Our proposal is to replace the glass with new heritage style single glazing - to improve the thermal performance without compromising on the look.\n\nModern steel guarding has been fixed to the original wrought iron railings to the front lightwell. It is proposed to remove this addition, and make good the finish of the iron railings. The front lightwell staircase is a modern metal stair, and is not consistent with those at neighbouring properties. It is proposed that the stair be replaced in iron, with balustrade to match the retained lightwell railing.\n\nTo the rear we propose to replace an existing two storey modern 'glass box' infill to a higher quality of design & construction but within the existing massing. It is also proposed to add an additional storey to the brick closet wing - there is precedent for this height at number 34A Pembroke Square and 4 Pembroke Villas. The existing closet wing is relatively modern and has been much altered (as set out in the Heritage Statement). The closet wing brickwork has been painted and overclad intimber boarding at the lower level. As part of the works, it is proposed to remove the modern timber cladding, strip the paintwork with a nonabrasive\nmethod and repair the London stock brickwork, repointing where necessary with lime mortar. Furthermore, the exposed cast-iron\nsoil pipes and rainwater goods will be rationalised, and unsightly defunct pipework removed. We believe that the extension and sensitive refurbishment of the existing closet wing is entirely appropriate, as it replicates and maintains the plan form and pattern of circulation.",
