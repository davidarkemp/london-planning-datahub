  "description": "As part of the 1-5 Cromwell Place complex, there is the secondary entrance on Thurloe Place, which leads into the newly built pavilion. This is a gated entrance, with a prominent wall facing the street. As part of our 2021 programming we are very excited to have the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) exhibiting at Cromwell Place within the Pavilion. This is a huge coup for Cromwell Place and the surrounding local area, and we would like to ensure this exhibition is accessible to as many members of the public. The NPG have approached us for signage opportunities on the Thurloe Place boundary wall, and came up with a selection of options. We have reviewed these and feel the attached document showing the mock up is the most in-keeping with the local area.\n\nWe wish to have advice on two proposals. \n\nThe first is the short term option during the exhibition of the National Portrait Gallery later this autumn, where we have four banners and four light boxes. These would be up for a duration of 3 months maximum.\n\nMeasurements:\nFour Banners:\nEach banner: 550 (w) x 2300mm (h)\nDistance between each banner: 1600mm\nHeight of banner above boundary wall: 2500mm\n\nFour Light boxes:\nEach light box: 780 (w) x 1180mm (h)\nDistance between each light box: 650mm\nHeight of light box above ground: 600mm\n\nThe second proposal is a longer term solution for Cromwell Place to advertise exhibition listings. We would considerably reduce the advertising and keep it much more subtle. This is one banner and one light box. This would list out the what's on at Cromwell Place. As a reminder it is free of charge to visit Cromwell Place, except on rare occasions where our Honorary Members (most often not for profits) wish to ticket their exhibitions.\n\nMeasurements:\nOne Banner: 550 (w) x 2300mm (h)\nHeight of banner above boundary wall: 2500mm\n\nOne Light box: 780 (w) x 1180mm (h)\nHeight of light box above ground: 600mm\n\nSee document: Boundary Wall Signage mockups.",
