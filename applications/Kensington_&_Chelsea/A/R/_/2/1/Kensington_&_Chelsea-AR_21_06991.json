  "description": "The proposal consists of amendment to the internal arrangements of the two studio flats to create a single two bedroom apartment. The removal of the dividing wall between the two studios to create an open plan living area with a new enlarged opening to existing terrace, replacing double doors and window with an energy efficient, slimline glazed aluminium painted white, sliding door. Addition of a mansard roof to the rear of the property is proposed with two dormer windows set behind the existing parapet wall and aligned with windows below to create en-suite bedroom in the existing loft space.",
