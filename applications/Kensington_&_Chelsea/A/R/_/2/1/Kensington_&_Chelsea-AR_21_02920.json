  "description": "The proposed works include the internal refurbishment of the interior with upgraded fittings, reinstatement of period features, such as cornice, architraves and dado rails, reinstatement of lost room layouts on principle floors, removal of downlights and rationalisation of rear soil vent & rain water pipework to the rear elevation. \nIt is proposed to carry out some minimal internal alterations namely, lowering of the cill at UGF and re-siting the sash window and removal of double doors at LGF, both to allow direct access through to the proposed glass, rear extension.\nWorks also include the raising of the closet wing to form a new storey and 2-storey extension at LGF & UGF levels in a lightweight glass and metal framing. \nIt is also proposed to re-build the rear party wall with No.18 that is in a state of disrepair and general rear landscaping works.",
