  "description": "The proposed works include a replacement 'like for like' conservatory and new fitted wardrobes.  While planning permission is not required, advice is sought on whether listed building consent is required, and if so, if the proposals would be considered acceptable. \n The works are considered de-minimis and 'like for like' alterations to already modernised parts of the property, therefore not requiring listed building consent.\n\n1. Replacement Rear Conservatory (Single Glazing to Slimline Double Glazing)\n\nThe rear conservatory was erected in the 1980s, under planning permission TP/79/1235.  The conservatory now requires replacement glazing to resolve leak issues.  The new owners propose replacing the conservatory with a 'like for like' replacement, with the only difference being changing the single glazed panels to slimline double glazed panels to secure thermal efficiencies consistent with current building regulations.  \n\nThe current glazing is c. 4mm wide and the new slimline double glazing would be up to 14mm wide, which would be an imperceptible change.  It is also noted that the LPA has recently granted consent for double glazed conservatories along this terraced row (at Nos. 23 and 33 Royal Avenue).\n\nAs the works are effectively 'like for like' and would have no impact on the character of this modernised part of the property, we trust listed building consent is not required.\n\n2. New Wardrobes\n\nThe property has been thoroughly modernised internally, with contemporary fixtures and fittings (as consented under LB/07/2272).  This includes extensive fitted wardrobes in one of the bedrooms.\n \nThe new owners would like to install a new fitted wardrobe in Bedroom 2 (traditional panelled style in dark moss green) and renew the wardrobe in Bedroom 3 (shaker style in muted mouse brown colour) (photographed above).  These proposed wardrobe locations are shown on the annotated plans. \n\nIn the context of these bedrooms having already been modernised, and the proposed materials being sympathetic to the host building, we trust listed building consent is not required.",
