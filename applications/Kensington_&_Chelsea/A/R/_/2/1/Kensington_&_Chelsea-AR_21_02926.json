  "description": "Like for like replacement of skirtings and cornices where required and reinstatement of the original cornices on the ground and first floors. Replacement of modern downlight in the lower ground floor with a more discrete fitting and replacement of downlights in the modern north wing with discrete directional spotlights. As part of the proposed works, we are also proposing to replace the fireplaces, and reinstate one fireplace that has been blocked on the first floor. The second-floor bathroom finished are proposed to be updated with wooden panelling applied to the walls and the existing stone floor to be replaced with marble. The first floor doors to the balconies require replacement, as there has been significant damage to them throughout the years and repair works would not be sufficient. On the south wing, we are proposing to omit the door to the boot room which is a modern addition to the original fabric. On the first and second floors on that same wing, we are proposing to replace the double doors to the powder room and shower rooms with single doors.",
