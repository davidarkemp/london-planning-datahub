  "description": "The applicant wishes to assess whether the proposal for level access adaptions would be acceptable before moving forward with purchasing the property. The potential buyer of 33 Ovington Square has a daughter who requires a wheelchair. Therefore level access is needed from the street and to use the existing lift. There is currently not sufficient consideration of disabled access as there is no level access from the front door to the lift, nor from the street itself to the front door.",
