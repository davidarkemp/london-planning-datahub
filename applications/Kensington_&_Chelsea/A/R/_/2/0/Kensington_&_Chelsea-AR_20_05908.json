  "description": "The proposal is to replace the existing tiling to the basement access steps and hardstanding to the front elevation of the property with new tiling. The existing tiling was laid within the last 10 - 20 years, it is not an original feature, and certainty does not pre-date 1st July 1948. The new tiling to the access steps will be of a black and white Victorian design, with the tiling to the hardstanding being white (to match the white tiles within the design to the access steps). We consider that proceeding on this basis will enhance the character of the property, as the new Victorian design will be far more suitable for a property of this age and design. As outlined, the existing tiles are not original and are not in keeping with the aesthetics of the property, it is therefore hoped that full planning consent will not be required and we can proceed with the proposed works as soon as possible.",
