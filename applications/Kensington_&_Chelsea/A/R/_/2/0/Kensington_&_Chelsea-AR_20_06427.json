  "description": "The proposal relates to a set of five exterior projects and two interior projects at Leighton House which are extensions of the current capital refurbishment of the 'Perrin Wing' of the building.  The external works are intended to enhance the authenticity and quality of the presentation of the exterior of the house, its forecourt and garden and consist of: proposed new lettering to the boundary wall; the reinstatement of the forecourt including new gates; the removal of three trees from inside the boundary wall; the complete redecoration of the exterior of the museum and the re-landscaping of the garden at the rear of the building to better integrate it into the life of the museum.  The interior works consist of the redecoration of the Winter Studio on the first floor to re-present it as part of the historic interiors and the reinstatement of a plaster picture frame onto the north wall of the current reception area in the museum as part of the re-presentation of this space also as part of the historic interiors.",
