  "description": "FELL 1 x Common Beech; Prune 1 x Common Beech, 1 x Common Holly, 1 x Wych Elm and 1 x Small Leaved Limefell withdrawn 16/9/21Hi Angus,Sorry for the slow response. I'm glad you flagged this, I agree with you entirely that the presence of the fungus does not automatically necessitate removal. But I didn't do the condition report or indeed make the recommendation. I was simply acting under instruction from the client who in turn was acting on the recommendation of Damian Pace who carried out the original survey.It turns out that unbeknown to me they did in fact act upon my advice back in March to instruct Kim Gifford to carry out a Picus test. I just called to speak with the property manager and she apologised that I had not been made aware. A copy of this is attached and pleasingly it recommends the trunk is in good condition 30cm above ground level and that the tree does not need to be removed. Why they still proceeded to instruct us to go ahead with applying to fell it I have absolutely no idea. That's managing agents for you I guess, quite astonishing! The tree is saved and they save themselves a lot of cash, a happy ending all around.So please accept this email as formal notification that we wish to withdraw any proposed works to T1 Beech from application ref. 21 5038 (ID1237). Thanks,Ed Payne.",
