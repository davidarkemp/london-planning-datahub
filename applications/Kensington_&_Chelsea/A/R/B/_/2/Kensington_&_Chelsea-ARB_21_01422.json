  "description": "(T3) K6 G2. Lime tree (Tilia platyphyllos) This tree is one of fifteen Lime trees that run from number 1 Russell Rd to 15 Russell Rd. Mostly two in a garden. As far as I can see this is the only one in bad condition. This tree has been dead/dying for some number of years. At some point the crown has fallen down and been removed leaving just the stem and a few dead branches. When pushing the stem with my body weight I can feel the loss of the root system and suspect one good push would tip it over. Also some wood has been falling from the top of the tree into the neighbouring garden, onto a seating area that is in use. And will be used more frequently now the seasons have changed. The stem is approximately 4 metres tall. Suggested works: Remove by sectional takedown. This tree is dead and I consider it a significant danger to people and other targets in all four gardens that are in close proximity. I would like to apply for a five day notice.",
