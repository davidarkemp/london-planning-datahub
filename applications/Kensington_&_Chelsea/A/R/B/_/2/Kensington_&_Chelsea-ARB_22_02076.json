If you decide to revise the s.211 we would raise no objection to the following works:ÿLondon plane - Crown thin by 20% and cut back from building to provide 4 metres clearance.Horse chestnut - Remove epicormic growth to crown break and cut back from street lamp to provide 2 metres clearance.ÿPlease respond to us by 25 April 2022 confirming your preferred course of action. If we have not heard from you by this date or you decide not to withdraw or revise this s.211notification, we will include the trees in a Tree Preservation Order.ÿWe look forward to hearing from you.ÿKind regardsÿStephen Fuller Senior Arboricultural Officer Planning and Place, Development ManagementRoyal Borough of Kensington and ChelseaÿTel: 07739 313732ÿÿTown Hall, Hornton Street, London, W8 ÿwww.rbkc.gov.ukÿ",
