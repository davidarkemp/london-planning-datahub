  "description": "amend to retrosptove??? Erection of metal railing on flat roof at third storey level to ensure safety of roof terrace. ---for amenity purposes----\r\nPlan showing location of proposed railing enclosed. As shown on enclosed plan 1216-04, roof terrace adjoins spare bedroom / study. It is proposed that the railing is sufficiently set back from the front boundary of the roof terrace (the western edge) to ensure that the railing will not be visible from street level when looking at the front of the house (front elevation plan enclosed 1216-07). Some of the rear elevation of the property can be seen at street level from further down Milton Park (heading in a NNE direction). As such, the northern edge of the proposed railing (along the rear elevation) will be visible at street level from further down Milton Park (photgraphs 1a, 1b and 1c enclosed to show visibility of rear elevation at street level). Photograph 2 showing one panel of the proposed railing (already erected prior to obtaining consent) enclosed, showing style of proposed railing. Photograph 2 also shows the extent to which neighbouring gardens are overlooked (covered table and blue trellising shown in photograph are within the boundary and part of the garden of 43 Hornsey Lane Gardens, applicant's property).",
