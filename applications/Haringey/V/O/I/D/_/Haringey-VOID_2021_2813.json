  "description": "Proposed works are to remove the run down existing shed which has a garage door to rear facade, and replace with new garden room with door to rear and glass doors to front, within the existing boundary of the property. The new outbuilding would be half a meter longer than the existing shed and located 1m further into the boundary line to enlarge existing parking location to the rear. The square meter size of the new room would be the same as the existing garage in total as 100mm narrower on front facade. Overall size is 17.8 sqm. The neighbouring school have been approached and are supporting of these works",
