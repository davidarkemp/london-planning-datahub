  "description": "Our apartment spans the first and second floor. During the hot summer days the second floor reaches temperatures into the high 30 degrees, during the super hot days of the last weeks, it was even 45 degrees Celsius.\r\nAs we have the bedrooms upstairs including a room we're fitting out for our 5-month-old baby, we are planning a number of things to protect against the increasingly hot weather.\r\nOne is to implement isolation in walls and roof. The other important one is installing an air conditioning system, for which this application is for. Planned air conditioning installation for 2 rooms is as follows:\r\n- Room 1 (master bedroom with small work area): 30 sqm, internal unit wall-mounted\r\n- Room 2 (children room): 17 sqm, internal unit also wall-mounted\r\n- Both internal units supported by one external unit, wall-mounted on the rear side of the house on the second floor\r\nPlease see plan attached to this application",
