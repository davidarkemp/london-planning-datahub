  "description": "The two current static cricket practice nets at our grounds are at the very end of their useful life and were last refurbished in 2014. Since then, our membership numbers have grown dramatically and now we have 320 Juniors (boys and girls), 95 Senior players (61 men and 34 women) and 24 Students (13 men and 11 women). Plus another 102 non-playing members. North London CC fields 5 Saturday sides in the Middlesex County Cricket League, 2 Women's sides in the Middlesex Women's League, an U21 Middlesex Development League Team, a Sunday League Team and 14 Junior boys and girls teams playing in the Middlesex Junior Leagues and friendlies matches. NLCC also hosts blind / impaired sight cricket events and disability training events. Two static practice nets now are not enough to provide adequate opportunities for our enlarged membership and visitors, and so the proposal is to remove the two existing static nets and replace them with four static nets, within a secure cage (we have suffered with years of vandalism problems to our facilities).",
