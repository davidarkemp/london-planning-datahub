  "description": "The changes are mainly around the entrance/parking arrangement and minor changes to the elevations. Please see the amended drawings attached, revisions to drawings listed below: New landscaping scheme with new crossover to access the proposed new parking area for No. 50A Re-location of bin store and cycle store Off street parking omitted to No. 50 Amendments to soft landscaping. The soft landscaping scheme originally retained the ash tree (marked T07) on the plans, this tree is in poor condition and it is proposed to now remove and replace with a new specimen tree after the construction of the house. Minor fenestration changes to the front elevation - removal of the projecting window surround to 1st floor window and amendments to the window framing. Minor fenestration changes to the north elevation - window enlarged (obscure glass) We have applied for a vehicle crossover and obtained a conditional approval - I.D. 6939, dated 09/04/2020",
