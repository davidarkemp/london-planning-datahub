  "description": "Works to tree protected by a TPO:\r\nT1 - OAK - FELL\r\nThe tree works are proposed to stop the influence of the tree(s) on the soil below building foundation level and provide long term stability to our policyholders property 1 Eastern Road. Estimated costs of repair to the building are �22k if the influence of the tree(s) remain and �20.9k if the proposed tree works are allowed to proceed. Granting permission will limit these costs. In the event of a refusal we, or our clients, will seek to secure compensation for the additional costs incurred through Section 202(e). Should the tree/s remain the total cost of repairs will be the Superstructural repairs + Alternative method of repairs = �42.9k, It is the expert opinion of both the case engineer and arboriculturalist that on the balance of probabilities the supporting information demonstrates the influence of the tree(s). Note: Further monitoring results may be submitted if these become available during the course of this application.",
