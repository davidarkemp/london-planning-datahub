  "description": "Works to trees protected by a TPO\r\nAsh (T1) - Prune back to the boundary line of 4 Broughton Gardens. The tree is mostly growing over the boundary line of 4 Broughton Gardens and blocks a lot of light to the garden and property. The tree provides limited amenity value and there would be minimal impact on the public amenity. Current height 18m. Final height after pruning, 10m.\r\nAsh (T2) - Reduce the height of the tree by 5m. Due the tree's close proximity to the adjacent trees, it has grown very tall with a high canopy. On a mild day the stem moves significantly. There is concern that the tree may fail in high wind and hit the house at 4 Broughton Gardens. Current height 19m. Final height after pruning, 14m.\r\nSycamore (T3) - Prune back to the boundary line of 4 Broughton Gardens (approx 3m off lateral branches and diagonal stems). To let more light into the garden of No.4. Current height 12m.",
