Condition/Notes - Poor: In rear garden, two fungal brackets at base, neighbours complaining, surface roots, damaging retaining wall, pruned to LBH specification in 2020 and since grown back, TPO put on tree because of historic dispute between neighbours no longer in residence. Recommendation - Reduce to pollard at 12-13m to reduce risk posed by fungal infection.",
