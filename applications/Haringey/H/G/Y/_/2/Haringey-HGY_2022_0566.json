This will equate to removing up to 5m of wood from each branch. That the two large branches(3 & 4) extending northeast towards the bus stop area be reduced by approximately 50% of their whole length. This will equate to removing up to 5m of wood from each branch. That the remaining crown is reduced to match to leave a balanced shape.",
