  "description": "Works to trees protected by a TPO\r\nWe have two limes trees directly at the back of our garden between Springcroft Avenue and Western Road. These trees are protected with a TPO. We are intending on having a garden room built in front of these trees and will get an arboricultural survey carried out to ensure these trees are not damaged during the building of the garden room. Neither tree will actually be touched at all and will be protected adequately during the work. We will comply by the rules and regulation regarding distance from the trees. All material will be brought through the house and not via the narrow passage way at the back of our garden. The garden room will have a maximum height of 2.5m and will not touch any part of the trees. It will comply will distance rules from the tree and neighbours on either side. We have been told that we do not need planning permission for this build. Please see separate sketch plan of position of the trees in the garden.",
