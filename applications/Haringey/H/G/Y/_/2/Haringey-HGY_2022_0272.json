  "description": "London plane (T1) ï¿½ Reduce crown by up to 3m on all aspects. Reduce overlong lateral branch to the north by 5m, to reduce end loading. Reduce overlong lateral branch to the east by 4m, to reduce end loading. Remove epicormic growth up to crown break. This tree has not been maintained. A few years ago a large first order branch/stem snapped out of the tree in high wind, leaving the tree unbalanced. The aim of the work is to rebalance the tree and reduce the overall wind sail of the tree. Current height 18m, final height 15m. Current average spread 17m, final average spread 13m.",
