  "description": "The proposal is listed as permanent, but in the event the site has to be decommissioned the land can easily be returned to its previous condition. These tend to be sited for 10+ years, and for this enhancement we are looking to monitor past 2040 in-line with a national Population Exposure Reduction Target (PERT). This has all been detailed within the land agreement discussions. As stated above we have completed a high number of these installations across the UK under Permitted Development. The installation will not alter the existing operation of the existing land and through the monitoring completed it will be providing a benefit to the wider community through the monitoring results to be obtained. We have liaised with Local Authority  the Environmental Health Team throughout the process of scoping this location, and seek to confirm the location is on public land with the Council's  Planning Department therefore we now lodge this application for Lawful Development Consent.",
