  "description": "Works to tree protected by a TPO.\r\nT1 (in TPO schedule) - Ash. Tree ref 1985 in tree location plan. Works: Repollard to 5-6m to original pollard location. Reason: Tree is currently highly dysfunctional. Significant dieback is evident in mid and upper canopy. Degraded large diameter deadwood is evident on extremities. Has recently shed large diameter deadwood into shrub bed. Numerous bark lesions exist up and down primary branches. Pollard knuckle appears sound. 50%+ bark loss at base with exposed wood having white rot evident - some areas having significantly altered/degraded exposed wood. Very poor associated callusing. Screwdriver pushed in 50mm+ to exposed altered wood - stem diameter is approx 800mm. Rationale for pollard is to control risk to garden occupants and adjacent garages while allowing for retention of tree stem to either regenerate or die and provide local deadwood resource.",
