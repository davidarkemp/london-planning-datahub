These trees are very tall and require reducing by up to 6 meters but to form a uniform height to contain crown and root-spread and to remove any dead, dying or crossing branches, crown lift above footpath to 5 metres. Some signs of sooty bark so this will be a duty of care exercise to manage/maintain the owners' trees.",
