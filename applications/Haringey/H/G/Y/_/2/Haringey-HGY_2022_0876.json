  "description": "Works to tree protected by a TPO\r\nHolm oak (T1) - reduce stems leaning over the garden of number 48 Fortismere Avenue by 5m, reduce remaining crown by 2.5m, remove lowest branch over garden of 46 Fortismere Ave. The tree leans at 20 degrees off vertical, towards 3 neighbour's gardens. There is a bracket fungus at the base of the tree. There is concern that the tree may fail in strong winds. The crown reduction will reduce the load on the base of the tree, while retaining the overall shape and  character of the tree. Current height of the tree 15m.",
