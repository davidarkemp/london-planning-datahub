The tree is a large growing species for its location and should be maintained at approximately its current size by regular pruning to avoid\r\ndamage to adjacent buildings and reduce the likelihood of any future risks. T2 - Plane tree (12m) - reduce crown to previous pruning points, approximately 5m reduction. The proposed pruning is part of ongoing tree management. T3 - Pine tree (11m) - remove deadwood from crown. The pruning is on health and safety grounds.",
