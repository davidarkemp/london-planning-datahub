  "description": "Works to trees protected by a TPO.\r\nRear garden left hand side: \r\nT1 Willow x 1 (Salix spp) This very large Willow tree requires a crown reduction equating to 2m in height and 2 m laterally, back to previous reduction points. Lift of what remains of canopy to 3m.\r\nT3 Scots Pine x 1 (Pinus sylvestris) Remove dead wood and reduce the lowest two lateral limbs by 2m.\r\nT4 Scots Pine x 1 (Pinus sylvestris) This tree is supressed by the neighbouring Pine. The right side of the tree should be\r\nreduced to lessen the weight and achieve the correct balance and reduce the risk of snapouts. Remove deadwood from the canopy.\r\n(All other tree works will be considered under Section 211 Notice CON/2022/0356)",
