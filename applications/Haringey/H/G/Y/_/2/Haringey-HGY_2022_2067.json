  "description": "Works to tree protected by a TPO. \r\nT1: Mature Holm Oak in front garden: Approximately 14.00m. Reduce crown height by approximately 1.50-2.00m back to previous most recent reduction points, whilst ensuring the retention of furnishing growth to preserve ample foliage cover. Reduce lateral and sub-lateral growth of the southern section of the crown by up to 2.50m, reducing over long extraneous branches back into main crown structure. Raise crown to the south side of the crown by approximately 2.00m. Reduce remaining lateral and sub-lateral crown by approximately 1.50-2.00m to clear buildings and balance. Raise crown over the road by 1.50-2.00m. Raise crown over No.13 by 1.50m. Remove dead wood, broken and weak branches. Remove Ivy which is growing above the main crown break in order to prevent further advancement into the main crown, therefore helping to control encroachment, increase light levels and reduce hazard potential, whilst preserving tree health, natural characteristics and aesthetic value.\r\n",
