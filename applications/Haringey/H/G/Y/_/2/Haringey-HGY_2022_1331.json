  "description": "Works to tree protected by a TPO.\r\nGrey Poplar (T1): Following a climbing inspection conducted on 19/05/2022 a significant cavity was identified in a south facing limb at a height of approx.18m at the first main bifurcation of the limb. The tree is around 30m tall. The limb has an approximate diameter of 60cm at this point. The entrance to the cavity is a woodpecker hole that has decayed significantly (around 50% of the total diameter) which includes the majority of the branch collar. There is further inclusive bark located just before the union. This presents a safety concern as the potential for branch failure at this point is extremely high (see attached sketch and photos). Proposal: Reduce this limb back to the union to mitigate the risk of failure and safeguard the ongoing health of the tree, which represents an important amenity feature.",
