  "description": "Works to trees protected by a TPO: \r\nRemove two bay trees, referred to as T1 and T2 on the accompanying arboricultural report and site plan. Reason for removal: the trees outgrowing their location and the nuisances this has caused. The trees take up considerable space and cast significant shade over much of the small garden and the rear windows of the property. Additionally, arisings from the trees block nearby drains causing drainage issues. Replacement of the trees with an appropriate species in a more suitable location, towards the rear of the garden.",
