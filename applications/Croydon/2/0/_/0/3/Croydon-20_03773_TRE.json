  "description": "The works we are applying for are:\rT6 - Oak (TPO Ref T8). \rRemove & replace 1 x Oak\r\rReasons:\r1.\tThe tree is positively implicated in subsidence damage.\r2.\tLevel monitoring confirms seasonal movement in the orientation of this tree. \r3.\tSite investigations further show trespass of Quercus roots below the building and a clay soil in a state of desiccation.\r4.\tWe are advised that superstructure repairs in the event the influence of trees is removed is currently estimated at ?132,000. In the event the influence remains (i.e. permission to remove T6 Oak is refused) then the structural strengthening repair costs would be not less than ?510,000. \r5.\tThis gives a cost difference of not less than ?378,000 if the tree remains.\r6.\tIn the event of a refusal the client will seek compensation under s202(e) for the additional costs incurred.\r7.\tScope exists for a lower water demand replacement species further from the buildings within the estate and the council are invited to condition an appropriate replacement.",
