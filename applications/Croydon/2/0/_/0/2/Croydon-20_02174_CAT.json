  "description": "Hornbeam T1:  Reduce the height by approx. 2.5-3m to approx. 4m from ground level. Reduce the lateral spread of the remaining crown, by 1-1.5m to shape. \rReason for application:  To maintain the hornbeam as a smaller tree, to abate competition with beech tree and mitigate decay in trunk. \rBeech T2:  : Prune back the lower regrowth toward the house, by 1m approx, to previous reduction points, to maintain clearance to the house.\rReason for application:  Maintain clearance to house \rCrab Apple T3:  Remove the large low branch growing toward the neighbour's house. Reduce the lateral spread over he neighbour's garden and\rtoward the road, by 1-1.5m. Thin the crown by 10% by pruning out water shoots.\rReason for application:  To limit spread over the neighbouring property and allow more light through the crown. \rApple T4:  Tree with decayed trunk, to left of house/ deck: Reduce in height by 1m approx, to reduce leverage on trunk. Reduce the low limb growing over the deck by 1m approx. by shortening the leader back to the strong side branches above the deck. Remove the 50mm diameter secondary branch adjacent to the corner post and the 30mm diameter secondary branch toward the house. Reduce the remaining spread of the crown by 1m approx. to shape and balance. Thin the crown by 15% by pruning out water shoots and crossing/ rubbing branches, to give an even density throughout.\rReason for application: To maintain clearance to deck and house and mitigate extensive decay in trunk.\rApple T5:  Left side of house, by decking steps: Reduce the crown by 2.5m in height and approx. 1m in spread, to maintain a more compact crown and give clearance to the roof. Thin the crown by 15% approx, by pruning out water shoots and crossing/rubbing branches, to give an even density throughout.\rReason for application:  Maintain clearance to deck and house \rPrunus Group T6:  5 stems, behind garage: Prune lateral spread to provide a clearance of 50-75cm from the garage roof (Croham Manor CA)",
