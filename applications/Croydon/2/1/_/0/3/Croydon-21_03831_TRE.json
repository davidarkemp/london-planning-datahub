I have not received a reply and the cavity in the tree has gotten worse since I last saw it. I am really worried about it. there is a very large limb which needs to be removed asap also a reduction of the rest of the canopy to re balance the rest of the weight so I would like to give 5 days notice for the proposed works.\r(TPO no. 16, 1999)",
