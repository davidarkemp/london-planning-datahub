I am not sure of TPO number as I could not find the planning application when I searched. \rWe would like to part raise and part lower the grass area in our garden to make it level. As i understand, the original planning permission for our property does not allow any excavation for this area hence my application. \r\rThe trees directly behind our house are small so I would like to get someone to come and have a look to confirm what we can/ can't do.",
