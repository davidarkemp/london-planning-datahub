  "description": "T1 Lime Tree - Reduce six previously reduced branches hanging over Danecroft property by 2 metres back to old pruning points or suitable growth points.  T2 Horse Chestnut - Removal of two lowest large limbs over hanging Danecroft back to main trunk. And reduce any smaller overhanging lateral limbs over property by 3 metres maintaining balance. (Two lowest limbs are heavily weighted and could cause serious damage if not removed. Limiting light. Neighbouring side is very sparse so will balance tree substantially.) T3 Horse Chestnut - Reduce lateral limbs over hanging Danecroft property by 3m (Again heavily one sided over property with branches breaking and landing on roof as seen in photo)\r\rTree (4/5) Horse Chesnuts - Reduce lateral limbs over hanging Danecroft property by 3m (Again one sided with branches breaking and damaging roof)\r\rTree (6) Large Beech - Sectional dismantle large Beech tree over hanging Danecroft but in the garden of Beech House to ground level. (Beech tree had only two live branches last summer, lots of dead wood throughout, left any longer may become a danger to both properties and be more of a risk to climb. We will replant close to where this Beech is removed.\r\rTree (7) Sycamore - Reduce lateral spread overhanging Danecroft property by 1 metre.\r\rTree (8) Sycamore - Reduce lateral spread over hanging Danecroft property by 2m and shape accordingly. Again very one sided so will balance tree\r\rTree (9) Cherry Tree - Reduce/prune medium Cherry all over by 2m maintaining shape, leaving suitable growth points.\r\rTree (10) Sycamore - Reduce lateral overhang from neighbouring side by 3 m, lots of snapped out branches hanging and breaking because of lateral length.\r(TPO no 14, 1976 )",
