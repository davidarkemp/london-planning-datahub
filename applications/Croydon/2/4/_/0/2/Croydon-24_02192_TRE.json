We are asking permission to do a 0.5 meter crown reduction back to the previous pruning points.\rReasons: - No significant trimming of the tree has been conducted since 2015, consequently the tree has grown very close to the house and in addition to the threat of damage from falling branches during wind, it is also blocking significant sunlight to the property. - This trim is not for beautification purposes but rather for safety.\r(TPO no. 104)",
