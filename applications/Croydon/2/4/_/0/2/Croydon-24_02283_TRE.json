This Yew tree is overhanging the car park area preventing residents from parking in the spaces underneath it due to the amount of tree waste (needles and sap) that covers the cars. The tree also reduces the amount of sunlight that comes in to the property. The removal of this tree will not affect the tree line from the road as there is another Yew tree that is situated in front of it.\r(TPO 97)",
