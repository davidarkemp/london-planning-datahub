  "description": "Variation of Condition 3 (materials) attached to PP 25/00670/FUL for the replacement of windows.\r\r Application Reference Number: 25/00670/FUL\tDate of Decision: 20/05/2025\r\rCondition Number(s): 3\r\rConditions(s) Removal:\r\rThis condition is unfair as a polished weld is not a standard option on PVCu products or with suppliers.  It is also unnecessary as the property is not against the Road and this small detail will not be seen or noticed. The sash style windows with all the other details on the condition is enough to preserve the visual amenity of the Conservation Area, this part of the condition is excessive. This additional request has come at a late stage and was never mentioned before during both consultation periods and was added on without discussion at the end. To retain this part of the condition would mean a specialist supplier would be needed and would cost our customer additional money whoever the supplier was. \rNotwithstanding the details shown on the approved drawings the front windows must be the same break dimensions, style, opening method with upward sliding sash designs and run through horns. All windows must maintain the same window reveal as existing.",
