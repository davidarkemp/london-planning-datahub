  "description": "The applicant is seeking to vary Condition 2 of the planning permission to make non-materials amendments to the approved elevations. Specifically the amendments involve:\r1. Introduction of ?hit and miss? brickwork surrounding the staircore extension to create a full enclosure, asrequired by building regulations. \r2. Change to materials of the top floor to a brick slip system. Note this is consistent with the approach previously granted as a non-material amendment to the earlier houses in multiple occupation permission which was approved in August 2018 (ref: 18/02952/NMA).\r3. Alteration to the balustrade on the rear elevation (from glazing to aluminium railings).\r4. Introduction of a lift overrun (which will not be visible from street level).",
