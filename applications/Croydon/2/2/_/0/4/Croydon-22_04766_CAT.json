Customer would like to reduce the thickness of the tree line at the rear of the garden which will also allow the oak (T2) that sits directly behind it to have more sunlight and space to flourish.  (T1) also produces excess shade and leaf waste. \rOak (T6) - Fell. Customer would like to reduce the thickness of the tree line at the rear of the garden which will also allow the oak (T7) that sits directly behind it to have more sunlight and space to flourish.  (T6) also produces excess shade and leaf waste. \rHawthorne (T4) - Fell due to decay approximately 1.5 meters in the main stem from ground level (Picture T4 Showing decay). The tree also has excessive lean and is at risk of failing at this point. (Picture T4 Hawthorne)\rOak (T10) - Fell due to long standing cavity that has penetrated into the main stem (Picture T10 oak cavity). There is a risk of failure in high winds.\rOak (T9 - Fell due to customer looking to install solar panels on the roof. The oak produces excessive shade in the roof area where this will be installed. The tree also produces excess shade and leaf waste on the driveway.\rOak (T8) - To perform overall crown reduction by 1.5 - 2 meters. To perform crown lift up to where the main stem splits. (Approx 5 meters)",
