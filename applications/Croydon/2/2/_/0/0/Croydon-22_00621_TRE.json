All works are carried out to BS 3998: 2010 Tree work recommendations. A well balanced shape must be maintained. As these trees are covered by TPO, an application will be carried out by Expertrees prior to the work taking place.

All branches will be pruned to appropriate growth points. All works are carried out to BS 3998: 2010 Tree work recommendations. A well balanced shape must be maintained. As these trees are covered by TPO, an application will be carried out by Expertrees prior to the work taking place. To allow more light onto the decking area.\rT3 - Ash - To reduce lowest overhanging limb from mature neighbouring Ash tree by 3.0m to reduce the encroachment over the garden. All branches will be pruned to appropriate growth points. All works are carried out to BS 3998: 2010 Tree work recommendations. A well balanced shape must be maintained. The branch is overextended and needs a weight reduction.\rT4 - Pine - Cost to reduce 1x overlong limb on mature neighbouring Pine tree so that it doesn't protrude the remaining crown (approx. 1.5m).",
