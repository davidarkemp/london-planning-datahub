  "description": "1 x oak tree (T522): Reduce low lateral branches on the south side of the crown by 1.5-2m, to a height of 4m from ground level to provide clearance for high-sided vehicles entering Grosvenor Square via the proposed delivery route. Reduce low lateral branches on the west side of the crown by 1.5-2m to balance the crown. All cuts to be made to suitable branch junctions in order to maintain a flowing canopy outline.  No pruning is proposed on the north and east sides of the crown. The existing crown dimensions are approximately 8m north, 7m east, 9m south, and 9.5m west.\r1 x London plane (T528): Prune 4 no. roots that have diameters that do not exceed 30mm in the locations identified by the green circle with red outline on the accompanying sketch plan, to facilitate the subsequent installation of screw piles.\r\r",
