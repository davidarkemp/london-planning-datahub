Family and Children's Growing Garden. We were advised that the main allotment site wasn't challenged as it was recognised that the allotments provided an alternative environmental benefit for the local community. We are hoping that the 'Meanwhile' nature of the proposed development will allow the planning authority to grant consent for this change of to an area of public open space. Please note: The proposed development site sits entirely within an already fenced area.\n\n",
