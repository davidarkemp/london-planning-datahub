  "description": "High level stabilization and repair of the plaster to Bays 1 to 24 and 30 of the Auditorium plaster ceilings and gallery.\r\rAs a result of the successful completion of a number of inspection and investigation surveys of the high level plaster within the auditorium, this Listed Building Consent application seeks consent for what will now entail the stabilization and repair of the plaster to Bays 1 to 24 and 30. The proposed scope and methodology of repairs described within this application have been developed with a plaster specialist, the structural engineer, the client and the conservation architects, Feilden+Mawson to achieve the aim of securing the long term stability of the Hall in an otherwise remote and inaccessible location. The work will take advantage of the purpose designed access cradle erected in 2024 that has been used by the appointed plaster specialist consultant and contractors to closely examine and report on each area. The work forms part of the responsible approach the Hall takes to secure the future maintenance and long term safety of its Grade I listed home.\rThe repairs recommended within this application seek to address those defects identified, using appropriate materials and techniques which balance conservation-based repairs with compatibility and functionality.",
