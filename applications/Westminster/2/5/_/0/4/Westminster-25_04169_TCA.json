  "description": "T1: Wych Elm (pendula)- Crown lift the low canopy to 1.8m above ground level. Tip lifting through pruning of small diameter tertiary growth only (under 1.5cm diameter).\r\rT2: Ginkgo Biloba- Crown lift the low canopy to 2m above ground level. Tip lifting through pruning of small diameter tertiary growth only. Prune away from the building by generally around 1m to ensure 1m minimum clearance. Minor pruning of small growth to ensure 0.5m clearance to overhead wires. \r\rT3: Oak-  Reduce the upper canopy by generally 1.5m but up to 2m where necessary, to reduce the weight and sail of the upper canopy and reduce the forces acting on the stem at the point of failure. In the reduction works upright and north heading growth should be retained where possible. Minor, selective reduction of the mid canopy only, reducing up to 1m to avoid wind exposure of mid canopy branches. The lower canopy is not to be reduced, just minor lifting. Crown lift the low canopy to 2m above ground level. Tip lifting through pruning of small diameter tertiary growth only.\r\r(inspection notes T3- Recent failure of a section, considered due to a tight bifurcated union with bark inclusion. Failed union at approximately 6m agl. N section failed leaving an asymmetrical upper canopy, biased to the S. Failure has resulted in loss of approximately 30- 40 percent of the stem material. The remaining upper canopy is relatively sparse however, meaning wind loading is reduced).\r\rT4: Birch- Crown lift the low canopy to 1.8m above ground level. Tip lifting through pruning of small diameter growth only.",
