  "description": "T1 ? Tree of Heaven ? Fell to ground level using full sectional dismantling with a rigging system to safely lower all material and prevent further damage. Stump to be treated following removal.\rReason for works: The tree is contributing to significant subsidence at the property, with the situation expected to worsen if not addressed. Removal of T1 is essential to minimalise the exacerbation of property damages.\r\rT1 is Ailanthus. T1 has close proximity to the damages found within property number 2. The property is situated on a London Clay belt. Fibrous roots have been found emanating from the areas of damaged areas of property 2. It has been published that there is a strong association between property damages and the presence of Ailanthus where damages have been recorded (that is not to say that damages foreseeable for every Ailanthus, just that where damages have been recorded and an Ailanthus is present damages can often be attributed to the tree).",
