  "description": "T1 - Sycamore. Tip back / reduce the crown on its northeast aspect over the PH garden to the established reduction points, examples of which are identified in the supporting photographs. The work is required to reduce detritus accumulating in the garden and to shorten perching spots, thereby reducing the accumulation of pigeon faeces on the patio and garden furniture. Given it's only proposed to tip back to the established pruning points on the crown's northeast aspect, it's considered the works will have a negligible impact on the tree's longevity.\r\rT2 - False Acacia. Fell. This specimen is located in proximity to the boundary wall and one of its codominant stems is starting to encase the adjacent buttress. There is evidence of an included union on the stem?s southwest aspect that is compromising its structural integrity. Dense epicormic growth is also present throughout its entire crown, which is generally associated with a stress response. Given the defects present, it is not considered a suitable specimen to become the subject of a TPO. The defects are shown in the supporting photographs.",
