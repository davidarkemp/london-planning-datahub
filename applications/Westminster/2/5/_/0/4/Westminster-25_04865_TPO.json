  "description": "T1 London Plane (Platanus ? hispanica)\rProposed works:\rReduce overall height and lateral spread by up to 3 metres in order to maintain the tree at a suitable size for its location and to manage long-term crown development.\r\rJustification:\rThis forms part of a routine crown management regime, in accordance with BS3998:2010, aimed at maintaining safe clearance from surrounding structures and managing mechanical loading on lateral limbs. The tree has responded well to previous reductions and is due for cyclical maintenance to retain form, health and amenity value.\r\rT2 & T3 Common Lime (Tilia ? europaea)\rProposed works:\rReduce overall height and lateral spread by up to 3 metres to maintain crown size, balance and structure.\r\rJustification:\rRoutine cyclical crown reduction to contain the tree within the existing management envelope, promote a compact crown form, and reduce wind loading on extended limbs. This is in line with BS3998:2010 recommendations and maintains the trees in good physiological and structural condition while preserving amenity.",
