The secondary\rbranches growing from the limb should be lightly pruned by up to 1.5 m to balance the shape of the crown an produce a natural aesthetic.\r\rT4529 London Plane\rReduce faulted stem / stems by - Specified extent (stem to the southeast which has 2 obvious woodpecker holes at approximately 8\rm and several decayed pruning wounds throughout. Stem previously weight reduced but now regrown). Re-reduce stem by around 2.5 m to\rthe most recent, previous pruning points to minimise loading on weakened stem. Additionally, reduce the two heavily leaning stems to the\rnortheast overhanging the children's playground, by around 2.5 m, due to heavy extension growth observed and to prevent failure due to a\rchange in the crown/ wind dynamics, following the reduction of the southeast stem. Final cuts to be no greater than 100 mm diameter, leaving\rfurnishing growth to minimise visual impact\r",
