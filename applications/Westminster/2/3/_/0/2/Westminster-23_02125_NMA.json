  "description": "Amendments to planning permission dated 27 March 2019 (RN: 17/02394/FULL) for alterations and extensions, including demolition and reconstruction of rear extensions, excavation of basement floor, removal of tree, alterations to front boundary wall, installation of mechanical plant, erection of cupola at roof level, use of part of garden to rear of No.8 Ordnance Hill, and internal works to all floor levels in connection with the use of the building as five residential apartments (2x3 bed, 2x2 bed, and 1x1 bed flats). Namely, the omission of swimming pool from lower ground floor, with space being used as a games room and living area, resulting in reduction in overall basement excavation; reduction in the amount of excavation towards the front of the building, meaning that the front wall of the chapel would no longer need to be underpinned; Alterations to the internal layout of accomodation, including omission of duplex flat layout with internal staircase and instead arranging the accommodation as self contained flats on each floor.",
