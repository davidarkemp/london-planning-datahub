The trees are growing in a small space with risk of there not being enough room for sufficient root growth and stability. A neighbouring tree has already failed and nearly hit the property and residents. Our client is therefore very keen to reduce the risk these trees could pose. Please refer also to structural engineer's report - attached to application - this points to structural damage caused by the trees.",
