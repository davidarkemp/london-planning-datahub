  "description": "It has been discovered upon aerial inspection that T13 contains a large vertical cavity spanning the depth of the trunk, the depth has been measured at 3.8m using a throw line, this is almost the full depth of its trunk. \r\rThe approved scope of works on this item are: \rT13: Lime: crown reduce to previous, most recent reduction points, retaining shortened furnishing growth and approx.. 50% of fine branch structure throughout the crown.  Remove basal growth.\r\rWe believe that this tree poses considerable risk given the identified cavity and would like to propose an ammendment to fell and remove T13 to mitigate future risk.",
