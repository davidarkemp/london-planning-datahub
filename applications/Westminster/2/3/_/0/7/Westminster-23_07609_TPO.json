  "description": "T1 - Lime - Located in rear garden - Would like to Fell.\rReason - Tree has large cavity from base to 2m. There appears to be approx 1/3 holding wood. When sound tested holding wood and around area there is a different change in tone which would indicate it is hollow. Placing a spike upwards in cavity the decay continues for 600mm. This is as far as able to reach, this could extend further. Due to the close proximity to property its a high risk location which is why we would recommend removal. Please see attached photos.",
