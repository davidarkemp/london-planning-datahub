Prunus laurocerasus) - LOCATION: 10 Queen's Grove: Laterally cut back all overhanging crown elements back to the boundary line that separates the site (i.e., St Johns Wood Barracks) from the adjacent rear garden within which these 3no. laurels are located.\r\r(Works to T13, G14, T15, T16, G100, and T101 are to facilitate the erection of a scaffold framework with Monarflex type sheeting around the riding school to facilitate repair works. Works to T18 and T19 are to facilitate the construction of a new boundary treatment that requires a greater clearance from ground level than the trees currently have.\r\rPlease see the specific description fot each tree proposal within the application form attached.)",
