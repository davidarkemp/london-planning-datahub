Namely, to allow amendments including clear, floor-to-ceiling, fire-resistant curtain walling instead of individual window units; an alternative means of escape from the 4th and 5th floors on to the existing fire escape stair at 112 Jermyn Street; and the balustrade to the parapet to be an open railing rather than clear glazed toughened glass.",
