  "description": "Notice under s.211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 of intent to \rFell and treat T1 Whitebeam (Swedish) at 45 Chepstow Road, London W2 5BP\r\rWe write in reference to our site survey of 10th October 2019 and confirm that we are the arboriculturists appointed on behalf of property insurers of the above risk address.\r\rIt is the view of chartered engineers appointed to investigate damage that the property has suffered differential movement and subsequent damage consistent with tree related clay shrinkage subsidence. \r\rFurther to discussions with the Structural Engineer who is assessing the required remedial works for the property, we are of the opinion that it is preferable to remove the implicated trees. This is because retaining the trees and implementing an engineered solution cannot happen without having serious effect on their root systems which are influencing the structure of the risk address.\r\rThis submission consists of a formal notification under Conservation Area Regulations of our intention to remove the trees as mentioned above which we believe are not protected under any Tree Preservation Order.\r\rWhilst insurers have no requirement to submit prescribed levels of supporting evidence in relation to a Conservation Area notification we are enclosing copies of relevant technical reports, in the attached Appendices, as itemised below:\r\r1.\tA site plan, survey tables and photographs which locates vegetation that is the subject of this notification.\r2.\tEngineering Reports dated 29th November 2018 and 28th March 2019\r3.\tGeotechnical Soil Analysis Report dated 8th April 2019\r4.\tSite investigation report dated 28th March 2019\r\rWe have demonstrated, from the evidence detailed above, two tests in line with current case law that show:\r\r1.\tTree roots were present underside of foundations:\r.\tPositive Pomoideae root ID \r\r2.\tDamage to the insured's property has resulted from tree related subsidence:\r.\tHistory and timing of damage indicates it is tree...",
