  "description": "T1- Common Lime\rPreviously pollarded and maintained as such. \rLarge dead trunk on the Southern side of the crown.\rThe union of the two smaller trunks extending over the footpath, parking bays and road appears decayed from the ground. There is a crack forming in this union and given the larger trunk adjacent has died, some remedial action is required to preempt any limb failures. \rSuggested works are to selectively reduce and thin each previous pruning point out (Approximately 3-4m from branch tips) so as to retain one or two leaders to grow and form a new and more natural crown over the next few pruning cycles and to move away from the previous harder reduction practices. \rThin crown by 20-30% ensuring an even density and distribution of finer internal growth. Remove any large diameter dead branches.\rReduce or remove either or both of the smaller Westerly trunks depending on the structural integrity of the attachment points.",
