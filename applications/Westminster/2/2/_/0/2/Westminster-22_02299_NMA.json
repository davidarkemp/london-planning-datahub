  "description": "Amendments to planning permission dated 27 October 2021 (ref. 20/05884/FULL) for 'Partial demolition and remodelling of the principal facades and fifth floor and addition of two storeys for office use and provision of retail, restaurant and gym uses at ground and basement levels.  Formation of terraces on sixth and seventh floors for office use and associated plant and cycle parking'. \rNamely, Due to structural concerns of the condition / stability of existing brick parapet to the East, North and West retained elevations, we are proposing to demolish the existing brick parapet and coping, and rebuild with new brickwork to match existing. Imperial brickwork and natural mortar will be provided to match the existing East, North and West elevations, with a new concrete coping provided to replace and repair the poor condition concrete copings. No change to existing parapet levels / datums are proposed.",
