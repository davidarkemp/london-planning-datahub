  "description": "1 x Himalayan birch: root pruning of one structural surface root with a diameter of approximately 6cm, pruning back to about 10cm inside the proposed line of the planting bed (approx. 20-30cm from the tree trunk), root pruning to remove three small structural surface roots with diameters of 1-2cm, and pruning of any small fibrous roots which are growing in the zone between the sand layer and the removed block paving.  All cuts to be made with a  sharp pruning implement, pruning back to suitable side roots where possible and pruning at right angles to the root in order to ensure that the pruning wound is round (not oval) and is as small as possible.",
