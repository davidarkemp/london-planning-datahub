  "description": "T1 is a mature purple leaved plum Prunus cerasifera Nigra. It is approximately 9.5 metres tall, with a stem diameter of 220mm measured at b1.5 metres above ground level. The main stem leans heavily to the east. The tree has grown naturally this way due to the over shadowing canopy of T2. The base of T1 is sound, with no damage to exposed buttress roots. Some epicormic growth has been pruned from the base of the tree, resulting in minor stubs.\r\rT2 is a semimature common ash Fraxinus excelsior. It is approximately 14.4 metres tall, with a stem diameter of 440mm measured at 1.5 metres above ground level. Buttress roots at the base of the tree are sound with no physical damage. The main stem bifurcates at approximately 3 metres above ground level. The union of co-dominant stems here is well formed with no visible bark inclusion.",
