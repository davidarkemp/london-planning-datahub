  "description": "Amendments to planning permission 18th December 2020 (RN: 20/02247/FULL) Use of the building as a private members' club (sui generis) comprising office space and bedroom accommodation with ancillary functions and a publicly accessible restaurant / bar (sui generis) at part ground and basement levels. Erection of a new sixth floor and creation of terraces at rear first, fourth, fifth and new sixth floor level. Installation of plant with associated screening at sixth floor level and alterations to the elevations to include the installation of new shopfronts on the Brewer Street and Warwick Street elevations. Namely, the application seeks to remove the hotel use from the scheme, and replace this with additional office floorspace consistent with the consented use of the building at lower levels.",
