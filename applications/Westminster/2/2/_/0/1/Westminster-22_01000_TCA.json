  "description": "All plane trees highlighted in red on the supplied map.\rThe Portman Estate has expressed a concern that the garden as a whole is too shaded by the London Plane trees and that they would be keen to undertake some pruning to remedy this. The plane trees all have long, low pendulous growth over the perimeter of the square (over the road) as well as within the square. We would like crown lift the trees to 7-8 meters up to crown break to have a less dense lower canopy. We would also like to selectively thin the trees by 25% to allow more light into the square as a whole. It has been noticed that the grass in the square is suffering due to the lack of light and sensitive thinning of the canopies would increase sun light levels",
