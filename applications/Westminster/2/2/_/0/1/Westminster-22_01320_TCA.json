  "description": "Reduce the height of 7 x London Planes (T1 - T7) to 16m.  The existing height of these trees are between 18-20m.\rMy Client MBNL, a joint venture between EE and Three, are responsible for providing the infrastructure for the new Emergency Services Network and will be\rutilising their existing sites in order to build this Network. Details of their commitment to this project can be found at the following link:\rhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-emergency-services-mobile-communications-programme/emergency-services-network#ee-coverage. MBNL\rtechnicians have identified that these trees are causing an obstruction to their equipment and thereby affecting the coverage within the local area. The\rproposed reduction to these trees will restore full coverage to the network and ensure an efficient switch over from the current supplier of the Emergency\rServices Network (Airwave) to EE.",
