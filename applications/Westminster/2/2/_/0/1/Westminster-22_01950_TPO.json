  "description": "Sycamore (T1): Reduce height by approximately 5-6m (see annotated photo). Mature sycamore has been maintained on a cyclical pruning regime but after inspection, a major cavity has been identified in the basal zone that extends transversely across more than 60% of the circumference and upward into the main stem as far as our 600mm probe could reach. A significant reduction in height will minimise lever arm effect on the main stem and extend what little remains of the life of the tree which can be managed at a lower height.",
