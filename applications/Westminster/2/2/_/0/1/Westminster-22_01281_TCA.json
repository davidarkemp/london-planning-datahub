  "description": "1 x London plane (rear): Carryout climbed inspection for Massaria (Splanchnonema platani); remove diseased branches that are below 50mm in diameter and remove deadwood. Reduce crown on north and west sides (not height and other sides) by thinning up to 20% of branches at the ends of previous most recent reduction points, concentrating on removing the largest regrowth and then reducing remaining branches to no more than the previous most recent reduction points and retaining shortened furnishing growth of about 1m long so that the overall crown is balanced. The epicormic growth on the main scaffold limbs and laterals shall be retained to provide a source of photosynthesis and also to be encouraged for future points crown reduction.",
