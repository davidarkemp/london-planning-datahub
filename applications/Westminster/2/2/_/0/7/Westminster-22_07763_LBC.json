  "description": "Alterations to implement damp proofing and water management system throughout the lower ground level of the property, removing existing defective waterproofing renders, membranes, and installing a combination between a drained cavity membrane system with pumped drainage system, lined with a breathable wood fibre insulation to the retaining walls, and a damp-proofing membrane system with lath mesh layers elsewhere - all to be finished in lime plaster. The proposal includes the replacement of the existing ground concrete slab to address existing waterproofing issued within the existing, as well as to accommodate the installation of any new services.",
