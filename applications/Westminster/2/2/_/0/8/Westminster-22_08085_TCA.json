  "description": "Holly T1 - fell to ground level and replace as per landscape plan.\rZelkova T3 - translocate to location along boundary wall indicated on landscape plan.\r\rBoth operations to be carried out to improve landscaping within rear garden as well as provide more useable areas of the garden and improve screening.  \r\rAs the enclosed Photographic Record shows, neither tree is thriving within the rear garden and nor are the previously unrecorded silver birch and holly adjacent to T7 previously discussed by Officers. Replacing the holly and translocating the zelkova will result in 2 specimens growing in a planting medium far more suitable than the current. \r\rBoth trees also artificially foreshorten the rear garden and provide only limited screening in their current locations.  Removal / translocation will also imncrease the useable garden area and provide more meaningful screening into and out of the property.",
