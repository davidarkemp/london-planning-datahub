The wall is in very poor condition with historic and more recent damage evident. My client would like to proceed with removal of these four trees in order to undertake robust remedial work to secure the wall and to prevent continued damage to the wall.  The wall is within close proximity to a footpath in the garden of Abbey Court and adjoins a car park on its South side and so represents considerable risk to life and property on both sides of the boundary. \r\rA report by a structural engineer, dated 13/09/24, concludes the following:\r'Several cracks have evidently been repaired and have continued to move.\rA large section of the wall has been rebuilt above the neighbour's higher ground level, and it appears continuing\rmovement in the lower retaining section has caused the wall to bulge rather than lean over part of its length.\rSome of the movement appears to have been caused by vehicle impact in the past. However, there is further\rsignificant cracking away from these areas, which we would attribute to ongoing ground movement caused by the\rtrees.\rGiven the clay subsoils and proximity of the trees to the retaining wall, even assuming low shrinkability clay, the\rtrees would be influencing the clay up to 2.2m below ground level. This seasonal movement in the retaining wall is\rcausing progressive movement out of plane. Ultimately this will lead to collapse.\rWe would recommend that the mature Sycamore and Lime trees are removed in order to allow robust remedial\rworks to be carried out to the wall. We would also recommend the\r",
