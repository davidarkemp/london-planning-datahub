  "description": "Display of non illuminated hoarding sign measuring 6.35m X 15.15m for a temporary period.\r\r\rThe proposed advertisement is for a large-format scaffold wrap designed to cover the scaffolding on the exterior of the building at 125 New Bond St, London W1S 1DY, extending from the first floor to the fourth floor with a total height of 1515mm. The wrap will be constructed using PVC printed canvas, securely attached with cable ties, bungee cords, and ratchet straps. The structure supporting the wrap will consist of 12mm exterior-grade timber, treated with a water-resistant varnish and a high-quality paint finish. The wrap edges will be reinforced with 20mm angle plastic corners. This wrap will serve both aesthetic and practical purposes, including site branding, concealment of ongoing construction work, and protection of the public from construction debris, contributing to a more visually appealing streetscape during the construction period.",
