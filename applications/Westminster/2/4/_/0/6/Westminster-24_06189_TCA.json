  "description": "T2 - Cherry - prune lateral branches growing into adjacent tree by up to 1m to provide clearance from adjacent tree\rG1 Hornbeam x 4: Crown reduce easternmost (tallest tree) by up to 4m, and reduce heights of remaining trees to match (approx. 2m).  Reduce overlong lateral growth on trees at east and west ends of the row by up to 2m, and reduce lateral growth on south side of group by up to 1m.  Reduce lateral growth on north side of the row up to 1m  south of the tennis court boundary fence.  Crown lift up to 4m through the removal of secondary branches, ensuring that the diameter of the secondary branches does not exceed one third of the diameter of the parent branch.  Remove selected lower branches (maximum diameter 12cm) back to the main trunk.  Remove one larger diameter secondary branch on the easternmost tree. \rEnsure that finer diameter branches (up to 5cm) are lifted to give 1.5m clearance from structures.  All pruning back to suitable growth points, shaping to a natural flowing canopy outline. \rT3 - Eucalyptus - Fell\r2 x Eucalyptus (smaller trees adjacent to T3): fell\r1 x weeping willow: prune back from adjacent Catalpa by up to 1m. \r1 x London plane (by main house entrance): crown lift low, pendulous branches by 2-3m\r1 x sycamore (declining specimen on boundary with Regent's Park): fell\r",
