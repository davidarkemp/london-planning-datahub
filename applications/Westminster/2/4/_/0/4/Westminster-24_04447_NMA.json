NAMELY, to introduce an additional condition, identified as No.45,  to introduce phasing into the permission so the proposed implementation works can be carried out without triggering pre-commencement planning conditions, planning obligations and CIL liability. Also seeks to amend pre-commencement conditions 4,5,6 and 44 to refer to phase 1 as defined in the new phasing condition, so that these 4  conditions would not need to be discharged prior to the commencement",
