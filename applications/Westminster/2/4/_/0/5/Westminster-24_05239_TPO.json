  "description": "T4617 - Platanus x hispanica (London Plane):\rFLG - Fell ground level - to facilitate an increase in biodiversity within Belgrave Square by way of the selection of a species of lower local representation, and to reduce the ongoing costs of maintenance to T4617 following a recent decay detection report which details a significant increase in the decay present. A replacement will allow for an improved aesthetic of the garden square providing an increase in the species diversity and remove the continual requirement for costly decay detection and tree stability testing.\rPNT - Plant replacement tree - (from this selection) Liriodendron tulipifera/ Fagus sylvatica ???Purpurea???/ Quercus x turnerii Pseudoterneri. During the first planting season (September - April) following tree removal.",
