Namely, to allow removal of southwestern sector with the other two sectors being reorientated to compensate for the removal; relocation of 2no. dishes onto a free-standing frame on the southeastern side of the roof; reduction of the number of cabinets from 8no. to 4no. with the cabinets on the southwestern side of the roof removed; and overall reduction in the amount of steelwork and the overall height of the antennas by 2.85 metres (from 29.75 metres to 26.9 metres).",
