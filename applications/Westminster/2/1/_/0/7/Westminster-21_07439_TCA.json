Suggested work: - reduce the height by 2-3m - reduce the lateral growth by 1-2m rear garden T3 Lime x 1 (Tilia spp) This large multi-stemmed lime has notbeen pruned in several years and is covered in thick ivy. We suggest this tree needs to be reduced and reshaped. Suggested work: - reduce height by 4m - reduce the lateral growth by 3m rear garden T4 Unknown x 1 This stone-dead tree is leaning heavily and needs to be felled to ground level rear garden T5 Lime x 1 (Tilia spp) This large lime has outgrown its location. Suggested work: - reduce height by 3m - reduce the lateral growth by 2m and reshape - remove ivy",
