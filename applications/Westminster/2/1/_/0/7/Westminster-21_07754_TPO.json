  "description": "Statement of Reasons for Tree Preservation Order Application to\rFell and Treat Stump to T4 Tree of Heaven 48 Blomfield Road, London, W9 2PD.\r\rPlease read this as part of a dual submission alongside application fell and treat T5 and T6 Lime trees located at 49 Blomfield Road, London, W9 2PD.\r\r1.\tThe above tree works are proposed as a remedy to the differential foundation movement at the insured property and to ensure the long-term stability of the building.\r\r2.\tThe above tree works are proposed to limit the extent and need for expensive and disruptive engineering repair works at the insured property. In this instance the estimated repair costs are likely to vary between ?10,000 and ?60,000 depending upon whether the tree/s can be removed or must remain.  \r\r3.\tThe above tree works are proposed to limit the duration of any claim period and therefore allow the landowner their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property.\r\r4.\tIt is the case that an alternative to felling such as pruning or significant 'pollarding' of the tree would not provide a reliable or sustainable remedy to the subsidence in this case. We do not consider that any other potential means of mitigation, including root barriers, would be effective or appropriate in the circumstances.\r\r5.\tWe are satisfied that the evidence obtained following completion of our Arboricultural Implication Assessment report completed 2nd April 2020, clearly links the implicated trees as the cause of damage to the risk address\r\r6.\tInsurers understanding the requirement to offer replacement planting in the event consent to fell is granted.",
