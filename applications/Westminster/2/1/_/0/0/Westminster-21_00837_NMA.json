  "description": "Amendments to planning permission dated 27 November 2017 (RN: 17/02957/FULL) for Variation of Conditions 1 and 6 of planning permission dated 2 March 2017 (RN 15/10671/FULL) for the demolition and redevelopment of 117 to 125 Bayswater Road, together with 2 to 6 Queensway and 7 Fosbury Mews for a new building comprising 3 basements, ground and 9 upper storeys to include 55 residential units and ancillary residential facilities (class C3), together with retail (class A1) unit, a retail (class A1) and/or restaurant (class A3) unit, a dentist (class D1) and a spa use (class D2), highway works and the use of car parking within the basement of Consort House. Namely, to vary the approved drawings to amend the ground floor frontage to allow the existing bureau de change to remain in situ and be part of the scheme temporarily and to extend the spa over all three basement levels rather than two, NAMELY to amend wording of condition 24 in order to allow sufficient time for officers to review the sample panel so that the trigger for details to be approved is amended to refer to the construction of the external envelope. Revised wording of condition 24 to require approval of fabricated sample panel before work on the external envelope of the building rather than the super structure.",
