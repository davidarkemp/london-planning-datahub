  "description": "Front Garden:\rT1:  Magnolia Grandiflora:\rThin crown density by approximately 20%.  Reduce crown all round by approximately 1.00m.  Reduce roosting branches overhanging the main entrance gate by approximately 1.50-2.00m. \rReasons:  Pigeons are using the tree for roosting and large amounts of droppings are causing the front gate and path to be unsanitary.  Our client has asked for a flying Falcon bird scarer to be installed to help abate further nuisance.\r\rT2:  Acer - (side of the building):\rThin crown density by 20%.  Prune back to clear building by 1.50m.\rReason:  General maintenance to control encroachment.\r\rT3:  Quince: \rRaise crown over the pavement by 0.50m.  Reduce back over the road by approximately 1.00m.\rReason:  General maintenance to control encroachment on to the carriageway.",
