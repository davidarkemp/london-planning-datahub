  "description": "1 x magnolia (T1): Prune branches overhanging adjacent walls (east and south) to give 0.5m clearance from the walls; pruning wounds no greater than 3cm in diameter. Prune lowest branches on west side as marked on the attached photograph to give 3m clearance from ground level beyond the pruned branch ends. Prune the rest of the canopy to give 3m clearance by shortening secondary drooping branches as required. Crown thin water shoots by 30%.\r1 x crab apple (T2): reduce crown by about 1.5m; to suitable growth points so that furnishing growth is maintained, reduce lateral branch that extends south over the adjacent wall by about 2.5m back to the previous, most recent reduction point. Crown lift to give 3m clearance by shortening drooping branches. Remove dead wood.",
