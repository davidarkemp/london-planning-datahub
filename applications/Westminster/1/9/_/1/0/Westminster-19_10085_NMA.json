Namely, to vary the approved drawings to amend the ground floor frontage to allow the existing bureau de change to remain in situ and be part of the scheme temporarily and to extend the spa over all three basement levels rather than two.  NAMELY, reconfiguration of the layouts of levels 8 and 9, the removal of the BMU at level 9 and the relocation of the roof level plant to basement level. The changes result in the size of the 3 units changing from four bed units to 2x5 bed units and 1x6 bed unit. The overall number of units will remain unchanged.  \r The amendments result in a minor external alteration to the ninth floor of the building at the rear through the removal of the plant area and in-fill to complete the elevation.",
