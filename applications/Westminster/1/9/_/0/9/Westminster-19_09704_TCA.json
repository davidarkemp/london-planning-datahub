  "description": "The tree is a pear tree.\rIt is identified as \"T2\" on the arboricultural report attached with this application (page 8 of the pdf for a site plan, page 9 for photo).\rThe recommendation from this report is to remove (fell) to near ground level and treat stump to inhibit regrowth - please see page 6 of the pdf report for this.\r\rThe reason for the removal (felling) of the tree is due to subsidence and damage create to the building.\r\rThe report was completed by Crawford & Company, as a result of subsidence claim for the block at 28-30 Sutherland Avenue W9 2HQ which is part of the same freehold. The Directors of the freehold were required to commission the report, as a result of subsidence on the block, and a related insurance claim.\rThe Directors of the freehold of 28-30 Sutherland Avenue require the recommendation to remove the tree to be complied with, otherwise this can lead to liability in relation to subsidence, and it may also lead to the building insurance to become void for the block 28-30 Sutherland Avenue, with financial and legal implications for the Directors of the freehold.",
