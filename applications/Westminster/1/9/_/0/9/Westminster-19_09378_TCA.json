  "description": "T1 Whitebeam - Remove - Old specimen for the species that grows in a raised bed which it has damaged to the south and east. Trunk incline towards the west. Main crown framework arises between 1.3 & 2.3 metres with a number of congested / potentially weak unions. Pruning wound with an associated pocket of decay noted to the south east at 1.5 metres. Several large diameter dead stems and upper crown dieback in central area indicate a decline in vigour. Previously reduced.\rT2 Sorbus - Remove - In a state of serious decline with extensive areas of dead and diseased bark - particularly to the north west and south east. Crown framework arises at 2.75 metres with three large stems on south side having been removed - with associated columns of disease below. Extensive areas of trunk covered with fungal fruiting bodies (silver leaf disease). Dominant stem to the east has extensive dieback with limited growth on the south side and further fungal fruiting bodies attached.",
