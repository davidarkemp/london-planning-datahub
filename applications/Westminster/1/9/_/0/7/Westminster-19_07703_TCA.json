Reduce length of one limb projecting over access road by up to 2 m. \r2 x walnuts (T38, T39): Crown lift above curved access road only to 4 m from ground level by removal of selected low branches of 5cm diameter or less, and by reduction of larger diameter low branches by up to 1 m to suitable branch junctions.
