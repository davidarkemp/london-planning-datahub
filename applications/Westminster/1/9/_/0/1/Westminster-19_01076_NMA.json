  "description": "Amendments to planning permission dated 22 December 2016 (RN: 15/06446) for: Excavation of sub-basement, redevelopment of Nos. 5-6 Yarmouth Place, alterations and extension to provide enlarged sixth and new seventh floor storeys and installation of plant at basement, ground and fourth floor levels. Use of extended and altered building as 36 x flats (Class C3) (an additional 28 above existing), car / cycle parking and a shop (Class A1) or financial and professional institution (Class A2) at part ground floor level. Internal alterations. (SITE COMPRISES 96-100 PICCADILLY AND 5-6 YARMOUTH PLACE).  Namely, to enable the variation of the wording of Condition 41 to remove the pre-commencement requirement. Revised condition 41 wording: You must apply to us for approval of details of how the flats will be insulated to reduce noise passing between them.  You must not start work on the relevant part of the development until we have approved in writing what you have sent us. You must then carry out the work according to the approved details before anyone moves into the flats.",
