  "description": "Proposal: 1 x Sweet Chestnut Tree, marked T1 on sketch plan. Tree needs reducing in size overall as it has become too big for its environment (small garden).\rProposal - Raise the crown by 1.5 metres. Reduce the height of the crown by 2 meters and reduce the width of the crown by 2 metres, leaving a canopy spread of approximately 5 metres and crown height of around 7m. \rCrown thinning proportionately to keep tree's shape and for it's own health.\r\r1 x Plum Tree, marked T3 on sketch plan. Tree is overgrown and has a climbing plant growing all over one side. It has a fungal infection on some branches.\rProposal - Reduce crown height by 2 metres leaving a crown height of approximately 4 metres.  Remove climber, remove deadwood and infected branches and treat to hopefully halt further infection. Thin the crown proportionately, removing crossed branches",
