  "description": "Location: Rear Garden and clockwise from Shrub bed. \r2. Cherry Crown reduce by 1m, current height 5m, remaining height 4m,  reduce crown spread by 1m, current crown spread 4m, remaining crown spread 3m. \r5. Crab Apple Crown reduce by 1m, current height 5m, remaining height 4m,  reduce crown spread by 1m, current crown spread 4m, \rremaining  crown spread 3m. \r7. Cedar An Inspection of the Cedar has shown several broken Rear of 5 Strawberry Hill Road  and hanging branches, demonstrating the potential for this species in its present condition, is to have branch failure. Two low branches with a diameter of 6 inches that are over\rhanging garden of 7, have overextended from crown line, with a risk of failure, therefore I suggest as follows: Reduce back two low overextended branches growing over garden of 7 by 2.5m to suitable growth points. The current length of these branches is 8m and after pruning works will will be approx. 6m.",
