  "description": "The tree (Tree A) is a Cordyline australis, we believe. It is located within a metre of our house, and has caused extensive damage to drains which run beneath it. These drains run into neighbouring properties, so has caused considerable damage / many issues for the previous owner / us and our neighbours. The drains have been patched but are still being impacted as the tree continues to grow. We would like to remove the tree and its roots entirely. This is the only tree we wish to remove.",
