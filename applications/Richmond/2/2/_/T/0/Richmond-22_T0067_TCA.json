  "description": "By way of background, my family and I unfortunately suffered a violent break-in at our home last week, at 50 Kew Green, TW9 3BB, which falls within a conservation area. Amongst the advice provided by the police was that we should remove the tree at the front of our house and one to the rear, as it provides shelter and a hiding place to potential intruders. We are, of course, very keen to act upon this advice, having been significantly shaken and having sustained injuries during the events of last week.\r\rThere is also some concern that, due to its proximity to our Patio walls, the tree could ultimately damage the integrity of the structure.\r\rThe tree to the front of the property is a silver birch and located behind a brick wall surrounding the patio. \rThe second tree is to the rear of the property on Old Dock Close planted within a flower bed. It backs on to our property. The tree has been completely cut back. It is of unknown species, consisting of a number of very narrow (less than 50cm diameter) trunks. I have spoken to the owner of the land on which the tree is situated and she is in agreement that it can be removed. The individual involved is very elderly and has asked that I organise any works required to have the tree cut or removed.",
