  "description": "It is our understanding that the large Sycamore very close to our property at 1b Warwick Close was issued a TPO, as were several other trees in the development, when the houses 1a and 1b Warwick Close were built around 2008. The trees around the properties had not been maintained in any way until we moved in 5 years ago and we have tried to care for them as best as possible. However the large Sycamore is much too close to our property and our tree surgeon agrees it should not have been retained during the site development. \r\rThis large Sycamore is a threat regarding damage to our property and is a danger to us and our children who play in the gardens and driveway. I attach a recent photo of two large branches over 5m in length which came down during the storms earlier this year. We have experienced damage to our garage roof on a previous occasion with falling branches, telephone wires have previously been brought down and have had several other near misses to our property and cars. We are concerned for our family and children's safety as branches can often drop in days after storms when the winds have calmed down. \r\rWe would like to propose to remove this hazardous tree ASAP and to plant more 2-3 new trees in its place which are safer, smaller and more sympathetic to their surroundings.",
