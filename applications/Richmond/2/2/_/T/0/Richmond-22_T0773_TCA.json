  "description": "Magnolia acuminata (commonly known as the cucumber tree).  \rThe tree is more than 5 metres (16 feet) high and can ultimately grow to more than 12 metres (39 feet) high and 8 metres (26 feet) wide.\t\rTree information states that the cucumber tree's wide root system means it is best planted at least 15 metres (50 feet) from house.  It is now only 3 metres (10 feet) from house and 0.7 metre (27 inches) from the manhole over the shared sewer. \rTo be removed and replaced with a Japanese Maple cultivar, Acer japonicum 'Vitifolium'.\rThis smaller, slow growing tree will be planted farther from the house and is well suited to the restricted space in the 7 x 6 metre (23 x 20 feet) 279 garden. It reaches an ultimate height and spread of 4 meters over 20 years, smaller than other Japanese Maple species.\rSee sketch plan and photos.",
