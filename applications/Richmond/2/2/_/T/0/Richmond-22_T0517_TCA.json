  "description": "The tree we want to remove is a small Prunus planted by our gardener  in 1998\r\rIt has stopped growing and going into leaf for the past two years ; as it is dead we want to remove it. It is at the rear of our back garden between our garden hut and arbor . It is a small compact tree and will be easily removed. It is unsightly and we would want to remove it before it becomes unsafe.",
