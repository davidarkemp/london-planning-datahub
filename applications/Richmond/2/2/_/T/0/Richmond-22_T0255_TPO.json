To Pollard to a new height of approx 3m from ground level. Retain any furnishing growth where possible. This is to retain screening and allow re-growth. Reason for works, severe decay found at base and tree could fail onto building - This Tree will be Pollard by approx 6m to leave a new height of approx 3m, crown spread remaining 1-1.5m\rG1 - Group of Cypress/Hedge. To reduce height by approx 7m to previous reduction height, this will leave approx 7m from ground level.
