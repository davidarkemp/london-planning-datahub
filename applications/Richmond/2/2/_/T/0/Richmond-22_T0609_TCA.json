  "description": "Large yew tree (1) close to the rear boundary of the property. It is desired to fell this tree due to its disproportionate size in the garden, the heavy shade it casts over a large area and also due its proximity to an old brick wall. It is growing in a raised bed retained by sleepers which have all rotted. The plan is to level this area and replace the yew with a number of deciduous pleached trees for screening and habitat and also an additional specimen deciduous tree.",
