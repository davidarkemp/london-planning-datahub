Areas of the wall have been replaced/repaired in the past but two areas look the most precarious at present, these two sections are being considered for replacement.\rIn order for the builders to safely remove these sections of walling & carry out a reduction dig of the soil area, some trees/stumps will require removal.\r\rItem/Species.\t\t\tWorks Requested.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\rSection A: (Adjacent to T 13: x 2 Yew stumps & T14: x 1 Yew tree)- see Photos 1 & 2\r\rT13.
