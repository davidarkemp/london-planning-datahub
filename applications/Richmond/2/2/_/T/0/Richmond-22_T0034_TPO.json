  "description": "T1 Oak - TPO 1380089\rThin by up to 5-10% of branches over garden of 41 Elmfield by up to 1.5m  (as last approved on 22/6/2017), dead wooding\rThe height of the tree AFTER the work is estimated to be 20m and width 15m\rReasons for work:\r1. Approval given previously for this work on 22/6/2017. A 300 year old oak tree requires management. The owner refuses to manage her tree presumably because it sits 100 metres from her property and does not affect her property but it is 25m from our property with 40% of the branches overhanging our garden \r2. The owner should care about the tree as a recent site inspection of the tree by the Tree Agency  identified deadwood in the tree that needs removing. There is a risk of this falling on us when we are using the garden and causing serious injury or death.\r3. The light in the garden of 41 is much reduced by the tree by overhanging branches which increase year by year. This is so much so that recently, and we would not have chosen to do this from an environmental point of view, we had the entire lawn replaced with artificial turf as the real lawn laid 3 years ago completely died in the shade of the tree. The trimming works 4 years ago helped for a couple of years. We have just re-planted our borders and trimming back would allow some light to reach the new plants. The tree takes so much water that the plants struggle to survive in 2 of our borders closest to the tree",
