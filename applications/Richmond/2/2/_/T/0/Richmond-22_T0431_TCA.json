  "description": "T1 Magnolia:\rSurvey notes: This tree is of good health and normal vigour. This tree has been crown reduced in the past to contain its crown within the small back garden. \rRecommendation: Crown reduce removing approximately 1000mm of height and lateral growth.  Height reduced from 7m to 6m\r\rT3 - Mimosa:\rSurvey notes: This tree is growing too close to both nearby properties; the stem is 3m from number 80 and 4.4m from number 78.  The crown is almost in contact with number 80; the crown has been heavily reduced in the past, presumably to manage this growth.  \rThe crown dominates this part of the site making the area very dark and unusable; the tree is unsuitable for its location.  A poor fork / union exists at 1.4m on the main stem. \rRecommendation: Fell to ground level.",
