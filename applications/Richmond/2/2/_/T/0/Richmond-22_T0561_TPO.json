  "description": "The two ash trees, T1 and T2 as per the TPO, have grown in very close proximity and therefore has caused both of them to spread their canopy's only over one side. Leading to the management of the trees to be more tailored to treating them as one tree. Similar to a duel stemmed ash tree.\rAppropriate work:\rTrees approx height at present is 17m\rProposed reduction in height 3m\rRemove deadwood\r10% thin of crown of branches below 40mm Cut previously pruned pegs back to stem Remove any rubbing or overlapping branches\rThis would leave a canopy radial spread of 3.5 metres and leave a height of the tree at 15 metres",
