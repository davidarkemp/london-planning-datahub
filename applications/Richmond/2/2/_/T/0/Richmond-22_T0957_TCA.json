  "description": "The tree is question is a non-fruiting cherry tree. The tree was in poor condition when we purchased the property 6 years ago and has suffered the ravages of warm summers. It is dying in increments, this summer losing almost 60% of its canope in one season. We have removed dead limbs form the tree which overhand a public path and a private path. The remaining canopy  is in poor health, is asymetrical and is ugly. The tree has fungus and sabre wasp infestation.\r\rOur plan is to fell the tree to ground level, remove as luch of the immediate root system as possible and to re-plant a cherry tree in its place.\r\rOur aim is to plant a tree approximately 3m in height, to grow to 6m. Prunus sargentii and Prunus serrula would be our trees of choice form a large selection at www.majestictrees.co.uk, but the exact species of cherry/plum will depend on what there is available.\r\rOur plan is to get a tree in the ground as soon as possible after winter. We will have to undertake some ground radar work as we do not know where out electricity cable is.",
