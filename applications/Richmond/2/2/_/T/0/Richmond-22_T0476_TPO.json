  "description": "T415 Common Lime, ffb (rigidiporus ulmaris) located at the base of this tree on the compression side of the buttress. When sounded with a mallet decay appears to be localised however the tree leans towards footpath and a well used seating area by the river. It is also recently exposed to the elements following the failure of T414 and the subsequent removal of T413 due to significant Kretzschmaria decay at the base. \rCurrent height 18 metres, finished pollarded height to suitable unions 12 metres as shown in photo. Remove Epicormic growth up to 10 metres.\r\rT416 Common Lime, Located 2 metres from no 29. A climbing inspection by another local contractor has identified a pocket of decay on the main stem. \rThis was not picked up in the report by SJA as their VTA was only from GL. In the report the Consequences of this tree failing are noted as 'minor' which given how close it is to the property and the extent of the overhang I'm not quite sure how they have come to this conclusion, although they were not aware of the pocket of decay further up the main stem. The tree is oppressive when in leaf and the front and side of the property are very dark as a result. This tree is also now exposed following the loss of T414 & T413. Current height 21 metres, finished pollarded height to suitable unions 13 metres as shown in the annotated photo. Remove Epicormic growth up to 11 metres.",
