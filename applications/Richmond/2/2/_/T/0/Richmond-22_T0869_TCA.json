Olea europaea - removal\r\rThese three trees are crowded into the front garden of a newly purchased house along with a number of other shrubby species, casting excessive shade on the house, and are generally overbearing to an extent that doesn't seem to be sustainable. There is an issue with the soil level in the front garden which is too high in relation to the house and likely causing damp problems. The overall plan is to remove the woody plants and re-plant the garden with nectar-rich herbaceous species instead.",
