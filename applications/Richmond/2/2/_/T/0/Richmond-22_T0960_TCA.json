  "description": "T1 - Corkscrew Willow\rRequesting permission to reduce lowest limb back to boundary line of 24 Watts Lane. Limb currently at 10ft height from ground level which spans over neighbours garden (number 24). \rThere will still be an overhang of the upper canopy over the boundary line however applicant just wants to have this lower branch pruned so that the lower canopy is lifted. Due to the type of the tree the foliage drapes into the garden which is why applicant would like limb to be reduced to avoid this foliage taking up space in the garden.",
