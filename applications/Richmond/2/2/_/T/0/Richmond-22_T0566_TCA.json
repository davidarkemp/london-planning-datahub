  "description": "There are two large trees in the back left hand corner of the garden (one inside the fence line and one outside the fence line but within the property boundary line) - these are very close to the house and I feel could cause damage to the property if they were to fall.\rI propose to fell the tree inside the fence line due to excessive shading to the garden and potential to damage the house. Happy to replace this tree with a smaller tree if that aides this application.\rI propose to trim back the large branches on the tree outside the fence line but within the boundary line due to excessive shading to the garden and potential damage to the house.The canopy stretches around 3.5 metres into the garden so that is the amount that I am requesting to trim back - I estimate that this would still leave a canopy of 3.5m on the opposite side of the tree. I estimate that by doing this I would take off around 2 metres of the height of the tree - leaving the remaining tree around 4 metres tall\rThe trees are circled on the attached land registry document in the back left portion of the garden.",
