  "description": "It is a 20 metre high sycamore tree that began life as an unplanted seedling - in effect as a weed. I am concerned about the size of the tree and if it were to fall in any direction it would cause significant damage and also is a there would be a significant risk of injury and to life to occupants of the surrounding houses and to pedestrians. Ducks Walk is a very busy walk/cycle through.\rI would like to suggest that the tree is removed and is replaced by something less dangerous - not as tall and also in sympathy with the surrounding area such as a magnolia. All these works would be carried out at my cost as owner of 1A Ducks Walk .",
