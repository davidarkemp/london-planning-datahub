  "description": "T1 on the sketch is a large, dying ornamental cherry tree, almost as high as the house and growing out over our neighbour's garden (No 5 Clarence Road), over the street, engulfing the street lamppost.\rThe tree has been ailing for sometime and is no longer ornamental.  The hot summer seems to have hasten its demise and it was practically leafless by early September.\rIn any case, it is too large, unhealthy and we would like to remove it.\rReplanting is not indicated; there is a lovely weeping birch, a variagated holly and other shrubs which will thrive once this tree is removed.\rI am applying for permission to fell the tree entirely.",
