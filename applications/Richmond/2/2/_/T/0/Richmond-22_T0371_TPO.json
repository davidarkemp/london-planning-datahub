  "description": "Rear alley way\rT1\tHorse Chestnut x 1\t(Aesculus hippocastanum)This large previously reduced mature tree with bark fissures throughout the crown \r\tand included unions and crown break is severely blocking light from several \r\tgardens and properties. Permission previously received in 2020 however it has not been pruned in approx 9 years.\r\tTo improve light to entire garden and property and to lessen weight and slow root expansion.\r\tSuggested works:\r\t- Reduce all round to previous reduction points approx. 4m\r\t- lift on back side to balance crown by approx. 2-3m\r- The tree is approx 22m high and 16m wide we are doing an approx. reduction of 4m leaving a crown of approx.. 18m high and 13m wide",
