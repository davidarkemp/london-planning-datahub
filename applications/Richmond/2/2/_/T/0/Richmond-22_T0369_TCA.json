They don't regenerate as well as deciduous trees. Root pruning isn't done nowadays and can destabilise the tree. \r\rIf re-doing the Astroturf is the goal, it's likely the tree roots will need to be replaced and replacing the tree might be the only option. To keep tree roots contained a box around the stump of the tree with root barriers can prevent long trailing roots. \r\rT2\tAsh\tRemove the limb rubbing on roof.",
