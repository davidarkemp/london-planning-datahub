  "description": "Trees 1 and 2 are two large tress as part of a Cypress hedge that provide a shield at the end of our back garden. They are currently approximately 10m high and we are requesting to reduce them to approximately 6m to roughly match our neighbours hedge. They will also be trimmed on the garden side by approximately 4m to keep them in generally good condition and stop them over-growing and preventing light etc. into our garden.\r\rTree 3 is another part of the Cypress hedge at the end of our back garden which has died (potentially due to Trees 1 and 2 getting too large) and starving it of water and light. Request to fell the remaining trunk and grind out stump.\r\rTree 4 (which is split into a main tree and a small secondary tree) is a Monterey Cypress which is diseased and dying and collapsing. It is approximately 5m tall. Request to fell this tree and grind out stump to allow replacement planting. Exact type of replacement tree undecided at this time but it will be a significantly smaller evergreen tree - final decision to be taken once we have understood the remaining coverage from neighbour's trees.\r\rSketch attached along with photos. Also attached quote from Tree surgeon to confirm diagnosis referenced above.",
