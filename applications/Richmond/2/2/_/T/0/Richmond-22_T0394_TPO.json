  "description": "T1: Holm oak (Quercus ilex)- Reduction of 30% back to previous pruning points to reduce weight and sail effect on over extended limbs. The tree is approx 8m high currently and will be 5/6m following, and approx 7.5m wide and will be 5m following the work. \rT2: Coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)- Upon inspection suspected basal decay was identified on one side of the tree. The PICUS testing suggested no concern for the tree's health (supporting document attached). Residents would still like a light crown reduction of approx 2m all round. The tree is currently 15m high and will be 13m high after, approx 6m wide and will be 5m after.\rT3: Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa)- To separate the canopy tangled in the neighbouring trees, deadwood and reduce the 2 lowest South facing laterals which overhang a garage area from approx 4m to 2/3m.\rT4: Lime (tilia)- 40% pollard (approx 3m below previous points) as it has outgrown its current position, and some residents voiced concerns regarding its stability due to natural/wildlife induced holes. It is currently 9m high and 2m wide and will be 5/6m high and 2m wide following the work. \rT5&6: Lime x 2 (tilia)- Routine repollard of appox 30% to prolong life of the tree and reduce risk of limb failure. Currently approx 8.5/9m high and 2m wide, will remain 2m wide and 6/7m high after. \rT7: Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanu s)- Clear up the snap out caused by the neighbouring failed cedar to reduce the chance of decay/disease entering the tree and deadwood the rest of the canopy.\rT8&T9: Swamp cypress (Taxodium distichum) and Tulip tree- Both trees would benefit from a deadwood",
