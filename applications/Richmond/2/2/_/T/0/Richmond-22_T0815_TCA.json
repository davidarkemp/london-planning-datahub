  "description": "The tree is located at the front of my garden on the right side (when face the house.) The reasons for my application are:\r\r- I believe the tree needs to be removed before it causes damage to telephone wires\r- It is a health hazard having slippery bird poop on a busy walkway. \r- The tree is tangled up with telephone wires providing the houses on The Embankment with a service.\r- Birds sit in the tree eating the seeds and foliage then poop over the walkway outside numbers 7 and 8 The Embankment making the pavement slippery and \runpleasant.\r- The tree is almost touching my neighbours house (8 The Embankment) which is unsatisfactory.\r- If the crown of the tree was reduced to acoid the telephone wires then there would only be a trunk left. \r- I have spoken with an arborist who has advised that the tree should be removed.\r- The tree does not have a TPO.\r- I believe the tree is a Laburnocytisus",
