  "description": "This request is too pollard to crown break three London Plane trees that are situated in the small rear gardens of three small cottages, build on a previously large garden plot of an ordinal house. The works requested are as per previously undertaken work under 14/T0850/TCA and 17/T0847/TCA.\rThe request is made to manage what are now large trees in small rear gardens, in close proximity to the cottages themselves and to help reduce any future risk of damage to those properties.\rThe trees in question are marked as T1, T2, and T3 on the sketch plan. they are about 2m to 2.5m from the buildings.",
