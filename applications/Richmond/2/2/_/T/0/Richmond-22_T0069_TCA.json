Proposed works are to reduce the crown shortening branches as necessary and to prevent the tree overhanging the street and touching the building. Reduce height by 2.5 metres approx and re shape all round outer parts of crown to create a balanced shape - remaining crown size will be 5m Height and 3.5m overall Width",
