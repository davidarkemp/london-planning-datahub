  "description": "T2 - Mature London Plane tree, reduce the height of the canopy by approximately 2.5m and reduce the lower right branch as shown in the attached photograph by approximately 3.0m, utilising suitable regrowth points with each cut made. Also remove all major dead wood.\r\rT4 - Yew tree, crown reduce in height by approximately 30% and reduce the lateral spread of the tree all around by approximately 0.5m, retaining the greenery. The tree has grown to large for its space and we would like to contain it.\r\rT6 - Lime tree, crown reduce back to the previous points of reduction, approximately 3.0m in height and 2.0m in lateral spread. Remove all major dead wood. \r\rT7 - Mature Oak tree, reduce the height of the canopy by approximately 2.5m and the lateral spread of the canopy by approximately 2.5m, utilising suitable regrowth points with each cut made. Also remove all major dead wood. These works are intended to reduce the risk of limb failure, particularly on the major branches that overhang the property and the pathway/road directly on the other side of the fence.\r\rT8 - Lime tree, crown reduce back to the previous points of reduction, approximately 1.5m in height and 1.0m in lateral spread. Remove all major dead wood. \r\rThe intention of these works are to continue the ongoing maintenance of the Lime trees, contain the size of the Yew tree and retain the treasured natural aesthetic of T2 - Plane and T7 - Oak whilst reducing the risk of any potential hazards the best that we can.",
