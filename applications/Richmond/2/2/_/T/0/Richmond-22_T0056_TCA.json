  "description": "We have a mains water leak under a Yew tree (EH No.1) on site, see attached photos. The pipe is damaged, this pipe supplies water to Marble Hill House and also for the fire hydrants, as the water is currently turned off this is a serious fire risk for this historic property and the supply needs to be urgently restored. \r\rTo repair the pipe we will need to sever some tree roots, we will use flexible pipe work where possible around roots. The works will be supervised by an Arboricultural consultant who will ensure minimal damage, clean cuts and minimal removal of roots, only enough to allow access so that the pipe can be repaired.",
