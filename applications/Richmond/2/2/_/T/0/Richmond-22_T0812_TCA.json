  "description": "(T1) Silver Birch (Betula Pendula)\r- fell to ground level\r\rThe tree's base is within 2.5 meters of the property. The tree's canopy extends over the rear extension's roof. This causes leaves, twigs and small branches to fall onto the roof, which negatively impacts it and blocks gutters. The roof needs replacing. Total removal of the tree will prevent any potential future damage to the property.\r\r\r(T2) Apple (Malus)\r- fell to ground level\r\rThe tree's base is within 30cm of the garden studio study. The tree is extremely overgrown and its branches and leaves extend over the roof of the studio, which again cause issues with the roofing material and quality. Rotting apples also add to the issues. Total removal will prevent any potential future damage.",
