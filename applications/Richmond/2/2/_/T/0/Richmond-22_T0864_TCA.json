The spread will be reduced by 1m from 4m to 3m\rT2 Lawson Cypress, remove. The tree is of low amenity value and not in keeping with the appearance of the rest of the area. It totally shades the garden and neighbouring gardens also.\rT3 Magnolia, reduce overhanging branches. The branches cause shade. The tree belongs to a neighbouring property.",
