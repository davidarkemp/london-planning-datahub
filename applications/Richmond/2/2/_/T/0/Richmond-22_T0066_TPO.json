  "description": "large Fir Tree. \rThis tree looks like it has been lopped in the past and looking up from the ground has had branches that have snapped off due to its age and weigh on to the roof and glass veranda covering of 37.\rA large branch of this tree is hanging over no 37. The roots have already undermined the fencing and more worrying the path directly next to the foundations of the property. \rThe tree needle droppings  have blocked the guttering and water drains.\rWe would like to apply to have this tree properly lopped or If this would undermine the trees balance then we would be happy to pay for this tree to be professionally removed and to be replaced with something mature that is more suitable to foundations and of course under your expert advice and guidance. We are suggesting mature silver birches.\rThe committee of Trowlock have no objection of the removal and replacement of this tree",
