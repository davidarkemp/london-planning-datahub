  "description": "Sycamore Tree\r\rThe tree has become extremely large and is encroaching on nearby properties. The tree is also dropping branches from time to time which could result in injury to persons beneath the tree as well as damage to properties. The tree is also restricting light into neighbours property. I therefore request that the following works can be undertaken. \r\rWorks requested:-\r\rPollard by reduce height to 10m and reduce all lateral growth by 3m all round, back to cuts 100mm in diameter. Removal of all dead wood and sucker growth leaving crown spread to approximately 6m diameter.",
