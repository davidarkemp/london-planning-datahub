  "description": "Front garden\r2 x Catepla (indian bean tree), crown thin by 15% and thin lateral growing hedge. Removing growth of a maximum of 3cm in diameter or 2/3m in length. This will enable both trees to be able to sustain themselves against becoming wind blown during heavy wind. Remove 1 stem growing over northern side over hedge, to give a uniformed shape and stop the tree from interfering with the hedge\r1 x Holly (ilex aqufolium) crown reduce by 50%. Shape and create lollipop Reason, the Holly is fighting for light growing in a overcrowded area. The Holly is causing a hazard growing over the pavement on Trafalgar road and forcing the public to duck under the growth, i also think the tree has become very leggy and would respond very well to be managed in this way and then clipped annually to become alluring to bird life.\rRear garden\rPlum (prunus) crown reduce by 3m. Reason, tree is a self set multi stem, grown underneath a large Acer fighting for light and has become leggy. Prune to consolidate shape.\rWalnut (jugulans nigra) crown thin by removal of 3cm 2/3m stems alternate stems. Reason, to minimise wind-sale, this will help the tree because the tree is growing in close proximity of a wall that is of significant value due to conservation status. I am also concerned of the rootstock ability to withstand high wind.\rPear (Pyrus Chanticleer) crown clean and dead wood. Reason, to Improve health of tree. Remove dead wood and broken stems.",
