  "description": "We have a laurel shrub which has become a tree. It is marked as Laurel 1 on the diagram. It stands between the yew tree and the house and grows outwards from under the canopy of the yew tree.\r\rIn the image laurel 1 c. the lower bough can be seen resting on the wall. We are concerned for public safety and would like permission to remove this bough completely so that the danger is removed. The point at which the bough we propose to be removed joins the main trunk can be seen in image laurel 1 b and that is where it would be cut.\r\rWe would also like permission to remove the sprouting foliage coming from the base so that the ground surrounding it is more easily accessible.\r\rThe canopy has grown quite large for a laurel. I estimate it to be between about 3 and 4 metres across depending from which angle it is viewed as it is a very irregular shape, and attains a height of around 4 metres at its tallest point. It also leans at overall at an angle of about 30 degrees towards the road, towards the light, in response to the shade of the canopy of the yew tree above and beside it.\r\rWe would like to reduce the canopy to an average diameter of 2 to 3 metres in such a way that\ra metre gap is created between the grade 2 listed house and the tree\r the light to the adjacent window is increased\r the overall height is partially reduced\r the canopy still appears pleasing to passers-by outside our property\r clearance above peoples heads as they pass is increased\r\rWe believe that the removal of the single large bough mentioned above will accomplish much of this, and after that is done, the rest will be a matter of artistry as well as skill to shape and complete the goals as stated.\rThe work would be conducted by people qualified to do things safely while respecting the integrity of the tree\r",
