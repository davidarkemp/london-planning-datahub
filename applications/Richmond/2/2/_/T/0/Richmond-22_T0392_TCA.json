There are signs of severe decline, with considerable loss of leaf density\rThere is no long term benefit achieved by retaining the tree.\r\rRecommendations\rFell to ground level and remove all arisings.\rStump grinding, remove arisings and replace with new topsoil.\rReplant with small to medium sized tree, to maintain the local amenity.\rReplacement tree to be chosen from the suggested list in Appendix 1, or similar as agreed with Tree Officer e.g. Pleached Holm oak",
