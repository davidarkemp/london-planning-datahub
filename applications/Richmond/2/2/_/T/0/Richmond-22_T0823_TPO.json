  "description": "T1 Sycamore - Fell and grind out stump. Replant with 12-14 specimen further away from wall. Felling is required due to the tree pushing over a grade 1 listed wall onto the pavement and highway.\rT2 Sycamore - Reduce the 2 lowest overextended limbs by no more than 1.5 meters to prevent failure - Final approximate length of branches 6.5M \rT3 Yew - Fell and grind out the stump to allow for the grade 1 listed wall to be fixed\rT4 - HolmOak - Raise the crown by 2 meters to an even spread to lift over road and building - Raise the crown to 5.5 meters\rT5 Magnolia - Remove 2 semi mature sucker growth to thin crown\rT6 Robinia - Reduce the crown by 3 meters to prevent failure to tree - Final approximate height 15M and Width 8M  Extensive decay present and works are necessary to retain tree\rT7 Hornbeam - Reduce the crown by no more than 1 meter to allow more light into the garden and to minimise growth over Wiggins lane - Final approximate height 15M width 7M \rT8 Yew - Reduce the crown by 0.5 meters to tidy up and allow light into house and garden - Final approximate height 16M width 10M \rT9 Sycamore - Reduce the crown by 2 meters to around the previous reduction points. This is to get more light into garden, house, adjoining house and prevent regrowth failure - Final approximate height 23M width 11M \rT10 Magnolia - Reduce the crown by no more than 1 meter to allow light into kitchen window - Final approximate height 11m and width 8m",
