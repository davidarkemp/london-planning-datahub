  "description": "London Plane reference TP095/74 G18 located in Fieldend bordering my property at 10 Arlington Rd. \rProposed work is to reduce crown such that tree measures approx 15m height by 8m spread (= overall reduction of 5m). Tree spread covers significant area of gardens of 8,10 & 12 Arlington road causing health & safety issues.\rAttached photos show the size of the branches, the quantity I found in the garden at 10 Arlington Rd in a 2 day period and the fruit fibres which fall into the gardens and onto the properties. Also of concern is the root system and its potential damage to the properties structures.\rThe tree is considered a low amenity tree to Fieldend.",
