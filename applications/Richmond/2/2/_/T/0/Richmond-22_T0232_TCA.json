  "description": " We are proposing the following works to trees at 40a park road , hampton wick. None of the trees are subject to a TPO but the property is in a conservation area, hence the application. \r\rFell and remove horse chestnut trees t1 and t2 in the rear garden of 40a park road. These 2 trees are in the middle of the garden as per the attached plans . T2 is less than 2metres from the house and has some branches over the glass conservatory which has low amenity value and excessive shading as well as the potential for branches to fall on the glass roof. T1 is parallel to t2 and a further 3m away from the property. They are in the middle of the garden within the boundaries on the property 40a. Our application is as the new owners of the property having exchanged contracts and due to move in on 7th April 2022.\r\rNeither tree provides any form of privacy from neighbouring properties and are within the rear garden of a private property. \r\rTree t3 is in the front garden of the property . Its bed and roots are right next to the house and would need regular cutting back or it encroaches onto the roof and walls of the property. We propose to undertake a thinning and reduction of the crown in order to keep it from interfering with the front of the property (40a park road). We propose to reduce the length of the crown from 6m to 4m removing from the top of the tree where it encroaches on 2nd floor windows and the roof of the property.",
