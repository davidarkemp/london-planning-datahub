  "description": "Beech  - Crown lift to 3.5m above ground by removing secondary branches. Crown reduction of up to 2m all round. Removal of dead / dying branches. Current diameter of the tree is approx 14m-17m (7-8.5 radius). Height difficult to estimate as so tall but approx 16m. There is a cobra brace holding the 2 main boughs upright, it is important to reduce some weight from both boughs to prevent it becoming dangerous. The last work carried out by the previous owners was in Dec 2011 with a crown reduction to 5m radius. I applied for tree works on this beech tree and adjacent oak tree (T14) in Oct 2020. You approved an alternative specification on Dec 24th 2020 for both trees. However, for the beech tree the reduction was only permitted for the limb supported by the bracing system.",
