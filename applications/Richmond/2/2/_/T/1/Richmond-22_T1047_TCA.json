  "description": "1 x Tillia cordata - Has been pollarded previously and would like to prune back growth to original pollard points and also clear low growing suckers from tree base. \rThe crown reduction is the growth from the pollards and is a maximum of 1m - 3m maximum and diameter of 1cm - 4cm max No reduction of the original pollard points Removal of basal suckers back to tree base these are 1m - 2.5m in length and 1cm - 3cm diameter. \r\rThe crown spread will be 6m - 8.5m post pruning.\r\rThere is an old retaining wall at base of tree which is beginning to move due as tree base is pushing out. We are looking to remove wall and improving size of wall and giving the base more room. As the garden and house is being renovated and landscaped.\r\r1x Quercus ilex- has been badly pruned and topped previously -(probably without permission) would like to 25% crown thin and tidy up some of the epicormic growth Growth selected to be pruned back to base structure is 0.40m x 1m in length. Diameter of 0.5mm - 15mm max.\rThe trunk will be pruned clear to 1.9 of the ground.\rThe height will be retained and a central leader select to continue to grow and improve the look of the tree.",
