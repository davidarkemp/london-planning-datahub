  "description": "T0015 T28 SILVER BIRCH - Crown lift to give clearance of up to 3m from ground level. Lower branches are currently hanging over the pavement. Tree currently stands at approx 15m in height with a diameter of 5m - removing a max of nine of the small lower branches. The biggest branch to be removed is a max of 3.5cm in diameter. The lowest branch to be removed currently sits at 1.5m from ground level and the highest branch to be removed currently sits at 2.5m from ground level. Therefore, the work would involve removing lower branches by 1m. \r - pruning of any foliage growing downwards from higher branches overhanging and obstructing the pavement to 3m from ground level. This would involve pruning current overhanging foliage growth by 1m maximum.\r",
