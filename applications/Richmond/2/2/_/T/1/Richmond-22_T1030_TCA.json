  "description": "Crab apple (Malus Sylvestris) tree located in the grass verge directly in front of our property. Most of the canopy and lower branches of the southern aspect of the tree facing our house, are overhanging our front garden and from September to November this results in a large amount of unwanted ripe fruit falling into our property causing considerable environmental damage. At the same time a number of the higher branches are touching nearby telephone/cable wires. The tree therefore needs to be pruned in order to remedy both issues.",
