  "description": "Mulberry - Reduce weight on sideways growing branches to prevent any further limbs falling and to keep a more regular shape as there is limited growth at top and only sideways growth.Remove dead wood - tree is currently 14m wide by 8m high. We want to reduce weight on just two lateral branches (one to the left and one to the right side of the tree). We want to remove a 3m section of branch on left hand side and a 2m section of branch on the right hand side. This would leave the tree to have the same height of 8m and approx 9m across.",
