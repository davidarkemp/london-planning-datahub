  "description": "Location: Front Garden \r1. Lime x 2 \tRe-grown old pollarded trees with 'new' canopies of approx. 30+ years old.\rMinor trunk cavities from past pruning, these two trees along with the other x 4 trees outside 96a (question) & 94 are under Tree Preservation Orders.\r\rThe recent application to pollard at 'original' knuckles (at 4.5 m) is pretty severe that would allow a president for other tree owners to also carry out the same disfiguring works.\r\rPersonally, I would suggest just 'tidying' up the trees by light thinning, removal of deadwood & stubs. Alternatively, they could be lightly reduced by approx. 3-4 m and still retain their dignity and still look like attractive trees. I have to say I am in agreement with the council that re-pollarding is undesirable.\r\rItem/Species.\t\t\tWorks Requested.\r\rLocation: Front Garden \r1. Lime x 2 (central trees) \tReduce canopies by 3.5-4 m & shape (due to weakness at lower trunk cavities)\r\t\t\t\t(approx. height 14m -reduce to approx. 10m)\rThin canopies by 20%, remove deadwood stubs & suckers.",
