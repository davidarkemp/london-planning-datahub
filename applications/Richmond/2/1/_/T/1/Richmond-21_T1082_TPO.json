This tree has over extended limbs over the road and into the school play area and reducing the canopy will reduce the risk of failure in these limbs.\r\rT3 Lime Prune back the branches contacting the phone wires to provide 1.5 metres clearance\r\rT4 Norway maple - Raise the secondary branches over the bike shelter to provide 1.5 - 2 metres clearance.\r\rT5 Chestnut - Reduce the overextended southerly limb by 1.5- 2 metres to prevent the likely hood of failure.\r\rT6 Plum -  Fell - Resonance testing and the presence of fungal activity indicate the tree is decayed and may fail.\r\rT7 Cherry  - Crown lift secondary branches to 2 metres to provide clearance for pedestrians.\r\rT8 Magnolia crown lift removing secondary branches to provide 2 metres clearance over the pavement and 5 metres over the road to prevent obstructions to vehicles and pedestrians.",
