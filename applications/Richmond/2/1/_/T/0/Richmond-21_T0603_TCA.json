  "description": "Silver Birch - Fell - due to excessive shading to neighbouring gardens. Neighbours have requested the silver birch is felled as it creates excessive shading to their small narrow gardens. Neighbour at no20 has identified the potential damage of the tree roots to her property and ours for insurance purposes. The Silver Birch is towering above all the cottages and is out of proportion for a cottage garden. It can been see over the roof of the cottages from the front. The tree was pruned back in 2019. It is estimated to be 10 metres high and 8 metres wide. \rI am concerned that the roots have the potential to damage the sewers that run along all the gardens about 2 metres from the trunk of the tree (see thames water sewer plan).",
