The tree is spreading across the front of the school forecourt and the lower branches are starting to cause a hazard for delivery vehicles and pedestrians.The tree is currently around 10 metres high with a radius of 7 metres to most branches but one branch that extends to around 8 metres. The proposal is to reduce the height to around 7 metres and tidy up the canopy to a maximum radius of around 5 metres. We will rely on the third party arborist to achieve a good shape both aesthetically and for the health of the tree.",
