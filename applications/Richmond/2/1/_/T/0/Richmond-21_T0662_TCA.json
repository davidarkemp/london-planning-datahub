  "description": "We are applying to remove a small Eugenia Uniflora tree which is causing damage to the adjacent structures and could lead to potential hazard. The tree was planted too close to our property of 2 Sheendale Road and straddles the boundary of 3 sheendale road. It's believed to be causing damage to the drainage system passing underneath which has led to repairs, as well as potentially causing issues with the party wall. In addition, its unripened berries from this tree are toxic for humans and dogs which are present.\r\rWe are able to offset the removal of the tree with the planting a different tree further down the garden, away from the properties. This is seen in the drawing attached.",
