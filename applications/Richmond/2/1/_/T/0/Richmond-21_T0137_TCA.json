  "description": "T1 - The laurel tree to the rear has not been well maintained and has grown onto a dilapidated shed, which is in need of removal and replacement. The felling of the laurel will allow the shed to be replaced with a larger shed. Due to the limited width of the garden and healthy number of trees already within the curtilage of the property, a replacement tree is not proposed.\r\rT2 and T3 - The 2 remaining laurel trees require a crown reduction of approximately 1.5-2m (see supporting document titled Tree Works 1), which will allow natural light into the garden and improve its visual appearance.\r\rT4 - The olive tree in the front garden is too large for the small garden and restricts natural light to the ground floor front windows. A crown reduction of approximately 1-1.5m is proposed and the tree trimmed to shape (see document titled Tree Works 2).",
