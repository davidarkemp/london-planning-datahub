  "description": "The large Beech Tree covered by TPO TO453 located in the front garden of 107 Park Road, has grown considerably since we first moved into 107A Park Road in 1999. Although this tree has been trimmed over the past 22 years, it has expanded considerably. The Beech tree is now lopsided, extends over the boundary of 107 Park Road by more than 3 meters and blocks natural light from the front of 107A Park Road. The result is that  artificial lighting is required for the entrance hall and first floor office of 107A Park Road 24 hours a day. While we appreciate the amenity value of this tree, it should be possible to manage the tree so that it retains good form without having a negative impact on the quality of life of people living close. I believe it is the responsibility of everyone to attempt to reduce their carbon footprints, we have done this by insulating our home and changing incandescent bulbs to LED units, but wasteful electricity is still being consumed due to the excessive shading of the Beech Tree.\r\rWe propose that the side of the tree overhanging 107A Park road should be reduced by some 3 metres in order to reduce and thin the crown. This would have the double benefit of allowing natural light to once again be enjoyed by residents of 107A Park Road as well as reducing the electricity consumed through artificial lighting.",
