  "description": "Tree L1: Lime. The proposed re-pollarding would crown to the previous pollard point (10m above ground level), by removal of the top 10 metres of re-growth (previous pollard was more than 20 years ago) ,The side branches below this point overhanging the gardens will be trimmed back to the trunk , in the case of those below 6m from the ground (approx 4m length - none of these branches exceed 24cm girth - 8cm diameter) while those at 8m above ground will be brought back to within 1 to 2 metres from the trunk - so by between 4 and 8m depending on branch length) to provide shape to this end tree, while leaving a halo to the neighbour's cherry tree and allowing light into the gardens below. Side branches within the line of the trees will be left to provide screening between neighbouring properties.\rTree L2: Lime. Proposed re-pollard to crown at 10m above ground, by removing 10m of re-growth (previous pollard over 20 years ago). Side branches below crown will be trimmed back to the trunk except where they provide lateral screening - none are of significant girth.\rTree L3: Lime. This tree forks at 6m above ground. The main fork was previously pollarded at about 10m above ground (more than 20 years ago) , and it is proposed to re-pollard to that point by removal of the 10m of re-growth. The second fork will also be reduced to the same level by removal of the 10m above that point. Side branches below the crown/pollard point will be trimmed back to the trunk except where they provide lateral screening. The ivy will be left to add to the screening and as valuable habitat.\rTree L4: Lime. Proposed re-pollard to crown at 10m above ground by removing 10m of re-growth above that point (previous pollard over 20 years ago). Side branches will be trimmed back to the trunk except where they provide lateral screening. Ivy and clematis below the crown will be left.",
