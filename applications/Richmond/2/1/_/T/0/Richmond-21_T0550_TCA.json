  "description": "T1 - Arbutus Unedo: 6m height, 20cm DBH. Located at front of property within walled front garden on the corner of the footpath and adjacent turn, the tree blocks morning sunlight considerably shading front of house on both floors. Tree has previously been crown raised but requires overall canopy reduction of maximum 1m to suitable growth points in accordance to BS3998 to allow more light past to the house windows - Resultant tree heigh of 5m and spread of 4m\r\rT2 - Garrya Elliptica: 6m height. Located climbing on house and front door. Spreading overly tall and wide on the house this shrubby tree requires reduction of up to 2.5m and triming by 0.3-0.5m to prevent damage to gutter and allow increase light and visibilty to house and windows -  Resultant height of 3.5m and spread of 2.5m\r\rT3 - Prunus: This tree, located in rear garend at Southern boundary fence to footpath, has been heavily partially reduced at major crown break fork back to a large cut finished with a face carved onto the exposed cut by chainsaw. Innapropriate works and defacing of this Cherry have significanlty upset the resident. Proposed work are to tidy the large cut and attempt to reduce the remaining limb delicately. Permission is required to fell this tree, with intention to replant another fruit tree in its place; if upon closer inspection the form is evidently unable to be rectified alonside anticipation of likely decline in tree health due to previous hefty reduction",
