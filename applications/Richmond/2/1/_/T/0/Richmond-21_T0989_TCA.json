As you can see from the attached photos, both trees have seeded themselves on the boundary fence in between buildings and are now growing out of the footings of the fence line. Previously these trees have been heavily pollarded and are not great specimens. As you will see from the sketch the garden is stocked well with other more suitable shrubs and trees in good positions. We are keen to remove and replace with a more suitable tree for the size of the garden.",
