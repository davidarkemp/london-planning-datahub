  "description": "Golden Cypress (T1) - fell because of shading of garden, excessive needle drop and to allow replanting of a hedge along the west boundary of the property\rLawsons Cypress (T2) - fell because of shading of garden, excessive needle drop and to allow replanting of a hedge along the west boundary of the property\rPLEASE NOTE: To our knowledge, neither of these trees (T1&T2) are subject to a TPO.  All trees relating to TPO 103 (from 1974) had been removed from the site by 1994 - it seems council records have not been updated.\r\rTo offset the loss of habitat we plan to replant the location of the trees (west boundary) with semi-mature hedging (c.8 linear metres).  We will also plant a semi-mature tree (Cherry Blossom) to the North East corner of the plot to provide screening for privacy and security.  \r\rIf the council wishes to place a TPO on any trees in the gardens should they feel we are removing trees of importance, we would suggest placing a TPO on the magnolia (T6) in the front garden which is a great mature specimen.",
