  "description": "@ x Pseudo Acacia Robinia Trees at the front of my property . They are very large (now about 25 years old). They overhang the road and are loosing dead branches which is typical of the age of this species. They are also now close to my house and the branches are too close to windows and guttering . I propose pruning and trimming the trees, cutting out dead wood and keeping them in a better shape , as per the email from my arborist .",
