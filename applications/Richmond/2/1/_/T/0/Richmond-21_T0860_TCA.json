  "description": "Holly: plan to trim or remove altogether as the tree is lopsided, inclining towards the house and untidy. If removed, it would be replaced with a new tree. An initial survey by a tree surgeon has suggested the tree will become a hazard given its top heavy nature and inclination, and could fall onto the property, favouring removal.  Replacements would be likely to be selected from a small magnolia, lilac or apple tree, but the space would be filled as soon as possible, if trimming is deemed insufficient. If trimmed, we would reduce the tree height by roughly 2 metres and seek to make it smaller and more even.  \r\rIf written confirmation is required from a tree surgeon over the tree's status as a future hazard, please advise.",
