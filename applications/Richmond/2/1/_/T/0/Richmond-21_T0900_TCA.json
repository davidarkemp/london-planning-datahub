  "description": "Birch tree - fell because the tree has grown much too large for the site.  It is located in the rear of number 11 Martindale close to our boundary fence and is very over-bearing with branches hanging about halfway across our garden.  It creates overwhelming mess from falling seeds which sometimes affect my asthma and makes eating outside difficult.  The tree cannot be seen from the street so is of low amenity value for the neighbourhood.  We would very much like to plant a new tree in our garden of an appropriate size for the garden space.",
