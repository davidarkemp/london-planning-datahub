Fell to ground level due to sever lean pushing against rear boundary fence recently replaced by St Pauls School.\rThe tree has a caused damage to the raised bed and patio as the lean continues to get worse and it is now resting on the newly installed fence. \rThe concern is that it will fail through the fence and into the school. The school has recently planted a very large number of trees along the same boundary which are being stifled by the ever looming Silver Birch.",
