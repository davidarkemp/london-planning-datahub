  "description": "Lebanon Cedar (rear garden)\rLarge prominent tree with evidence of extensive previous works. Central trunk / stem not present (storm damage / previous pruning)\r\rSuggest: \r\rThin crown / branch ends by 20-25% to create an even density of crown throughout. \rReduce crown all round by 2-2.5m and balance. Prune to suitable points of regrowth. \rRemove deadwood, stubs and crossing branches.\r\rAt present I estimate the tree to be around 20-22m in height and 20 m width. Once the pruning works have been completed it will be 19-20m in height and 19m laterally. The works are within BS3998 I believe, \r",
