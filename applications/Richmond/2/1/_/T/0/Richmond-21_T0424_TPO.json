  "description": "Reduce the crown/ canopy by up to 2 meters (particularly where it is unbalanced towards the property) and lift the crown branches at the base of the tree by 1.5 meters. This will take the tree from c. 15mtrs height canopy, 15mtrs wide and 18mtrs deep, to approximately 12-13mtrs height canopy, 12-13mtrs wide and 15mtrs deep. See attached photos to explain. \rThis is a large tree and needs to be looked after as many dead branches are falling in recent light winds. As it has been many years since last cut, the branches are now hanging over adjoining properties gardens (so all neighbours at #24, #28 and #71) and us would like to maintain the tree but allow more light and have less branches & debris falling into gardens. The tree is also unbalanced towards the house (not in a dangerous way) so we would like to improve the shape.",
