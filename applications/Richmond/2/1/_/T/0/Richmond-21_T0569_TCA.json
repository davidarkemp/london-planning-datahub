  "description": "Cedar - Four yea rs ago, tree was pruned as the crown was getting dense and obscuring light from a neighbour's garden at no. 25. It is now in need of a similar treatment for the same reason.The maximum spread of the cedar tree is 10m diameter and I propose this be reduced to 9m - The height I estimate is 20m and I propose this be reduced to 18m.\rThe spread begins at around 6m up and it roundly tapers in the shape of a fir cone to the top.",
