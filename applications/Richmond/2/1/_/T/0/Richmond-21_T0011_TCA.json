  "description": "Saucer Magnolia (T3) under TPO5270484. The work involves crown reduction and a shortening of the lower limbs. Some higher branches hit the upper walls of 107A and 109 Park Road in high winds, so the tree requires reshaping with appropriate crown reduction. The work is similar to the work carried out in 2014.\rcrown reduction averaging 2-3 metres would return a good and healthy shape back to the magnolia, as in some places the branches have grown excessively and are starting to look rather too lanky. The lower branches are also starting to strike the houses at 107A and 109 Park Road. A small number of lower branches may need cutting back by up to 3 metres in order to retain the balance to this fine tree.",
