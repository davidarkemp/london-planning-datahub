The tree has grown substantially since it was last pollarded and is causing excessive shade to the property and to the neighbouring property (109).I propose reducing the crown height and width by around 5.3mtrs so that it is 0.7mtrs high and wide. This is less of a reduction than the previous two times when it was reduced back to the original pollard cut.",
