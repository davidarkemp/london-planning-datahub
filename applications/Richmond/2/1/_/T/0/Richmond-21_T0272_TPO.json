  "description": "Planned works: Fell the holly tree. Following the high winds earlier this month the tree has tilted further and become dangerous. Given the height of the tree and the angle of current lean which looks to be closer to 30 degrees, this poses a safety concern especially as we have young children who use both gardens. We would propose replacing the tree with what the council would prefer, but given this tree was also crowding out the neighbours Robinia, and casting shade across our neighbours at no.16, we would propose something with a naturally sparser canopy such as a Magnolia. It is also worth highlighting that this tree is not visible from a public place as is in the back garden of the property, which backs onto others, and hence has limited public amenity.\r\rAfter consultation with neighbours at 16 Glebe road, they fully support the application.",
