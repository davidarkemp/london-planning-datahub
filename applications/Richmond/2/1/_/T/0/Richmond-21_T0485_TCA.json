  "description": "This is a tree at the back of the garden of our next door neighbours number 3 Chislehurst Road, the tree is very close to the boundary wall. The tree has not been pruned since we've been living here (6years) and it's overhanging a lot on our side over our parking area creating a lot of work during autumn when the leafs fall. In spring and summer our cars are completely covered in bird poop so we would like to trim the tree a little bit on our side only.\rPrune Crown by 2.5m on south and west sides (those parts which overhang the site) to create new crown radius of 4.5m on these sides. This will be from previous pruning points from past pruning. Crown lift to 8m over site.\r",
