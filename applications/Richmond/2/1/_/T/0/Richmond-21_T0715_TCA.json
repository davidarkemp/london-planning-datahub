  "description": "T1 - False Acacia - Large, mature false acacia growing in rear, right corner of rear garden\rProposed Works - a reduction in height of 3 to 4 metres, and then shaping lateral growth accordingly keeping but managing the current shape and image. Tree is to be lifted to 3.5 metres to provide clearance above garden and footpath and any laterals within 2 metres of neighbouring building cut back to provide clearance also. Any deadwood to be removed and a visual inspection of the crown to be undertaken to ensure integrity of larger limbs. Plan for tree made in conjunction with resident who is very keen to maintain the tree and ensure health, longevity and amenic value. T1 is approximately 22m in height with a spread of approx. 16m. Plan is to reduce height by approx. 4m leaving a height of 18m and reduce the spread by 2m all round leaving a spread of 12m. Tree is to be lifted to 3m above the pavement.",
