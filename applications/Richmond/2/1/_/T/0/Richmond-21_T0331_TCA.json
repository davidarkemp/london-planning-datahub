  "description": "remove x2 Holly trees in our garden at our cost to conform with the conservation area guidance. The reasons for this request is primarily based on health and safety reasons, but also includes increasing light into the garden as no vegetation is able to grow around the base. These are further explained below:\r\r1. Our neighbours at number 4 have a new born baby and a young toddler, and feedback has surfaced that the sharp holly leaves are a danger for young children playing in their garden. The sharp Holly leaves which are deposited across the garden of number 3 and 4, which travel further when displaced with the wind, have high potential for inflicting serious injury and causing bodily harm. We have also experienced the same concerns with children and pets playing in our garden, where we have had to treat minor wounds. Removing these trees mitigates the health and safety risk observed. \r\r2. Both Holly trees which stand approximately 3.5 meters high, are negatively impacting the surrounding fauna. The light restriction coupled with a dominant circumference of 2 meters from the trunk/base, make it impossible for other plants to thrive. \r\rWe plan to replace the trees with boundary planting and shrubs which are non-hazardous and less dominant for surrounding species. \r\rThis application is for the removal of x2 Holly Trees at the specified address (Holly Tree 1 and Holly Tree 2 on the attached sketched diagram). The work will be carried out by a registered tree surgeon to ensure the works carried out will be safe and professional, considering safety and limiting any damage on surrounding fauna.",
