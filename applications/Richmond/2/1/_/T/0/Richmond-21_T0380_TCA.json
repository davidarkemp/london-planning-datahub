  "description": "T1\tCrataegus spp x 1 Hawthorn with heavy lean towards a glass greenhouse. No sign of heave on the root plate but major tree failure a real concern.\r\tThe client is keen to retain the tree as is has sentimental value. I propose that we reduce the overall canopy by 30%, equating to roughly 80-100cm all round and a thin. This will reduce the sail effect when the tree comes into full leaf and will prolong the life of the tree. Going forward the client may wish to think about bracing the trunk, but we will wait to see how the reduction goes. This tree is DANGEROUS and may very soon cause damage to property. This tree is a DDD",
