  "description": "T1 Tree of Heaven: Fell to ground level \r\rJustification - \r\rDamaging wall, \rRe planting with 14-16cm girth species - Liquidambar  \rWith the points raised within the formal objections and with the consideration of the growth habit and vegetative propagation methods of the Ailanthus altissima species has; it has been decided that enforcing the long term retention via confirmation of the provisional TPO but allowing an element crown size management via pruning would likely be an unreasonable course of action for the long term for the tree owner as species related  issues have a relatively high chance of occurring in the future - ie suckering / self-propagation in the wider rear garden. I confirm therefore that LBRuT will not be looking to confirm this provisional order and TPO protection will cease on/after 17/03/21.",
