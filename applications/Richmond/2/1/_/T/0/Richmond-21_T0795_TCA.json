The tree has not be maintained over the years and is now carrying alot of weight within it and we have broken branches within the tree that will need removing along with the pollarding. We suggest to pollard this to to encourage a strong and healthy tree with a long term view of retaining it. Given its proximity to the building (The 60 flats within The Grove) and other houses we would suggest these works go ahead as soon as possible.",
