  "description": "Back Garden (Back Boundary)\rT1: Willow tree - Reduce height by 3 - 4m  to a pollard, reduce sides by 3 - 4m leaving some of the ingrowth to form a smaller canopy \rReasons for work: \rWe recently attended an emergency call-out when the tree dropped a limb over the footpath. There is a large cavity facing the footpath where the broken limb was situated. There is also some included bark in the upper canopy, which was spotted when we carried out a climbing inspection. Our works will relieve weight from the upper canopy as a preventative measure for any further failure, as the wind can be very strong at certain times of the year.  \rCurrent height 15m and spread 11m. Reduce height to 11m and spread 8m.",
