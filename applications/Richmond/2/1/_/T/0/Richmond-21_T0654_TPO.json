The tree was last reduced by 30% in 2010, and prior to that in 2005 was reduced by 50%, therefore given the 11 years of growth, it now dominates & shades the back of ours and no.16s garden. The tree is also on a 30 degree angle already, so combined with the increased height is becoming dangerous.",
