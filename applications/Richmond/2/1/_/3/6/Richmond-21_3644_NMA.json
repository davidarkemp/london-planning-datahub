  "description": "Non-material amendment to planning permission 21/3644/HOT - The original application included new metal frame Crittall style glazed doors to the rear (East) elevation. The proposal is now for painted timber framed doors. The central first floor doors on this elevation are now a casement window due to this room being a bathroom. The glass balustrade on the approved drawing has been changed to a more traditional painted cast iron. The dormers have been amended from slate cladding to lead cladding.",
