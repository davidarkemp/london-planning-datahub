  "description": "I own the house and live here with my brother and our elderly mother. It is our home. I also support animal rescue and have done for 30 years from this address. I take in small animals that are difficult to find homes for elsewhere due to specialist husbandry, behavioural or medical needs. \r\rThe garage (attached to the house) is used to house my rats and mice, they have lived in this garage since 2005 and before this they lived in a bedroom. I have been keeping a number of small animals in this house as pets since 1992. They live in cages/enclosures inside the rooms, their housing meets more than the minimum requirements listed in the guidance given by DEFRA and the RSPCA.\r\rThere is currently one aviary in the garden which houses 10 unreleasable feral pigeons. This has been there since July 2018 and is maintained/sponsored by Starlight Trust (https://starlighttrust.org.uk/)\r\rWe currently have two dogs and two guinea pigs living inside the house.\r\rI am applying for this certificate because I wish to replace a wooden outbuilding (a shed) that used to be used to house rats in cages, but now is used to store unused animal cages. The shed is quite dilapidated now. In the place of this shed I wish to build an aviary structure with a solid roof to house grey squirrels. I have applied for an IAS A01 license to keep grey squirrels from a London squirrel rescue called Urban Squirrels (who are already licensed). Natural England Wildlife Licensing Service have requested solid written confirmation from the planning officer in respect to the squirrels only. I contacted the Senior Planning Officer who requested I apply for a Certificate of Lawfulness.\r\rThe enclosure for the squirrels is the only outbuilding being built, and it is replacing a shed that has been on the property since 2002. I am not opening to the public. I am not a rescue centre. I need the Certificate of Lawfulness to specifically state that I have permission from the council to keep grey squirrels on my propert...",
