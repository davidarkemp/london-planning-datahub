  "description": "T1 Eucalyptus - fell\rThis tree is currently 13m high and 5m wide. It has been heavily reduced on several occasions in the past, resulting in fastigiate stress growth. It has developed a fungal bracket near the base of the main trunk (probably Ganoderma applamatum) which has increased in size on my second visit a few weeks later. Another smaller fruiting fungi has appeared on another part of the trunk since then too. I am applying to fell the tree but I would prefer to reduce to the previous reduction points, a height reduction of 4m",
