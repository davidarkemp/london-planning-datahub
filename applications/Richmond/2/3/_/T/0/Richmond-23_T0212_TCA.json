  "description": "I am applying to fell an apple tree in my garden. I am in the process of doing a ground floor extension and to get planning permission I had a tree survey done. The tree survey noted that. 'The physiological health is fair but in decline with an estimated contribution of less than 10years' \rOrchard Apple grows on the north boundary between 303 and 305. The stem leans through the fence into 305 then back into 303 with a canopy that is dominant in rear garden of 303. . It has been surveyed as a BS category U due to its poor structural condition with decay fungus present on stem. The physiological health is fair but in decline with an estimated contribution of less than 10 years. The north side of the canopy has been pruned back to the stem resulting in an unbalanced form. The proposed development in 303 may impact a small proportion of the RPA via excavations for foundations on the rear elevation.",
