The wall is cracked, falling down and needs to be rebuilt. The oak tree we wish to remove sits bang up against the original wall (see picture) and it has clearly outgrown its' position and caused the damage to the wall in question. In order to ensure that the new wall does not crack and become damaged in the same way, we are requesting to remove the tree.",
