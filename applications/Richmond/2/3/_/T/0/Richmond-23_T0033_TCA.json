  "description": "T1 Olive to be retained  \r\rT3 Bay Fell to ground level \r\r- The silver birch has some dieback at the top already.\r- Trees requiring cyclical pruning to prevent direct damage, and inadequate space to allow the trees to reach their mature size.\r- It is difficult to prune the silver birch due to the characteristics of its form and as a result of pruning the form is poor\r- The bay tree is inappropriate for the garden as it has grown quickly, no root barriers were ever used and logistically cannot be installed now. It is clearly pushing on the remaining wall, you can see that it is bowed, creating a risk that it too collapses. \r- The wall cannot easily be rebuilt whilst the trees are in situ. \r- The trees cannot be seen from the public unless looking down the alleyway of the property and as such the amenity value of the trees is very low\r- Replacement trees would be more appropriate for the garden and root barriers would be used if necessary. \r- The loss of the trees will be mitigated by the replanting of new and more appropriate trees to leave a long lasting legacy (please see design plan and mitigation strategy) \r\rGiven the life expectancy and condition of the trees the replacement of the trees will enhance the garden and improve the amenity\r\rPlease note, the address is 13 Onslow Road, Richmond TW10 6QH. The property used to be 11a. The planning portal have not updated",
