  "description": "TPO TT011 Tilia.  On the boundary line of 9/10 Beaulieu Close, TW1 2JR & 36 Denton Road, TW1 2HQ.\rCurrent height - circa 40ft (12m)\rCurrent span - circa 20ft (6m)\rProposing to reduce the crown height by circa 10ft (3.5m) and the lateral branches by circa 3ft (1m). The tree has severe decay in the crown and this is also evident in the main stem 2 meters from ground level. The proposed reduction is to minimise the weight in the crown to reduce the risk of the tree failing.\r\rRemoval of upper decaying limbs, thereby reducing the crown height as identified in the attached photographs.  Reduction of remaining limbs so that the tree remains balanced and aesthetically pleasing.\r\rProfessional, qualified advice and report given by Aaron Barclay in December 2022 (Woodfellers Arboricultralists,  \rWebsite: Woodfellers.uk, Mobile 07771 395 717)\r\r'.....there is severe decay in the crown and this is also evident in the main stem, 2 meters from ground level.\rWhilst climbing the tree there was more movement than usual in the centre stem, suggesting that the heart wood is not completely healthy.\rWe would suggest heavily reducing the tree to minimise the weight in the crown and limit the risk of the tree failing.\rIn the image attached I have drawn red circles highlighting the main decay in the crown (photos attached to this application). The yellow highlight is where I suggest the crown is reduced to, with the large limb over the garden to be removed. The rest of the lateral limbs should be reduced/pollarded holistically to maintain good shape'",
