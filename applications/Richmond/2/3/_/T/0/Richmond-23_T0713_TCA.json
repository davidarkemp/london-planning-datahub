We thing that the work is necessary as trees are way too tall and blocks all the sunlight to the block of flats behind and creates a lot of mess to all their sheds and gardens.\r* Remove fell young Leylandii tree T2 ( not looking in great health as its overshadowed by the others and doesn't get much sunlight.  \r* Remove young Ash sapling T6 (self seeded and in the wrong place) \r* Reduce height of Sweet Chestnut T5 by 1-2 metres and cut back branches away from the building.\rthe Leylandii tress (T1, T3,T4)  are approximately 15 metres tall, and we want to remove approximately 6 metres in height, leaving if at a height of 9 metres. Crown spread is approximately 6 metres wide;  we want to reduce it by 2.5 to 3 metres, leaving it with a spread of 3 to 3.5 metres wide. \r\rSweet chestnut (T5) is about 9 to 10 metres tall. We want to reduce the height by 1.5 to 2 metres, leaving a height of 8-9 metres. spread is approximately 3 metres wide. And we just want to do a selective reduction on some limbs that are touching the building. \r",
