The woodland gardens around the cottage are currently being restored, with an accent on the removal of non-native species such as rhododendron. \rThe Lawsons Cypress 14KH and Leylandii hedge 14KK identified here are to be felled are species inconsistent with the predominantly native planting of the Woodland Gardens. \rPlanting of native species is currently underway throughout the woodland gardens as part of its restoration and improvement.\rAdditionally, 14KK is a grown-out hedge feature which is very close to a building and may damage the foundations in due course.\r",
