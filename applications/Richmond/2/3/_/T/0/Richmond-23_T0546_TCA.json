  "description": "An invasive Bay Tree that has previous grown through the garden wall needs regular pruning. We would like to prune it back after several years of growth - The tree is approximately 5-6m tall and 450cm wide. So a 20% reduction would leave the crown with a diameter of 360 and total height reduction of approximately 45-80cm\rOur tree surgeon, Chris McGregor at 1stclasstreeservices recommends a 20% crown reduction.",
