  "description": "T1 - Mimosa Tree - Crown reduction of 1.5-2m \r\rThis will leave a final height of approx 5m and a spread of approx 4m.\r\rThis tree/main stem has noticably moved towards an outbuilding. One Large Limb is currently all of 1 inch away from the building itself, however it is already pushing on the guttering.\rRequest to remove this limb to provide space between the tree and the outbuilding. Also to reduce the crown of this tree by approx 1.5 - 2.0m to reduce weight to hopefully stop any further movement towards the building, with a view to the tree re-growing/re-forming a balanced crown. Hopefully with these works the tree can be retained longterm as it provides good screening between properties.",
