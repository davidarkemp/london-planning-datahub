  "description": "Single Ash tree in rear garden of 6 Watcombe Cottages (it is the only tree in the garden). Requesting permission to pollard the Ash tree to manage growth/size, reduce shade/overhang for me and neighbours and promote tree health. Main trunk of tree is approx 20ft high. Would be trimming back to previous pollarding points at the top of the main trunk. Tree is a common Ash, so do not believe it has a preservation order on it, but our property is in a Conservation area.",
