  "description": "The tree which i should like to remove is a Norwegian maple tree-  It does not have a TPO.\rIt grows between an oak tree in my neighbours garden and a horse chestnut in my garden.  \rIt therefore has low amenity value.  - I should like to remove the tree completely including stump removal.  \rIn terms of replacement it is my intention to replace by planting a number of pleated trees along a border with neighbouring garden - this is identified on my document.  Something like a Japanese privet which has all year leaves and has good carbon and pollution absorption but I am happy to take some advice on this from you if a more indigenous local species is preferred.  \rPlease note that I am making the application, however I fully intend to have the work carried out by a local, arborist.",
