  "description": "The tree is a magnolia as indicated by the word 'Magnolia' on the sketch. The canopy is to be reduced by no more than 2m and the width to approximately 5m. The aim is to thin the sprouts and focus on the main points of growth in the canopy.tree is currently approximately 7m high and the canopy 5m wide at the widest points. The aim is to thin the sprouts so that the canopy is no more than 5 m wide (virtually no reduction of width but if any reduction takes place it should be no more than 2m) and some branches will be reduced by up to 2 metres in height but leaving the overall height largely unchanged. A professional tree surgeon (The Tree Company) will be employed to ensure that the appropriate shape and principal growth points are retained for the tree species.",
