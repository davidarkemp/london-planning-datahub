  "description": "Maple Tree (T2) - remove this tree as it's growing at an angle and is at risk of falling. The tree has been staked in the past but this has failed to rectify the issue.\rBeech Trees (T3, T4 & T5) - remove these trees as they are blocking light from the lower ground floor, as well as the flats next door. We would like to replace with screening trees, such as 'red robins' on trellis framework. \rWe will use a professional tree surgeon to do the work.",
