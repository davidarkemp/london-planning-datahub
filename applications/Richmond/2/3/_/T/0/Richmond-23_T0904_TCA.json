  "description": "One  medium sized golden plum tree which is now diseased and mainly dead which the tree surgeon has said is a danger to life as it is leaning to the right and is very wobbly. One big left branch broke off earlier this year, fortunately when no one was there, after a strong wind. It now has one main branch on the right hand side which is why it is leaning. There are a few small branches which are mainly dead. It has recently started leaning across my back gate and I can no longer open it. The bark is coming away from the trunk exposing a diseased inner which is being eaten. It looks like a crumbly honeycomb. The tree has not produced edible fruit for the twenty years I have lived here despite my attempts to help it by applying grease bands twice a year. The tree surgeon will cut it down to its base. He was very clear that this should be done soon to prevent any injury should it fall before work was done.\rI have already planted another plum tree in a different part of the garden.",
