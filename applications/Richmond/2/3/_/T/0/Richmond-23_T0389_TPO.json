The dimensions of the 're-growth branches' varies according to position in the crown, with some extending further than others from previous pruning points - a maximum growth extension is 3m in length.  Therefore, the maximum extent of height reduction proposed is 3m, leaving a finished height of 22m AGL and the maximum extent of lateral branch reduction is 3m, leaving a finished crown spread of 12m across.",
