  "description": "T1 - Ornamental Cherry - Remove to ground level. The tree is in decline and being overshadowed by T2 (Birch). Clients would like to remove tree and replant another tree of a similar size in a better position within the garden. Current height is 3 meters with 2 meter span.\rT2 - Silver Birch - Remove 2 lower limbs, lift crown to 4 meters from ground height and thin crown by 15%. Both lower limbs are interfering with neighbours property/wall and need to be removed to avoid any damage. Thin crown to promote healthy growth and increase airflow, removing any deadwood. Current height is 10m, current span is 4m. \rT3 - Magnolia - Lift branches which hang over pub garden and car park to 4 meters from ground height so they are away from the property boundary wall and the pub's (The Crown - located behind property) bin area. Lift east side of crown (side closest to property) by removing 2 lowest branches to suitable growth points. The removal of the lower limbs on both sides of the tree will be considered to ensure a natural shape of the tree is maintained. Remove suckers throughout the crown to promote healthy growth. Current height is 10m, current span is 8m.",
