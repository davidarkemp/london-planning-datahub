  "description": "T1 - Horse Chestnut. Approx. 18m in height with a 12m lateral spread.\r\rProposed Works: Due to cavities identified in recent works, weight reduction to be carried out on 2 large lateral limbs growing out over neighbouring property. Work to reduce the risk of limbs failing and damaging neighbouring structure and will leave the tree balanced. Approx 3 to 4m to be taken from these two lower limbs only which we leave the height the same at 18m and the lateral spread at 11m due to the rest of the tree having no work carried out. \r\rT2 - Leylandii. Approx 8m in height with a 3m lateral spread. \r\rProposed Works: Remove and grind stump. Due to previous topping of tree little value left in overgrown leylandii hedge with poor and dense regrowth\r\rT3 - Leylandii.
