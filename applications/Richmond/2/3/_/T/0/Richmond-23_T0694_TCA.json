  "description": "Bay tree at end of garden of 39 Berwyn Road adjacent to garden of 23 Orchard Rise. This Bay tree is approx. 9m high and 7.5m wide. We wish to remove 0.5m in height and 1m in width (0.5m off each side) from the crown to maintain shape and limit overshadowing. This will leave a tree approx. 8.5m high and 6.5m wide which will be more in balance as it currently looks too wide and uneven. You will note from previous applications that we need to trim this tree every few years to keep it in shape.",
