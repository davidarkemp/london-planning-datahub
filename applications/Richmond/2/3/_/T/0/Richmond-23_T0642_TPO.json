  "description": "TPO T1029 at Home Park House, Hampton Court Road, Kingston, KT1 4AE. Removal of London Plane tree. The tree has long been dangerous due to large branches falling, risking injuring people below.  It has also been undermining foundation of house for years.  In the last few years, it has also been underminining the boundary wall, belonging to Hampton Court Palace, with brick coming away and now whole wall leaning, to the extent that we have had to cordon off an area of garden for safety.  Now Historic Royal Palaces, who manage the wall, have determined that the historic wall cannot be preserved while the tree is in situ.  They have asked that it be removed, so they may then make the necessary rebuilding.",
