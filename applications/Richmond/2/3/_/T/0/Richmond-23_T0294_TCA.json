  "description": "T1 - False acacia - Mature Robinia situated on the corner of Cambrian road and Grove road. Tight union at approx. 3.5-4m where lateral branch originated from main trunk, with faint signs of a crack forming.\r\rEvidence of dieback in the upper crown with a sparse crown and deadwood. There's more than 3 branch stubs from previously snapped branches and a hanging branch in the tree. \r\rRecommendations - Reduce all aspects of crown crown by approx. 3-3.5m, remove deadwood and hanging branches. Reduce lower lateral branch by approx. 3m and thin by 20% to reduce weight on branch tips and chance of failure. (Application made as a 5 day DDD due to the dangerous state of the tree).\t\r\rStarting height - 19m - Starting spread - 9m\rFinished height - 16m - Finished spread - 6m\r\r\r1\tT2\tCaucasian Wingnut\tReduce all aspects of crown by approx. 1.5-2m. Reduce overextended limb back by approx. 3-3.5m back into shape and Sever section of Ivy to promote tree health.\r\rStarting height - 9m - Starting spread 4m\rFinished height - 7-7.5m - Finished spread 3m",
