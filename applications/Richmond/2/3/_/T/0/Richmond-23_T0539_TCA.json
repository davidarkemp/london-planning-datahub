  "description": "Three large sycamore trees next to the rear boundary of the property which are identified as A1, A2 and A3. Tree A3 has had significant bark stripping by grey squirrels which has caused branches to become weak and prone to falling in high winds. The trees need to have the damaged branches managed by a tree surgeon to avoid damage to neighbors property and potential injury by falling on someone. From the ground there are three large limbs which can be seen that appear to have large areas of stripped bark with evidence of rotting of the inner part of the wood. Several large branches have already fallen. Due to the height the tree surgeons will need ropes to access and fully assess and remove diseased branches. It is estimated that any work will not reduce the over all width and may reduce the height by 2-3 meters at the maximum.  The heights of the trees are marked on the sketch map included.",
