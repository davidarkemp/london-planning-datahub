  "description": "Horse Chestnut\r\rProposed work: The large low lateral bough is to be reduced by 10 metres, cutting to a growth point at c. two metres from the main stem\r2) The reduction of the two limbs on the northerly side of the crown which are impinging upon the adjacent Robinia, and which are to be reduced by  seven metres, would result in the overall crown spread of the Chestnut being reduced by  three metres to c. 18 metres\r3) The overall height of the Chestnut would not be reduced\r\r\rReasons: the large low lateral limb will collapse, causing considerable damage, unless heavily reduced. The two limbs extending into the adjacent Robinia are structurally sound. However they are severely impairing the Robinia, which is a long-term tree in contrast to the Chestnut, which is in decline.",
