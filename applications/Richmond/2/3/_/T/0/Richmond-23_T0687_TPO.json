Pruning is proposed to reduce Crown by 25% \rRemove lowest hanging secondary branches back to previous points to reduce excessive shading of the house and prevent lowest hanging branches from restricting movement along pavement outside the garden - creating up to 2.5m clearance from building. \rCrown lift secondary branches to create up to 3.5m clearance from ground",
