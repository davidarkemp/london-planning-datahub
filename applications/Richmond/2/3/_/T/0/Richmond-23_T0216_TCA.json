  "description": "T1 - Camellia japonica as shown on attached topographical survey and photograph. Reduce crown height by 1.8m and width by 2.3m (cut back towards fence). Plant has not been appropriately pruned for some time and is sprawling. Final width1.75m and 2.00m height.\r\rT2 - Camellia japonica as shown on attached topographical survey and photograph. Reduce crown height by 1m and width by 2.3m (cut back towards fence). Plant has not been appropriately pruned for some time and is sprawling. Final width 1.75m and 2.00m height.\r\rT3 - Holly (Ilex Aquifolium) as shown on attached topographical survey and photograph. Reduce crown height by 2m, width on south side by 2m and other sides by 0.5m. Raise crown to achieve 2m clearance from the ground. Crown is lopsided and the tree is crowding an adjacent cherry plum causing it to lean. Final width 5m and 7m height\r\rT4 & T5 - Thuja plicata x 2 as shown on attached topographical survey and photograph. Fell and grind out stump as trees are close to property causing structural risk, cause dense shading and are of low ecological and amenity value. Propose to replant with 3x silver birch to improve ecological value.\r\rT6 - Viburnum tinus as shown on attached topographical survey and photograph. Reduce crown height by 2.5m and width by 1m (cut back towards fence). Plant has not been appropriately pruned for some time and is sprawling. Final width 1.50m and 2.25m height",
