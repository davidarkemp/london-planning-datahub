An arborist was consulted who confirmed that the entire tree is sadly dead. Our concern is obviously safety as the prime consideration for the 2 adjoining gardens (1 to the rear & 1 to the side). We have no option other than to fell on his recommendation. There is no TPO but Royal Road is in a conversation area.",
