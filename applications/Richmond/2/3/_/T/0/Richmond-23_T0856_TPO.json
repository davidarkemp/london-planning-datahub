  "description": "T1 (tag 74) Sophora japonica branches are over extended over the road and garages. This has been discussed with the Arboricultural Department previously. The tree canopy is open and poorly structured, leaving it exposed to wind movement and loading. In order to prevent limb loss and structural damage and retain the tree, it is proposed to reduce the canopy structure by 2m. leaving a balanced crown. The adjacent Ailanthus T2 (Tag 75) will be reduced as the have co-joined crowns. This will allow  regrowth to leave balanced future crown and reduce the potential for the tips to break out on the Ailanthus. Reason for works is to reduce the overbearing nature of the trees and safety, to reduce the potential wind sail of the crown. The final height of both trees will be 18m, with the co-joined crowns being no less than 10m from the trunk at all cardinal points and dependent on suitable growth points. The point of the reduction is to leave a balanced crown, and to prevent future branch failures due to over extension and prevent damage to adjacent buildings and roofs.",
