Due to the poor health of the tree, it is likely to drop dead wood over a well-used road and open area. \r\rT2 Carpinus (Hornbeam) Tag 35746 - Fell to ground level for health and safety reasons. This tree is  multi-stemmed just above a decay area at the base which is creating a weak structure. The tree is in a well-used open area and has the potential for failure in bad weather.",
