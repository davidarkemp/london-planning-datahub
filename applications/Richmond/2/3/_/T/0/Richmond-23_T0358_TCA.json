  "description": "Carefully section fell to ground level one dying Lawson Cypress tree (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), situated at the entrance to Byron Garages.\rCarefully section fell to ground level one dying Lawson Cypress tree situated adjacent to Shelley Court.\rCarefully section fell to ground level one dead Mimosa tree (Acacia dealbata), situated adjacent to Pope Court.\rT5: Maple; Carefully prune away from the building to give a 1mt clearance post reduction. The current estimated crown spread of this tree is 8mts. The estimated crown spread post reduction will be 7mts.\rT98: False Acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia); Carefully section fell to ground level this dying tree.\rT109: Wild Cherry (Prunus avium); Carefully remove all major deadwood.\rG156: Cherry Laurel Shrubs; Carefully reduce in height by 1-2mts.  The current estimated crown height of this group of shrubs is 6mts. The estimated height post reduction will be 4mts.\rT218: Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara); Carefully reduce and reshape by 2-4mts overall to help prevent any further branch failure. The current estimated crown height and spread of this tree is 26mts & 18mts. The estimated crown height & spread post reduction will be 22mts & 14mts.\rThis tree has suffered two large limb failures in the space of 12 months. The proposed overall crown reduction is to help prevent any further large limb loss thus protecting the people and property using the space below the tree and helping to prevent further main stem wounds caused by large limbs tearing out.",
