The plan would be to reduce the height by one third and shape the tree, reducing the width. The current dimensions are as follows:\rHeight - 7 metres, Spread - 2.5 to 3.0 metres in all directions (ie, up to 6m across)\rThe target dimensions are as follows;\rHeight - 5 metres, Spread - 1.5 metres in all directions (ie. 3m across)\r\rT1 Silver Birch - to be shaped, the intention is not to reduce the height significantly just to shape and trimming the protruding branches. The current dimensions are as follows:\rHeight - 6-7 metres, Spread - 1.5 to 2.0 metres in all directions \rThe target dimensions are as follows;\rHeight - 6-7 metres, Spread - 0.8 metres (ie. 1.6 metres across)\r\rT2 Red Tree - Reduce - The current dimensions are as follows;\rHeight - 6-6.5 metres Spread (see compass points in sketch above\rWest - 2.5 metres\rSouth - 2.0 metres\rEast - 1.5 metres\rNorth - 0.5 metres (cut back level with the boundary)\rThe target dimensions are as follows:\rHeight - 4.5 - 5.0 metres\rSpread - 1.5 metres (West, South & East)\r\rT3 Olive - Reduce AND TO be shaped and thinned to ensure the weight is distributed more evenlyThe current dimensions are as follows;\rHeight - 5 metres,Spread (see compass points in sketch above\rWest - 0.8 metres\rSouth - 1.5 metres\rEast - 1.5 metres\rNorth - 0.5 - 0.75 metres (cut back level with the boundary)\rThe target dimensions are as follows;\rHeight - 3.5 - 4.0 metres, Spread - 0.8 metres (West, South, East)\r\rT4 - Silver Birch - to reduce the height also to reduce the number of branches overhanging the neighbours garden, particularly those at a lower level - \rThe current dimensions are as follows; Height - 6 metres, Spread - 1.5 to 2.0 metres\rThe target dimensions are as follows: Height - 4 metresSpread - 0.8 metres",
