  "description": "We have a row of 5 robinia trees between our property (Mullion) and Parkland House next door. We are applying to have these pruned back by 25% as they are becoming very tall and are taking out light from the neighbours windows. The height of the trees is around 10 metres, including trunk of around 6 metres and crown of 4 metres, canopy spread of 2.5 metres\rThe applica&on is to reduce the height of the crown by 2.5 metres, and reduce the spread of the canopy by 0.5 metres\rThe remaining dimensions of the trees would be height of 7.5 metres, crown of 1.5 metres, canopy spread of 2.25 metres",
