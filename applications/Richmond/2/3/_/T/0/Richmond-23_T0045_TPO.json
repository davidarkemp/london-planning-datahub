  "description": "As last application when permission granted as follows 4 September 2019\rT1- Cedar - Reduce lateral growth by up to 1m (MAXIMUM) and crown thin outer canopy by 10-15% on the roadside of the tree. Reduce lateral spread by up to 2m ( MAXIMUM ) and crown thin outer canopy by 10-15% from the owners property and neighbouring property to allow space for outer canopy development. No height reduction is permitted with this specification.\rThe estimated height of the canopy/tree before pruning (now) is about 13 metres. The height of our house ( Number 4 Orchard Rise ) is about 11-12 metres. The estimated lateral spread of the canopy running parallel with the road and over both our property and Number 2 Orchard Rise is about 15 metres and the spread of the canopy running perpendicular to the road towards our house on one side and out over the road on the other side is about 13 metres.The proposed crown size/height of the tree after pruning we would estimate to be broadly the same  at about the current height ( allowing for some thinning of the green foliage ) with a spread/width of about 12 metres running parallel to the road and 11 metres running perpendicular to the road.",
