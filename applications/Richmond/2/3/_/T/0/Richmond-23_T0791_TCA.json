  "description": "T1 Is a semi mature lime tree (Tilia) which is planted adjacent to the boundary wall between Ensleigh Lodge and  23 Ham Common As a result approximately half of the crown approximately  5meters overhangs the garden of 23 Ham Common  and the branches extend over the roof of a single story extension and are now touching the rear elevation of  23 Ham Common  causing excessive shading. T1 tree has been pruned on a number of previous occasions resulting in a very dense crown.  The proposal would be to reduce the overhanging branches by between 1.2m &1.83M  this would leave a spread fro the trunk of  approx. 2.5-. 3m this would leave a to allow clearance from the rear elevation and prevent damage to the brickwork. There is another tree ( T3 to which NO works are proposed))  2 m further along the boundary so the spread is less in this direction and we would be removing rubbing and chaffing branches.  Reductions would then be made on the Eastleigh Lodge side of the boundary sufficient to create a balanced crown. So again approx1.8m leaving  2.5-3m of spread\rT2 Is a semi mature Yew tree (Taxus baccata) which is planted close the boundary wall to the rear of Ensleigh Lodge. It has been maintained as a rounded crown where the outer circumference has been trimmed repeatedly resulting in a very dense crown. The proposal would be to trim back the branches to their rounded shape removing approximately 1.8m leaving a spread of 2.5m from the trunk in all directions over the whole crown then to thin the crown so as to begin to reduce the density and introduce layering into the crown. This will allow more light into the centre and stimulate growth throughout the crown rather than just on the outer edge",
