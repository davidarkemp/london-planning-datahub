  "description": "I have a client (Brenda) who lives at 45 Rosemont Rd, TW10 6QN. She has a neighbouring oak tree (T1) belonging to 7 Queens Rd. \rThe tree in question is approx. 15m tall and 15m wide. The finished width of the tree will be approx. 12m wide. \rShe would like the lower branches that are encroaching in her garden to be cut back by up to 3 metres. This will be done to suitable growth points, cutting no wood larger than 500mm in diameter. \rThe neighbour would like a small low hanging branch removed too. I have included images of both in the application.",
