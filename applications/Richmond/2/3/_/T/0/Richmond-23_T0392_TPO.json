  "description": "The pine tree in question is marked Tree 1 pine on the plan. This application does not relate to Trees 2 and 3 which are also shown. The application only relates to Tree 1.\rThe spread of the tree canopy North to South running parallel to/alongside West Temple Sheen is approximately 15 meters. The spread of the canopy West to East is approximately 18 meters ( 4 meters overhanging to the centre of the road ). The height of the tree is approximately 30 meters.\rThe application is toReduce height of major crown stem to east by approximately 1 and a half metersReduce major crown stem to east away from church building to give 1 and a half meters clearance.\rReduce major crown stem to east where it overhangs No.13 W. Temple Sheen by 1and a half meters\rReduce the spread of main central crown stem to north by 1 and an half meters and south by 1 and a half metersRemove lowest branch to southwest at 7m\rRegarding height, the application is to reduce the height of the major crown stem to the east by 1 and a half meters thus reducing crown height from approximately 30 meters to approximately 29 meters.\rRegarding breadth, the application is to reduce the major crown stem to the east away from the church building to give 1 and a half meters clearance and where there is an overhang of No.13 W. Temple Sheen to reduce by 1 and a half meters. This would reduce the North-South canopy size by 2 and a half to 3  meters in total ( one and a half meters in each direction ) leaving canopy size at approximately 10 meters north to south. \rAlso, the application includes a reduction of the main central crown stem to the north by 1 and a half meters and the south by 1 and a half meters. This would have the same overall impact of reducing canopy size by 3 meters in total on the east to west axis. It is anticipated that the effect of the above application would be to reduce the canopy size west to east to approximately 15 meters.\rThe primary reason for the application is to provide a rea...",
