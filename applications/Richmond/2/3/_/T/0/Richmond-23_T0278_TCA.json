  "description": "There is a Robinia Frisia tree at the bottom of our garden (please see Sketch 1) which is in a poor state of health. It has been previously strapped and this is now strangling the tree. Having consulted Darryl Parkin at The Tree Agency, he has condemned the tree as unsafe due to severe lower trunk/root decay (please see photos 1-5). He has recommended that it be removed as soon as possible due to a possible safety risk. Once the tree has been removed we will replace it with a sizeable (3-4m) multi-stemmed Himalayan Birch.",
