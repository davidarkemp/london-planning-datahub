  "description": "T1 and T2 - oak -  The 2 trees are very close together, and the canopies have grown excessively - they are in the front garden of the property, in a small area between the pedestrian access lane and cottage. It is now cutting out necessary daylight to adjacent planting, properties and the lane. An approximate 50% reduction and reshaping of the tree canopy is proposed - 3m crown reduction in width and 2m reduction in height, leaving a canopy spread of 5m and height of 5m.",
