  "description": "We would like to remove the Ash tree in our garden. It obstructs light, sucks the moisture from the rest of the garden and is expensive to prune. We would like to totally remove the tree, it is situated at the bottom right hand corner of our garden ( when facing from the back of the house towards the rear fence bordering Alton Road. We do not plan to replace the tree, we already have other trees in the garden that will grow better without it, but would replace with srubs and a flower border.",
