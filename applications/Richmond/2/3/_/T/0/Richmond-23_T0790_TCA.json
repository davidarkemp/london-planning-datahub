  "description": "The proposal is to fell the Eucalyptus tree (T2) to ground level, grind out stump. Height 11m & spread 6m. Reduce height to 0m & spread to 0m\r\rThis application follows an application a year ago where the council agreed to the removal of a Robinia Tree but placed a provisional TPO on the Eucalyptus. The council decided against making the TPO permanent and allowed it to lapse in July. The council have also recently approved a planning application to build a garden room in the vicinity of the eucalyptus tree. The application stated clearly that the project involved removing the eucalyptus tree. The tree department made no objection to the application and it was approved by the council on Sept 14 2023.",
