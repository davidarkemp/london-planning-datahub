  "description": "Eucalyptus tree which has outgrown it's position.  It has been crown pruned by previous owners so a shaving brush effect can be seen at the top of the tree which has increased the leakage at the top of the tree which increases the danger of it's being blown down in a storm. If this happened it would hit our house and/or neighbours' houses.  This is a fast-growing tree who's root system is also a danger to nearby houses.  \rWe would like to cut the tree down to within 3 feet of the ground to allow it to re-grow from the base - into a shrubby tree which would be easier to look after.",
