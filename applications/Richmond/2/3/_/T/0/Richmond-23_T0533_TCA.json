  "description": "T1 - Magnolia Grandiflora - Fell to ground level due to proximity to house (1.05m at base) and advice of surveyor consulted on the matter that 'Root systems can have an adverse effect on structural stability and the removal would ensure that this is avoided in the future'. The neighbours at no.1 - part of the semi-detached structure - have also expressed concern about the potential adverse effect on structural stability and excessive shading. Furthermore, the tree is of low amenity value, is a non-native species and has caused some damage to the paving in the garden. Diameter is 28cm at height of 150cm, height estimated at 9m. Propose a replacement tree of native species to be planted in a more suitable location of the garden",
