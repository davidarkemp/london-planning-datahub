  "description": "T1- Robinia - Remove this tree. Mature Robinia tree situated on a sloped bank and less then 1m from building.\rThis tree really is in the wrong place and I recommend the full removal of this tree. Windows are entirely covered by foliage, branches are resting on the roof tiles and in the guttering. This shading will encourage damp in this area. The roots could cause the slope to erode and being so close to the building could cause structural issues if let to grow larger.\rA light reduction to this tree would encourage growth and a heavy reduction would cause the roots to throw out saplings around the garden.\rRemoval of tree and eco plug the stump recommended.\rThere is decay at the base of this tree working its way up through a wound approximately 2m high.",
