Magnolia (RHS of property) - Reduce back selected branch to suitable live growth. To be shown by client when on-site. Reduce branch to reinstate suitable clearance from overhead cables. Pre works 5x5m. Post works 5x4m.\r-3. Horse Chestnut (rear LHS of property) - Fell to leave 1.5m stump. Suppressed tree, removing competition to better adjacent trees and increase light into property. \r-4. Yew (rear LHS of property) - Crown Lift to provide 2.5m clearance from ground level and suitable clearance from roof.\r-5. Oak (LHS of property) - Crown Lift to provide 2m clearance from property roof, and maintain that canopy height around entire canopy. Approximately 4 established branches to be removed and multiple epicormic shoots.\r-6. Oak (front of property) - Reduce the height and spread of the tree by up to 2m back to previous pruning points. All pruning cuts shall be made to suitable secondary growth points and shall maintain a stable platform for the expected regrowth.\r-7. Oak (adjacent to mooring) - Leaning tree. Remove major deadwood greater than 25mm diameter, sever and remove ivy on trunk to expose lowest 1.5m and remove low historically cut back limb over water. To improve safety of tree over moored boats. \r-8. Dead tree (front of property) - Fell to leave 1.5-2m stump. Logs to be cut into manageable pieces and stacked neatly.\r-9. Holly (rear garden LHS) - Reduce height by 50% down to natural break in canopy. To smarten tree up and make regular trimming more manageable. Pre works 7m high. Post works 3.5m high. \r-10. Yew (rear garden LHS) - Reduce low laterals over log pile by up to 1.5m to encourage new internal growth.Lower canopy recently reduced heavily by BT contractors, our work is to tidy and blend in remaining canopy.",
