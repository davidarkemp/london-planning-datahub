  "description": "The tree is a female fruiting Ginkgo biloba,TPO2, (aka Maidenhair Tree) located at the front of the property (34 Ennerdale Road) between the drive and the path. It is an adult tree. \rThe low hanging branches of the tree are obstructing the path outside our property and our neighbours properties. We would like to Crown Lift the tree to a height of 2.5 metres where the branches are overhanging neighbouring properties or the public pathway.\rNote : the fruit of the tree is maturing quickly this year and we would appreciate if you would expedite the approval as soon as practically possible as the tree surgeon refers to the mature fruit as 'vomit inducing' and it will not be possible to do it when the fruit is ripe.",
