  "description": "Willow tree (T1) - Re-pollard at the knuckles/last pruning points representing a 30% reduction consistent with an application made previously and granted in 2017 and 2020. Willow tree has a height of approximately 15 metres and a width of approximately 7.5 metres.\rThe tree will be re-pollared and there should be no reduction in crown size\rWe have been advised by our household insurers and professional tree surgeon to have the willow tree reduced every three years due to the proximity to the house and the excessive shading that it creates.\rEucalyptus tree (T2) - The eucalyptus would be a crown reduction of 50% representing approximately a 6 metre reduction in size of the tree. The sides of the tree would be reduced by up to 3meters to ensure a nice rounded shape where possible. The application is consistent with an application made previously when the size of the tree was reduced and granted 17/T0394/TCA.",
