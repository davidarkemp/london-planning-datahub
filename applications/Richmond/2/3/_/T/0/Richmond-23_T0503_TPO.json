The branches are significantly growing over No. 33's rear garden. All works completed in accordance with BS3998:2010 standard - We are not reducing the crown height at all and it's not a whole crown reduction. The reduction is 2m from the property and therefore we could be bound by that and as the building isn't going to move anytime soon it's a more realistic measurement then an estimated crown spread.",
