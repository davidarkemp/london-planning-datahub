  "description": "T1 Horse chestnut - Over extended limb towards building requires weight reduction 5m. An overall weight reduction is also required. \rI propose to reduce the entire tree by 4 metres. Current height 22m, tree height will be 18m high. Width currently 20m, width will be left at 16m, depending on wether the extended limb is permitted to be reduced to 6m. If so the the width would result in being 14m Remove basal growth up to 6m.\r\rT2 Horse chestnut - Remove this tree. This smaller tree within the row has Rust spots from 2 metres upwards indicating Canker infection. There are the fruiting body remains of a further disease at the base of this tree which cannot be identified at this stage. With the tree being located over a busy footpath & road i recommend removal of this tree. (See photos)\r\rT3 Horse chestnut - An overall weight reduction is required. I propose to reduce the height and roadside branches tree by 4 metres. Current height 22m, tree height will be 18m high. Width currently 16m, width will be left at 12m. Remove basal growth up to 6m. (See Photos)\r\rT4 Horse chestnut - An overall weight reduction is required. I propose to reduce the entire tree by 4 metres. Current height 18m, tree height will be 14m high. Width currently 18m, width will be left at 14m. Remove basal growth up to 6m. There is also an area at the base of this tree which has the remains of fungal fruiting bodies but again the disease cannot be identified due to the advanced state of decay.\r\rT5 Horse chestnut - An overall weight reduction is required. I propose to reduce the entire tree by 8 metres. Current height 20m, tree height will be 12m high. Width currently 16m, width will be left at 8m. Remove basal growth up to 7m. The base has a large wound where compost has been built up over the years and bleeding canker is present on this tree. The weight is very one sided. The wall has shifted significantly and the road has been lifted due to the root damage.\r\rT6 Self sown Ash - Remove tree. this tree...",
