  "description": "Please see the attached drawing.  We would like remove the self seeded sycamore which is thin and dangerous in strong wind.  No other trees will be touched.  It is in our front garden between an established oak and sycamore.  There is approx 3 metres from the established sycamore to the proposed removal.  There is approx 4 metres between the oak to the proposed tree.  Can't see how to attach a drawing or photo.  Please let me know how to proceed.  Thank you.",
