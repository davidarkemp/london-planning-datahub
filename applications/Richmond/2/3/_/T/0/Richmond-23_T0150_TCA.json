Reason: Client states that the walls are being damaged at the base of the tree, sewage pipe work below has already been repaired once, and work to stabilise the house by underpinning has already been done in the past. The tree is beautiful, its proximity to the house and size even with it being trimmed regularly still reduces light and isn't getting any smaller so concerns with pipes and the house have not gone with getting it trimmed regularly. Client would plant a replacement Cherry or Apple tree further away from the house. \rT2 Leylandii (x1) - Fell to ground level. Reason: Tree is dead.\rT3 Leylandii (x1) - Cut back side over garden by 1.5-2m. Final width to be 4m. \rT6 Magnolia (x1) - Cut back overhanging branches by 1.5m. Final width to be 5m.",
