  "description": "Oak - reduce overhanging growth a close to boundary as possible whilst retaining suitable furnishing growth - approx 2/3m\rTree canopy extends 6 m up the garden of 31 Woodlands Road from the edge of the boundary \rwall and 7m from the centre of the tree, which is just behind the boundary wall. From the ground to the top of the fence is 2.4m and the tree is approx 5 times this height , so 12m high. Proposal is to reduce height by 3m and width by 3m on our side to even out the tree",
