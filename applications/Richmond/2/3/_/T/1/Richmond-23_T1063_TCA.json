  "description": "Tree no. T5 as per the attached Arboricultural Report by ACS Trees dated 13th May 2022, Eucalyptus gunnii (Cider Gum, Category C), in the rear garden of no.34 St Mary's Grove.\rAlso see 'Tree 5' on attached drawing no. SMGG21-02B SITE LAYOUT and ROOF PLAN\rThe proposed works are to remove the tree and plant a new, native replacement tree.\r\rSince commencement of planning ref: 23/1342/VRC, it has come to our attention that the tree has roots located where the foundations will be going for the end corner of Plot 5. To try and span over them with a beam and pad foundation will mean putting foundations in the privately owned neighbour's garden, which is not acceptable. We have been advised by our arboriculturist that the existing tree is:\r\r- a non-native, fast growing species, largely out of character with local area.\r- a high-water demand species, with potential to cause future damage to the new building.\r\rThe Planning Officer for planning ref: 23/1342/VRC has been contacted prior to this application who stated that on site replacement tree planting should be explored. The owners of no.34 St Mary's Grove have been in discussion with the applicant and have agreed to the existing tree being removed and a replacement planted.",
