  "description": "Remove a large Cordyline Australis palm tree that is in the south east corner of our front garden.  The tree has grown very large (approximately 5m tall and 3m across) and is very close to the house (110cm) and the pavement (20cm).  The tree sheds a lot of leaves onto the surrounding pavements and streets and these are not swept up by the street cleaners due to their awkward shape. The leaves end up scattered around the roads making the area messy and contributing to the blockage of local drains. Being an exotic palm it is out of keeping with the traditional architecture of the house and the surrounding townscape, as well as the more traditional trees on Kew Green and around Kew Pond.  We are landscaping our front garden to replace the extensive concrete paving with mixed shrubs and would like to remove this palm as part of these works.",
