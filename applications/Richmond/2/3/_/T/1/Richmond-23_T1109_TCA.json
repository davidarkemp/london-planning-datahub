  "description": "We propose to remove the Copper Beach Tree at the back of our garden and ground out the stump to ground level and replace with evergreen trees in a similar location. \r\rThe tree blocks a considerable amount of light for neighbouring properties, especially those of our neighbours on Onslow Road. It has  caused damage to the boundary wall at the rear and as it is so close to it. It is of low amenity value for us and our neighbours and we would like to replace with trees of more suitable size and scale for the gardens it affects to improve amenity for all.",
