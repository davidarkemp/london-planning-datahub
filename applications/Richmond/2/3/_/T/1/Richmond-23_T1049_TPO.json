  "description": "The removal of the two sycamore trees located at the rear of a small garden is necessitated by several critical factors:\rSize Disproportion: The trees have outgrown their space, becoming disproportionately large for the small scale of the garden. This overgrowth disrupts the balance and aesthetics of the landscape.\r\rAdverse Impact on Neighboring Gardens: Their significant size and dense foliage result in excessive overshadowing of neighboring smaller gardens, adversely affecting the growth and health of plants in these adjacent areas.\r\rLong-Term Ownership and Management: The trees have been under our ownership for many years, during which we have observed their growth and its impacts. This long-term observation supports our conclusion that their removal is necessary.\r\rMitigation by Surrounding Vegetation: The amenity value offered by these sycamore trees is considerably mitigated by the presence of surrounding trees and shrubs. These other plants, which are currently suppressed by the sycamores, will thrive and contribute to the gardens ecology once the sycamores are removed.\r\rExcessive Shading and Root Damage: The dense canopy of the sycamore trees casts heavy shade, detrimentally affecting the health and growth of underplantings. Furthermore, their extensive root systems pose a potential risk to the garden's landscape, including structures and other plantings.\r\rLow Amenity Value: Given their location and the negative impacts they have on the garden and its surroundings, the amenity value of these sycamore trees is relatively low.\r\rRetention of Alternative Specimen Tree: We plan to retain another specimen tree in the area, which provides adequate screening from the pathway and contributes positively to the garden's overall character and privacy.\r\rUnsuitability of Pruning: Reducing these trees is not a viable option. Pruning to a significant extent would result in poorly formed trees and necessitate a high maintenance cycle, which is not sustainable in the lo...",
