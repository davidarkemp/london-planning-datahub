  "description": "Previous planning approved under 23/T0534/TPO. When the reductions took place it was established that further work was required due to the condition of the T1. A survey was carried out and the advice is to remove T1 and reduce T2. \r\rT1 - Lombardy Poplar - remove to ground level. As per tree survey there is internal decay and residual wall is not sufficient enough to allow retention of the tree. The advice is to remove to ground level and propose to replace with Dawyks Beech (Fagus Sylvatica 'Dawyck').\r\rT2 - Lombardy Poplar - Canopy reduction of 5m. Tree Survey confirms the internal structure of the tree is satisfactory however a 5m reduction to the canopy has been recommended as this tree will be exposed once T1 is felled. Current height is 15m.",
