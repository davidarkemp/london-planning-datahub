  "description": "T1 = Bay tree along border with 23D Onslow Road. We are requesting permission to reduce the crown by ~30%. At a guess the tree is currently 5.5m in height, with a crown that is 4m in height by 3m in width. The proposed pruning would reduce the crown to a height of 2.5m and 2.5m width; this would reduce the total height of the tree to 4m. The tree causes excessive shading: Almost half of the crown overhangs the garden of 23D Onslow Road, it almost completely blocks 25B's kitchen window and significantly reduces light into our bathroom. Both our neighbours would be delighted if it was cut back. \r\rT2 = Unknown species along border with 27 Onslow Road. We are requesting permission to reduce the crown by ~30%.At a guess the tree in question is currently 7m in height, with a crown that is 5m in height by 4m in width. The proposed pruning would reduce the crown to a height of 3m and 3m width; this would reduce the total height of the tree to 5m. This tree also causes excessive shading: Almost half of the crown overhangs the garden of 27 Onslow Road, it almost completely blocks 25B's bedroom window and significantly reduces light into our bedroom. Both neighbours would be delighted if it was cut back.",
