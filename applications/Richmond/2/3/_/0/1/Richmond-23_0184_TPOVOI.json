  "description": "The Tree is subject to TO915. It is a London Lime which had previously been regularly pollarded before the pollard was allowed to grow out. As a consequence, there is a profusion of whippy growths emanating from the pollard stumps. These need to be selectively trimmed back to the stronger few to preserve the ability of the growth from the stumps to withstand high winds, reduce the competition for space and ensure healthy growth of the remaining strong branches. There is a danger that when the tree is in full leaf that such thin long branches will be torn from the stumps and rip down the trunks hence damaging the tree. The current tree is the remaining survivor of a double stemmed tree. The other stem is diseased, reduced to less than a metre high and slowing rotting through. In order to protect the remaining tree it is important not to subject it to any unnecessary stress. This work is as per the careplan for the tree agreed with LBRuT. It is the only tree on the property with a TO and is T1 on the sketch plan. The tree is sited over 10 metres from any property however overhangs gardens where small children play. Therefore falling branches would be a safety risk.",
