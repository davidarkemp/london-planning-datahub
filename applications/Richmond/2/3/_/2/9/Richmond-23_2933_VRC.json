The proposed changes include slight relocation of doors/windows due to internal layout changes (including wider front door with a sidelight, new side window, removal of roof rooflight, addition of an extra 'step' to the kitchen window, installation of two smaller rooflights in the rear extension instead of the bigger one approved), addition of a storage for bins and cycles at the front, removal of the built-in planters (in front and rear), exposed brickwork to have standard stretcher bond instead of horizontal and vertical stack. More details in the 'Planning Statement' and the proposed drawings.",
