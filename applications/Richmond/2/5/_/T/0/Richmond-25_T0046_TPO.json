  "description": "T1 Quercus palustris (Pin Oak): Fell to Ground Level\rThis submission outlines the technical evidence supporting the tree's removal, demonstrates the inadequacy of alternative management strategies, and proposes a replacement plan to sustain environmental and aesthetic contributions.\r\rTechnical Evidence Supporting Removal\rStructural Defects and Risk of Failure\rSignificant Crack and Decay: The Pin Oak has a large crack from the base to 2 meters, with internal decay probed to a depth of 6 inches, indicating severe structural degradation. This creates a high risk of stem failure, especially during adverse weather.\r\rHigh-Risk Target Area: Proximity to the property at 72 Stanley Road poses a hazard to occupants and the building. Surrounding structures further amplify the risks posed by the tree's instability.\r\rUnsuitability of Location\r\rThough not yet mature, the tree's location close to the house and other structures makes it unsuitable. As it grows, its root system and canopy will increase risks to properties. Its placement behind the house also offers low public amenity value.\r\rPhysiological Decline\r\rLack of Foliage: Documented low foliage and bud burst over multiple seasons indicate severe stress and irreversible decline.\r\rLimitations of Remedial Options\r\rCrown Reduction Ineffectiveness: Crown reduction cannot resolve structural issues caused by internal decay. Extensive pruning would likely accelerate decline by increasing vulnerability to further decay and infection.\r\rRisk Management Limitations: Advanced decay and proximity to the property make retaining the tree unacceptably risky, even with monitoring or mitigation.\r\rOccupiers' Liability\r\rThe tree's defects create significant legal liability under the Occupiers' Liability Acts of 1957 & 1984. Retaining a dangerous tree in a high-risk area exposes the landowner to liability if it fails.\r\rAlignment with TPO Exemptions\r\rUnder the Town and Country Planning Act, exemptions to TPO ...",
