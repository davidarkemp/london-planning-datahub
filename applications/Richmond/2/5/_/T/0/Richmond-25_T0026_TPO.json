  "description": "Justification for Removal\rAmenity Impact\rLimited Amenity Loss: The removal of T1 will result in minimal loss of amenity value due to the retention of adjacent trees that provide sufficient canopy cover and visual interest. These adjacent trees will continue to serve the ecological and aesthetic needs of the site and surrounding area.\rTree Competition and Space Constraints\rProximity to Adjacent Tree: T1 is in close proximity to another tree, which will result in mutual suppression as they mature. Given their immature growth stages, the competition for light, space, and nutrients will only intensify, leading to compromised health and form for both trees. The removal of T1 will provide the adjacent tree with adequate room to thrive and reach its full potential.\r\rStructural and Rooting Issues\rRoot-Related Damage: The roots of T1 are causing direct damage to the pavement and fence. The roots are visibly girdled over the pavement, causing trip hazards and structural instability.\rProximity to Wall: The trees close proximity to a nearby wall indicates a high likelihood of future structural damage as the roots continue to expand. This will result in significant costs for repairs and ongoing maintenance, which could be avoided by removing the tree at this stage.\r\rUnsuitability for Location\rInadequate Garden Space: T1s location within a confined garden is unsuitable for its size and growth habit at maturity. As the tree grows, its canopy and root system will dominate the limited space, impacting the usability of the garden.\rLight Obstruction: The tree currently blocks light to the property and surrounding area. As it matures, this issue will worsen, impacting the quality of life for occupants and potentially reducing property value.\r\rSafe Useful Life Expectancy\rReduced Lifespan in Current Location: The tree's location and associated pressures from hardscaping and adjacent structures severely limit its Safe Useful Life Expectancy. Its removal is necessary to prevent ...",
