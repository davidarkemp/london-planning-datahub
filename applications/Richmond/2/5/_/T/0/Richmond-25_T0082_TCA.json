There is Ganoderma Australe Fungus at base of tree. \rClient would like to retain the tree but reduce past previous pruning points for safety as it is very close to property and spans over 3 gardens. \rThe previous pruning points are at approx. 12 meters. We propose to reduce in height to 9 meters and reduce lateral branches by 2 meters holistically leaving a 6 meter span.",
