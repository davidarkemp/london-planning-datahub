  "description": "Removal of 2 laurel trees on the rear boundary (marked T1 and T2). These trees are too large for the small rear garden and make the rear most section of garden adjacent to the shed unusable. No replacement tree is proposed, as this garden already has two Prunus Lusitanica Augustifolia (T6 and T7), one Feijoa sellowiana (T5), one Laurus nobilis (T4) and one Clerodendrum trichotomum (T3). There will however be some planting introduced on the rear boundary in place of the trees.",
