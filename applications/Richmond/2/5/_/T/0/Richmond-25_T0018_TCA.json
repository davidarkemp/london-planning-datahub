  "description": "T1 Is a Eucalyptus tree  of approx. 1.4m girth (measured 1m above ground) which is adjacent to the rear boundary of 13 Mortlake road and overhangs the rear boundary into neighbouring  garden. T1 Has been previously pollarded some years ago and the proposal is to reinstate to pollard removing the loosely attached new growth from the knuckles. As some of this growth is falling and the owner is getting complaints from the neighbour. The tree is currently approx. 10m high and will be reduced to approx. 7m high 8m wide reduced to approx. 6m wide crown.",
