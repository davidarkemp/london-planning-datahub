  "description": "16m Hornbeam in front garden.- Reduction in length of 3 branches (approximately 6m in length) that overhang the roof of the property. The roof was partially stolen and requires full replacement (new copper roof to be installed per Planning App: 21/1864/FUL (granted 31/03/2022), and as such, scaffolding and a protective tin roof are required. These need 1.5m of clear space around the building to allow the contractors to work safely.\rPermission is sought to reduce 3 branches to give the requisite safe space to erect scaffold and conduct works. This would involve trimming branches by the minimum possible to allow this (up to a maximum of approx 3m per branch, less if possible)\r\rThe Hornbeam has a provisional TPO (raised 19/10/2023), which we are very mindful of respecting. We want to do the minimum possible to the tree to allow for the scaffolding and works to happen safely.\r\rWhile trimming, we would ask tree surgeon to remove any dead wood present from the tree as routine maintenance.\r\rElsewhere, the height and width of the tree will not change.",
