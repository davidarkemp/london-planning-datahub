  "description": "Our property, 34 Glamorgan Road, backs on to the Wilderness. Over the 27 years we've lived here the trees in the Wilderness have got bigger and bigger and have had no attention. There are several sycamore trees which  now significantly overhang our garden (and those of our neighbours) to the point where they obscure the light, drop a lot of leaves, cause damage to the garden sheds in both gardens, and are potentially a hazard in high winds. We are therefore seeking permission to prune the branches overhanging numbers 34 and 36 Glamorgan Road.",
