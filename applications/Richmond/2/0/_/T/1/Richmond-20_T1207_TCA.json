  "description": "Location: Section of land to front of property \r1. Corsican Pine An inspection revealed a 15% lean towards property. Although there has been no evidence of movement around the base/root plate area over the last few years, and further to my discussion with Mr Green, no increased lean, I would still recommend lessening weight-loading on the south western flank of the upper crown to lessen weight and increase stability. \r\rRequested Works: Reduce selected branches in upper south-western section of crown by up to 3m ensuring reduction to suitable growth points. These works will not change the general shape of the tree (existing height 16/18 m)\rReason: to reduce weight-loading to root area due to adverse lean towards property",
