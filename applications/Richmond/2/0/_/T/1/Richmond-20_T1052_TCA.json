  "description": "T1 - Lebanon Cedar:\rVisual Tree Inspection Findings (VTA):\rThe tree has an over extended radial canopy which protrudes east over a very busy road (A307), is extremely end weighted and is a Cedar tree which is prone to limb shedding, hence the requirement for intervention. \rIn addition to the biomechanical defects noted, the tree is being falsely strengthened by historic cable bracing which is likely to have become weakened due to its age and condition. The supported limb(s) may have become reliant on the bracing and could therefore be far less safe. This is particularly concerning as if the bracing fails (snaps because it has rusted and degraded), then the large lateral spread overhanging the road which is being supported by it may also fail. \r\rRecommended Intervention:\rDue to the significant volume of weight extending above the road, it would be prudent to significantly reduce the overextended radial spread of the tree. Selective end weight pruning and removal of deadwood, along with lateral limb reduction of at least 3 metres is recommended and will mitigate the likelihood of failure without detriment to the vigour or aesthetical value of the tree. \rThe work will best be undertaken from a MEWP (mobile elevated work platform.\r20/T1052/TCA:\r\rThe current eastern radial spread is currently approximately 11 metres and will be no less than 8 metres after pruning.\r\r",
