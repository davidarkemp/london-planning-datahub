  "description": "T1 - Oak significantly reduce the overextended radial spread of the lateral canopy. Selective end weigh pruning along with lateral limb reduction of 3 metres is recommended and will mitigate the likelihood of failure without detriment to the vigour or aesthetical value of the tree. Pruning wounds will not exceed 100mm.\rT2 -Oak -  Due to the significant volume of weight extending above the potential failure point it would be prudent to significantly reduced the overextended radial spread of the defective limb. Selective end weight pruning along with lateral limb reduction of 2.5 metres is recommended and will mitigate the likelihood of failure without detriment to the vigour or aesthetical value of the tree.\rPruning wounds will not exceed 100mm.\rT1 Oak: \rThe current radial spread is approximately 11 metres and will be no less than 8 metres after pruning.\r\rT2 Oak:\rThe current radial spread is approximately 10 metres and will be no less than 7.5 metres after pruning.\r",
