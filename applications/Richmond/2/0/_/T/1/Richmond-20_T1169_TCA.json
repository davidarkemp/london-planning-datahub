  "description": "We need to regularly prune our oak tree as it very close to our house and the flats in Acorn Court, 275 Hanworth Road. It has been a few years since this was last done, and we need to do it again in the near future. As ever we will have a tree surgeon carry out the work. We will prune back by no more than 25%.\rThe height of the tree is approximately 14m, and the canopy spread is currently 11m. Reducing the canopy by 25% will result in a reduction of 1.375 metres all round, or where it is needed, leaving a canopy spread of 8.25m, and a minimum height of 12.625.",
