  "description": "Our recently purchased property has a garden that has been left un-landscaped for decades and we wish to clear the debris and self seeded and dead plants so we can do landscaping. \rT1 - this is a dead Acer. We would like to remove this tree for safety reasons. Once we have cleared the garden of debris we will replant a similar sized tree at the end of the garden once our garden design is chosen.\rT2 - this is a self-seeded Acer tree. We would like to remove this to allow for landscaping and will replant a similar sized tree at the end of the garden once our garden design is chosen.\rT3 - this Holly tree is overhanging and we wish to prune it back to the property line.\r\rThere is a TPO on an Acer tree at the back of the garden. We don't wish to do any work on this tree at the moment.",
