  "description": "Rear Garden:\rRobinia 25% Reduction, pruning branches back by 1.5 - 2 m. Leaving even balanced canopy.\rThe Tree at present is 20m tall and 10 wide. My client would like the regrowth pruned back to the old points, leaving 75cm - 1m lengths of growth from the old points ( the tick bits ) Therefore pruning back the regrowth by 1.5 - 2m. So the overal height of the tree will be 18m and the width 8m.",
