  "description": "T1 - mature Robinia tree growing beside greenhouse on rear boundary of garden.  Tree has a height of approx 18m and spread of approx 11m, the tree has a low limb that extends over the lawn and area used for growing vegetables.  Proposed works are to remove this limb back to main stem to allow light into area beneath, these works will not affect overall height and spread of tree.\rT2 - mature Robinia tree growing beside greenhouse on right-hand boundary beside Barge Walk.  Tree has a height of approx 18m and spread of approx 10m.  Proposed works are to reduce lower section of crown overhanging greenhouse by approx 1.5-2m to reduce endweight and give clearance from greenhouse.  These works will not affect the height of the tree and will reduce spread of lower crown to approx 8m.",
