There is an old wound at the base of this limb from an historical limb failure, which had visible fungal fruiting bodies emanating from it at the time of inspection, indicating ingress of decay at the old wound site. Therefore it would be prudent to significantly reduce this limb to reduce the risk of future failure.",
