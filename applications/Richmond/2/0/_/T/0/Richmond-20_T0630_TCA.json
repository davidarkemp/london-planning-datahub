  "description": "T1 is a mature specimen sycamore it  has a 2.5M girth and is approx. 22 meters high. It is situated only 2 Meters from the garage wall of close house. T1 is in serious decline with approaching 1/3rd of the crown now not leafing out and starting to decay. I would suggest that the tree has been in decline for some time and it is only now with the extensive die back that the problem has become apparent. The tree is in an unusual location on a slightly raised mound between the house and the fenced boundary  (I will attach photo). I don't know the history of the tree so can only speculate as to why it is in this location.\rThe crown extends across the roof of the property on one side and the public road on the other and because of the now extensive decay will at some point in the near future substantial limbs fall onto the roof of close house. As the tree is in terminal decline there would be little point in undertaking remedial works and due to the proximity of high value targets my proposal is to Fell in sections and grind out the stump.  These works will need to be carried out immediately as the tree is in imminent danger of collapse or partial collapse.\rAll tree works to be carried out in accordance with B.S.3998",
