  "description": "The trees in question are in the garden of our neighbours at 49 Lower Teddington Road.\rThe trees over-hang our garden in 32 Seymour Road and are to be reduced in size or removed by our neighbour.\rA tall fir tree, covered in ivy, has a large branch hanging at a horizontal angle over our side passage / garden patio area.  The tree is roughly 12 metres in height and is to be reduced in size by approximately 35%.\rSome young self-planted sycamore trees are growing rapidly against our boundary wall and are to be removed to avoid future damage.\rNone of the trees is subject to a TPO.  However both our house and our neighbour's house are in the Hampton Wick Conservation Area.",
