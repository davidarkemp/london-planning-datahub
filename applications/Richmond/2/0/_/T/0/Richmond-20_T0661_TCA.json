  "description": "T1 - Fir tree - Fell to ground level. We would like to remove this tree and replace it with another tree along the same side of the garden (see site plan 1). A better specimen tree would be preferred which would add tree cover and have more wildlife value. \rT2 - Mature turkey oak -  in front garden. We would like to carry out a crown reduction back to previous cutting points. This would mean approx 3 to 4 m of branches to be removed. Also to remove lower branch leaning over driveway with disease (see photo). Take back to main trunk. Also remove other lower branch leaning out towards pavement to keep a good even shape to the tree. The remaining tree size after the crown reduction would be approximately 6m wide x 9m high",
