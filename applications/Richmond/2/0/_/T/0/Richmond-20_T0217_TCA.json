  "description": "London Plane (T1)- To reduce the entire crown of the large London Plane tree closest to the house (T1) by up to 4 metres, back to previous pruning points. Tree is approximately 25m tall. Leave height at 21m. Width varies due to previous pruning but approximately 24m, leave at 20ms. Reduce the height to reduce excessive shading when in leaf. Branches are hitting the roof & buildings during winds.\r\rLondon Plane (T2, 3 & 4)-Reduce the height to reduce excessive shading when in leaf. Bring down to the height of other trees along the row to encourage uniformity.  To reduce the height of 3x large London plane trees down by 4 metres, to the same height as T1. Trees are approximately 25m tall. Leave heights at 21m. Width varies due to previous pruning but approximately 24m, leave at 20ms.\r\rSycamore (T5)- Crown thin by 20%. Tree is becoming too dense and creating excessive shading over both garden and building it is growing adjacent to.",
