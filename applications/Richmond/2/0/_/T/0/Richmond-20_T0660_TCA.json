  "description": "Replacement of Tree of Heaven with a non-invasive species.  The tree has grown too large for the location and after >3 reductions is growing more vigorously than ever.  It is of low amenity and is overshadowing a much more attractive cherry plumb tree growing on the edge of the road (outside our boundary).  It is the probable source of repeated, self seeding Tree of Heaven saplings along the verge.  To be replaced with a species which is both more suitable for the location and removes the ongoing self propagation of a troublesome species - probably a cherry tree.",
