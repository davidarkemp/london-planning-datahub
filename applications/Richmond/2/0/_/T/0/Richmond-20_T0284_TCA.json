Reduce height to 4.5m & spread to 3.5m) The client has requested to fell the bay tree instead of a reduction. This is to allow more light into the property as it is currently restrictive for both neighbours. \rT2 - Eucalyptus tree - Reduce height by 2.5 - 3 metres, reduce sides by 2 metres to balance canopy and maintain an even shape, lift lower branches by 2 metres from ground level to allow more light, remove ivy from tree down to fence height., Height 11m & spread 8m. Reduce height to 8.5m & spread to 5m) Reduce to give 2m clearance\rT4 - Apple tree - Remove x2 centre trees to allow space for remaining trees, dig out x2 stumps",
