  "description": "Please can this be considered as a 5 day exemption notice: Dead, dying or dangerous tree\rT1 - Ash (rear boundary of property)\rFell to as low as practically possible (approx 1.5m in height)  Reason:\rEvidence from climber after previous works were carried out:\rOn Friday 5th June we attended the site of No.59 to re-pollard this tree.\rWhen I climbed the tree, I noticed it was in extremely bad shape. There were some severe cavities at the point of crown break and only a small amount of live holding wood. The upper section of the tree is covered in fungal fruiting bodies that indicate signs of structural weakness. (King Alfreds balls we think)\rGiven the trees state and location, I would strongly advise having it removed as it poses quite a significant risk to the neighbouring property and garages in the rear garden.\rPlease note there is anytime access to assess this tree.",
