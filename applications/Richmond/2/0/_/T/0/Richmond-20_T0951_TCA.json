  "description": "T1 - llarge multi stemmed Magnolia which is located in the garden of No. 29  but who's crown straddles the boundary between 29 and 31A.  The garden of 29 is at a higher level than that of 31. Some of the branches are now touching the rear elevation of 31A and the proposal would be to remove targeted branches to keep the crown from touching the rear elevation  this will involve removing 1 branch back to a trunk and then trimming approx. .5 meters form the smaller growth back to pervious cut points.  A second branch which currently extends into the garden causing excessive shading cut back to the boundary wall .  There are also some small growths which grow down into the garden of 31A so we would remove these this would effectively be raising the crown to level with the top of the boundary wall  2.4M on 31A side",
