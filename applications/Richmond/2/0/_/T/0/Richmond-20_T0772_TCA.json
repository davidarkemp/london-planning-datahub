  "description": "Front Garden Left hand side of entrance\rT1 - Silver Birch x 1 (Betula pendula / alba) This tree has been reduced so many times in the past. In discussions with the client we feel it prudent to fell the tree to a height of 1.5 m. Leaving the remaining section for the bugs, beetles and the \rFront Garden Right hand side of entrance\rT2 - Hawthorn x 1 (Crataegus monogyna) Re-Reduce all around by 1m.\rRear garden Right hand side.\rT3 - Silver Birch x 1 (Betula pendula / alba) Reduce by 1.5m all around. Remove all deadwood throughout the crown. Clean out the crown be sure to remove any dead stubs and broken branches.\rRear garden left hand side\rT4 - Silver Birch x 1 (Betula pendula / alba) This tree is 90% Ivy clad. This has prevented light reaching the branch extremities, therefore the condition of the crown cannot be determined from ground level. I recommend we remove the Ivy from within the crown, we remove all deadwood, asses the crown then reduce lateral branches to shape.",
