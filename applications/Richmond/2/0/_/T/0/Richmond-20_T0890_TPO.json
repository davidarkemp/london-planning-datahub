  "description": "Please refer to application 20/T0202/TPO made by my tree surgeon that was refused on 03/04/20. Please see that application for another sketch plan and brief details. That application was to thin the trees by 15%. As that was refused, on the basis of insufficient details, I would request that someone from the Council's tree department advises what work is permitted that will solve the problems I set out in more detail below:\rThe trees overhang garages at my property, Ingram House garages and my next-door- neighbour's garden where she is about to build an office/gym.  They are therefore in a heavily used urban area where people regularly come and go/will be spending large amounts of time. Sizeable branches have come off the trees in the last 2 years (October 2018 and February 2020) causing damage to my garage on the first occasion and nuisance to Ingram House on the second when a branch fell on their garages and it was only by chance that the branch landed horizontally - had it been vertically it would have pierced the garage roofs and damaged anything/anyone inside. As a result of one of these falls there is now a large wound at the top of one of the trees and I am concerned that this has weakened that tree and made it less stable. The branches of both trees are heavy and I am concerned that any further branch falling might cause death, injury and/or damage to the property directly underneath including garages, cars or my neighbour's new build. With the storm season approaching, this could happen soon. The garage area floods regularly, including last weekend, as the soakaway gets blocked with pine needles and other debris from the trees. When this happens I have to pump flood water onto land near the trees which might be contributing to their growth and therefore the above issues. \rThe trees are beautiful and I do not want to lose either of them completely which I fear may be the case if the issues with the wound in one are not addressed. I would welcome guidance ...",
