  "description": "Chestnut (T1) - This tree is on our boundary with 32 Montague Road; the vast majority of the tree is in 32 Montague, i.e. they are the owners. The tree has undergone some pruning by the Montague Road owners; once in 2010 for which permission was granted and again in ~2017 for which it seems permission was not requested. The majority of the crown reduction and thinning has been undertaken on the Montague Road side of the tree. We would like to do something similar with the branches that overhang our garden and that of 27 Onslow Road (the owners of which are in agreement that we could all do with some more light in our homes and gardens) - because of excessive shading. We are proposing to remove 1 branch that overhangs our garden and trim a few others (thinning) under the guidance of the tree surgeon selected to perform the works. \r\rBay (T2) - This is a common shrub that should have been pruned regularly over the years and now dominates our small garden causing excessive shading. Almost half of the crown overhangs the garden of 23D Onslow Road and it almost completely blocks 25B's kitchen window. Both neighbours would be delighted if we removed it or reduced it considerably. We are proposing to reduce the crown by the maximum allowed (30%).\r\rUnknown species (T3) - This tree is located on our boundary with 27 Onslow Road (we are the owners) and our neighbours are happy for it to be pruned to allow more light into their garden. We are proposing to reduce the crown by ~25% with some thinning to address excessive shading.",
