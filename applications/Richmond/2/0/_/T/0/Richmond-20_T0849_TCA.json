  "description": "T1 - Cupressocyparis leylandii.  Approx 10m x 5m.  Reduce overall crown by no more than 30% to maintain a balanced shape;  reduce overhang into neighbour's garden; remove dead branches.\rT 2 - T14 - Cupressocyparis leylandii.  13 trees in total planted in a row along 10m x approx 8m in height x 3m in depth .  Reduce overall crown by no more than 30%, remove dead branches to improve amenity and control growth.\rThese 14 trees ( T1 - T14) are all planted close against the boundary fences.  They all have a poor shape, together create excessive shading to the owner's garden and those of their neighbours and are currently growing over into the neighbours' properties on two of the shared boundaries.  Crown reduction and sensitive pruning by a qualified arboriculturalist will improve amenity and their aesthetic value.",
