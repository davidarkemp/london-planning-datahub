The tree's height is 11m and crown spread is 9m - After the works, the tree's height is 11m and the crown spread is 9m.\rT2 Sycamore - Decay in main stems that may cause structural instability and subsequent failure - Pollard at 4m to allow new crown development.  \rThe tree's height is 14m and crown spread is 7m - After the works, the tree's height is 4m and the crown spread is 2m.\rT3 Sycamore Section fell:  Sooty bark disease is present in main stems.\rSection fell to near ground level. The tree's height is 14m and crown spread is 7m - After the works, the tree's height is 0.0m and the crown spread is 0.0m.\rT5 False Acacia - Reduce back selected branches to provide 2m clearance from elevation of adjacent property.\rPoor main fork/junction -Supply & install a 4 tonne Cobra flexible brace system between two main stems at approx. 16m to pre-empt possible main fork failure. Prune out Mistletoe and dead branches.The tree's  height is 17m and crown spread is 11m - After the works, the tree's height is 17m and the crown spread is 11m.\rT6 False Acacia Reduction due to significant dead branches in upper crown. Reducing the height by 2.5m and lateral spread by up to 2m to a rounded natural form. Reduce dying stem over main road to suitable live and sound wood.
