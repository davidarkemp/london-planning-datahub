  "description": "Large Yew Tree (Taxus Bacatta) on right (East) side of rear garden - overlooking Vigo House and also Dolphin House next door.  Marked #1 on attached sketch. \rThis tree has grown too large in its current form for its the garden and needs to be pruned to reduce overcrowding and to allow more light - We are proposing using a professional arborist (tree surgeon) to reduce the crown by 25% (2 metres), remove excess growth by pruning the sides and reshape the tree to better suit the location.  \rAdditional detailed specification details: \rTree is currently 8 metres tall and has a spread of 6 metres. \rThe tree will have a 2 metres reduction on the height and will be pruned by 1.5 metres on the sides. The overall height after pruning will be 6m and the spread after pruning will be 4.5 metres",
