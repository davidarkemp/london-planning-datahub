  "description": "Barge Walk - To fell x3 semi mature Fraxinus excelsior trees on Barge walk, near Kingston Bridge. These trees are interfering with boat mooring areas and are starting to show ash dieback symptoms. 3 Prunus spp. will be planted as a replacement further south on Barge Walk. Tree tag numbers B0803, B0806, B0809\r\rThe Wilderness - To fell x2 Lawson Cypress and 1 Serbian spruce. One Lawson cypress is very close to a third party property and is declining health. The second Lawson cypress and Serbian spruce are subdominant to a Sequiadendron sempervirens specimen, that we would like to create room around. Some smaller shrub species, that can be easily maintained will be put in place of the Lawson and  Serbian spruce. Tree tag numbers G0387, G0429, G0396\r\rThe Wilderness - To fell 1 mature Fagus sylvatica with Meripulus fungal fruiting bodies at the base. This tree is located adjacent to the Hampton Court Maze, a popular attraction for many school trips and families so there is significant risk associated with this stem. This tree will be replacement planted with a similar specimen to fill the large space that will be created, either Castanea sativa or Carpinus betulus. Tree Tag G0248.\r\rTo fell 1 large dead Cedrus spp. on the east front within Hampton Court Palace Gardens. Replacement planting will take place to maintain a dappled screen to the palace. Tag number G0756.",
