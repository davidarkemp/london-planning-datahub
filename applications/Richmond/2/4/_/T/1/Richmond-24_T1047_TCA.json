The tree is a poor condition with multiple large cavities, it is located adjacent to a historic wall, although there is not much weight, the high levels of visible decay create concern that any failure will damage the listed wall. A bat survey is planned before any cutting takes places. Tree code: 28552  \r\rTo fell a group of 3 semi mature sycamore and 1 horse chestnut that are extremely close to listed walls which require protection from tree roots to mitigate against foreseeable damage. Also 1 horse chestnut to reduce by 3m, from a 15m diameter crown spread to a 12m diameter, to avoid large limbs failing onto listed wall. Tree codes: 28504, 28512, 28516, 28524, 28532.",
