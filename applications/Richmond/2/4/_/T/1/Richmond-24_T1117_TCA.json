  "description": "Back Garden (Left Boundary) \r\rT1: Yew tree - Lift canopy to 1 - 1.5m above fence, reduce height by 2 - 2.5m through selective thinning  leaving a Holistic crown reduction , reduce sides by 1 - 1.5m through selective thinning  leaving a Holistic crown reduction, thin canopy by 5% \r\rheight 8m & spread 6m. Reduce height to 6m & spread to 5m\r\rThe reason for the work is to reduce the size of a tree located in the back left hand side of the garden. The tree has grown very large for the area it is in, and the client wants to keep it but reduce its size. \r\rThis is also necessary because the tree is located in close proximity to two garden boundary walls, and the trunk growth and roots could potentially damage these structures. \r\rIt is causing excessive shading to surrounding shrubs. By reducing its size, we will be able to allow more light into the surrounding gardens and promote the growth of the other plants. This will also create a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing area in line with the neighbouring gardens.",
