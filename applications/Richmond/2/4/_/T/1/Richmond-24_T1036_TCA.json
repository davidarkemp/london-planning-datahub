  "description": "'T2 Birch B2', designated as a Category B tree, is requiring works to reduce the crown by roughly 6m in height to where it was last reduced to (planning application 05/T0198/TCA). The previous works can clearly be seen in the photograph attached. The recent growth is causing leaves to fall into guttering on both adjacent properties and frequently results in sticks and twigs to fall into the gardens, particularly after bad weather. It is intended for the crown to be reduced primarily in height, and in width only to maintain the same crown shape. No other works are intended on the tree or any other tree - 2m crown reduction in width and 4m reduction in height,\rleaving a canopy spread of 4m and height of 9m\r",
