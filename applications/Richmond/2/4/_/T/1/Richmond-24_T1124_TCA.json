  "description": "The work we would like to carry out is pollarding a Willow tree. Please see IMG_01. We requested a meeting with your tree officer Jacob yesterday to get advice on what would be best to facilitate our upcoming construction project. We (Port Hampton Estates Limited) thought removal of the tree would be best but Jacob suggested keeping the tree and pollarding to allow the sheet piling. Please see IMG_06: the blue line represents the position  where the sheet pile needs to be installed, the red line represents the vertical line of where the 12m sheet pile will need to be positioned for it to be driven into the river bed whilst remaining plumb / vertical at all times. We plan to get a tree surgeon to climb, cut back where necessary and remove waste. \r\rThe work to be undertaken is essential work to stop the erosion of the property which happens when the river is fast flowing. Being an island in the middle of the river the erosion is excessive to a point where we it has been confirmed that island has historically eroded nearly 5m. Please see IMG_03 and IMG_04 where the fast flowing water has severely undermined the willow tree in question. This work will protect the health of tree in question for the long term future. \r\rIMG_05 - Shows decaying limb that needs removing \r\rPlease see location of the tree on the sketch plan. I have attached red and white tikka tape to the tree to highlight the tree for inspection. \r\rBat survey to follow as requested by Jacob\r\rAppreciate these decisions can take time, however, we would really appreciate if this particular application could be hurried along please. We had an onsite meeting with the contractor who only just noticed that the work cannot be completed with the tree how it currently is. The work is scheduled to start around the middle of February. This is the reason that we requested a meeting with Jacob to ensure we put in the correct work application to try and minimise the risk of it being rejected.",
