  "description": "The tree is a London Plane - Tag Number G0034. 21 meters in height with a crown spread of 19 meters. Two significant lateral limbs failed during storm Darragh, the larger limb failed due to a small amount of included bark not visible from the ground, the weight of the branch then subsequently took out a the lower branch. There are two tears within the crown but with a significant amount (over 50%) of sound holding wood. Due to the crown now becoming more exposed we plan on completing a reduction of 5m over the whole crown, the tree will then be 16m tall with a spread of 14m. This is so that the overall character of the tree is not lost and a significant amount of sail will be reduced, therefore reducing the risk to potential future storm damage. We would intend to complete a crown reduction to maintain the tree size every 5 years.",
