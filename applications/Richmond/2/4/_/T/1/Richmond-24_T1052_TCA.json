  "description": "One very tall oak tree, in front garden. Requires pruning to tidy it up and prevent it encroaching on the surrounding buildings. Proposed work is to remove all ivy and lower epicormic growth up to main crown break, to reduce crown by 20% and thin by 20%, removing all dead wood and unsightly pegs. The arborist says that the work should be done in the winter before the tree buds, due to the presence of processionary moth (the eggs hatch as the tree starts to bud).tree is approximately 12m high, with a crown of about 5m in height. The width is approximately 7m in diameter. We propose a 1.5m reduction in height to the crown leaving a crown height of approximately 3.5m; and a 2m reduction in width, leaving a canopy spread of 5m.",
