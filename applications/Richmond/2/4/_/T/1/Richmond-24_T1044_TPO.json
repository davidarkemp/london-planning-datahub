  "description": "T18 - Oak Tree - crown reduce from 25m high and 22m wide to 21m high and 19m wide due to the tree being too large for the area and shading the fairway. Thai will give the grass beneath it a better chance of growing. Tree is interfering with golf play.\rG7 - Pine Trees - crown lift from 20m high and 10m wide. Height and width will remain the same but bottom limbs will be lost, up to 5m.\rReason for doing this is to create more space for light and for the turf. Branches are getting in the way of machinery.",
