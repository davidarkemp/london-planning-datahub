  "description": "T2- Tree of heaven,  fell to ground level. Tree consists of two main stems. The Western stem splits into 3 at 1.5m. Western stem has significant bark damage from nearly ground level up to 1.5m. Tight union between the stems at ground level. Bark damage originates around a previously removed stem. Stems have been structurally compromised. Fungal pseudoslerptial plates visible on the exposed structural wood. Crusty black deposits similar to Kretzschmaria deusta present on the stem. Ivy growing up the Eastern stem into the upper crown. History of past pruning. Risk of whole stem / tree failure\r\rT1 - tulip tree, crown reduce the height and radial spread by up to 3m back to suitable growth points, Single stem with crown break at 9m. Several old pruning wounds on the main stem. Some are very recent with no reactive growth. Others are partially and fully occluded. Swelling at the base of the stem on the North East Side at 1m which appears to be a bur growth. Tree hashistorically been crown reduced and is showing approx. 5-6 of regrowth from the reduction points. Large tear out wound on North side at 10-12m with\rvisible wood decay. Structural weakness from the old tear out wound. The tree in question ( tulip tree) is 21m high and 9m wide, we propose a 3m holistic reduction leaving the tree 18m high and 6m wide. \r\rT3 - walnut, fell due to excessive shading and low amenity value.",
