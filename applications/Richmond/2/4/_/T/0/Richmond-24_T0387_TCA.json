The canopy spread will remain untouched at 3.5m.\r \rT2 Horse Chestnut - Crown THIN the canopy evenly by up to 10%. Reduce back the lowest limb from the house and road by 1.5m to a suitable growth point to leave a finished branch lengths of 6m. Pruning cuts to be made to the nearest suitable growth point. This is not a height reduction.\rThe tree height will be unchanged and will remain at 10m. The finished canopy spread will be 6m. \r \rT3 Common Ash. Remove 1X LOWEST branch back to the main stem. This branch is situated @ 4m in height over the garden. Carry out a lateral reduction back from the house side on the west aspect of the tree by 2m to leave an approx. finished branch length of 3m. The lateral reduction back from the building will be done to the nearest suitable growth point and will leave a natural flowing shape. This is a lateral reduction not a height reduction. The tree height will be unchanged and will remain at 11.5m. The canopy spread will remain untouched on the east, south and west at 5m. The finished canopy spread to the north will be 3m.\r \rT6 Horse Chestnut - remove the epicormic growth from the tree to a height of 4m from ground level. The tree height will be unchanged and will remain at 9.5m. The canopy spread will remain untouched at 4.5m.\r \rT7 Lime - raise the canopy to create 4.5m ground to canopy clearance, prune to clear the fabric of the building on the east aspect by 2.5m to leave a finished branch length of 3m. The tree height will be unchanged and will remain at 12m. The finished canopy spread will be 4m. \rT8 Thuja Plicata - reduce back the lateral profile from over the garden of 57 to leave 1m growth length over the fence into the garden of number 57. Pruning cuts to be made to suitable growth points where possible.",
