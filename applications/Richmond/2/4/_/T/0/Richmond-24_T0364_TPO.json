  "description": "Dead/ diseased TPO ash tree is immediately to the left of our driveway (facing the house from the street).\r\rThis tree has sadly been infected with 'King Alfred cakes' fungus and has died.\r\rOur gardener and qualified Tree surgeon has confirmed this and advised that the top of the tree has started to shed some of the small branches and will only get worse in time.\r\rAs the dead tree is very close to the roadside, there is risk that branches could fall on pedestrians and possibly cars.\rAdditionally, there is a risk that the tree could fall down due to the weight of the substantial larger main stem branches higher up.\r\rREQUEST FOR WORKS: To cut the tree down to about 3m to 4m in height, removing all auxiliary main branches and leaving just the single main trunk.",
