  "description": "Ginkgo biloba (no 8 on sketch plan) Remove and replace with more suitable trees as listed on sketch plan.  We have pruned the tree in the past in accordance with LBRUT guidance but it grows back very quickly.  Its increasing size has caused damage to the adjacent garden wall, which is jointly owned with our neighbours at  no 22, which we have had to repair.  In addition neighbours to the north east of our garden complain that the tree overshadows their garden for the whole summer and have requested that we take action to alleviate the nuisance.",
