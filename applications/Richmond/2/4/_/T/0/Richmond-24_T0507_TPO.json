  "description": "T001 - Cedar of Lebanon - reduction works and replacement of Cobra bracing -In general- a 3m crown reduction in width of crown diameter (1.5m radially) is proposed. This will be increased to 4m diameter reduction where there is sufficient remaining foliage to support increased branch reduction of up to 2.5m. No reduction in height is proposed. This leaves a canopy spread after reduction of generally 8m and in some places 7m and a height of 15m (from 11m diameter and 15m height being the current dimensions, prior to reduction works). \rIt is recommended that the canopy is reduced prior to the replacement of the bracing to reduce the weight and sail of the limbs. This will reduce the risk of movement in the process of replacing the bracing and reduce the forces acting on the new bracing and unions. As the vast majority of the canopy is supported, to some degree, with flexible bracing this work will equate to a full reduction of the crown but given the nature of the growth habit of the tree this reduction will take place to the upper to mid-section of the sides of the canopy. The upper central canopy and inward heading (towards the trunk) growth in the outsides of the upper canopy should be retained. So should growth that can safely be retained that may in the future become lower canopy growth and provide some dampening.\r\rThe flexible bracing should be replaced, like for like in as similar positions as possible as the existing bracing will have some impact on where the tree has put on reaction growth. In addition to the existing bracing, an additional section of bracing should be installed in the NW section of the canopy to provide some additional support beyond a potentially weakend union.",
