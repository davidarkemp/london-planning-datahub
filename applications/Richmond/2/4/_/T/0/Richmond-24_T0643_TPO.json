  "description": "Reduce back to the most recent previous reduction points, removing approx. 2-3m of new growth poles and no more than 50 percent of the growth poles at each reduction point/pollard head - to maintain furnishing growth, reduce the stress on the tree by limiting the amount of material removed, and lessen the visual impact of the crown reduction.  \r\rJustification/reason:\rTo reduce the impact of the trees dense crowns spreading and impacting further on the reasonable use of the play ground and play equipment below. To reduce the risk of new growth poles from the previous reduction failing. The trees are already in a reduction cycle, with the last management work carried out eight years ago. Most reduction points are showing some evidence of poor attachment which could lead to larger regrowth from each reduction point failing. The work specification should be sympathetic to the trees final appearance and amenity to the local area.",
