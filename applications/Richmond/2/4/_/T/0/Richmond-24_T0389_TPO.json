Current height - 18.5 meters - Proposed reduction of canopy by 5 meters\r\rPrevious application 23/T1041/TPO was refused for 5 meter reduction as it was deemed that there was insufficient information provided to support the reduction. \rWe would like to revisit this request - When T1 was removed, the decay within the stems reached down by 4 meters - please see the updated photos. \rWe have explained previously that there is visible decay noticeable when T1 was climbed and this tree does pose risk to life/property. Residents are concerned having a large tree so close to parking spaces and public areas with the amount of decay within the tree. For the safety of the residents we would like to request the reduction again with the additional supportive information.\r",
