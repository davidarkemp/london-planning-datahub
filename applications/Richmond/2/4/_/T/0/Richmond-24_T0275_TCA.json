  "description": "T1-Laburnum - Several of the trunks previously removed, remaining trunks in poor condition with pronounced lean over the public footpath\rSuggested works are to fell all trunks to ground level\r\rT2-Bay - Large mature tree not maintained in many years, encroaching on the rear elevation of no 156 and the neighbouring property\rSuggested works are to reduce height from 12m to 9m and lateral crown spread from 10m to 6m. This will create a neater, more manageable shape going forward\r\rT3-Eucalyptus - Very large tree previously heavily reduced on the Northern neighbouring side, no 158.\rThis has left an unbalanced crown with several extremely long and overweight lateral limbs.\rSuggested works are to selectively reduce upper canopy from 15m height to 13m height, leaving a natural rounded appearance.\rSelectively reduce all overlong and overweight lateral limbs over no 156. Taking the lateral spread from 6m to 3m \rHard to give exact measurements as each limb is different length",
