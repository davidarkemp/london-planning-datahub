  "description": "3 No. Leyland cypress trees - Fell\r\rReason :  inappropriate species for the location which have outgrown their location. Trees are damaged in several areas, are diseased and have very poor overall appearance. A Tree Survey in January 2022 by Clive Fowler Associates dated January 2022 and seen by the Council recommended their removal.\r\r1 No. Lawson cypress - Fell\r\rReason :  in a 2022 storm a large branch from the nearby Leyland cypress trees fell on to the Lawson cypress tree causing it to severely bend over the adjacent electrical substation. This caused a substantial vertical split in the trunk of the tree and in rectifying the overall damage the professional tree surgeons lopped 50% from the height of the tree.\r\rReplacement Trees - this is an inappropriate location to plant any tree that might become substantial in size.",
