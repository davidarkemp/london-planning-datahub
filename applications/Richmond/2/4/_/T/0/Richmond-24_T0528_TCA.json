Crab Apple\rPoor in health due to Apple Scab\rRear Garden:\rFell in sections to ground level.\rThe tree's current height is 9m and crown spread is 7m\rAfter the proposed works, the tree's height is 0m and the crown spread is 0m \r\rThe symptoms often first appear in late spring, when you'll see dark blotches (called lesions) on leaves, as well as a dark, velvety growth over the leaf surface. In summer, leaves turn yellow and fall prematurely, often leaving the tree mostly, or even completely, defoliated. Infected fruit are usually deformed and develop circular, rough spots on the skin. Fruit rot quickly and fall before ripening.",
