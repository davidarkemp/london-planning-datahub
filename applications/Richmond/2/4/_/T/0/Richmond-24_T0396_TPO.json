  "description": "Yew tree 1001 (T60 in TPO28)\rTree is an advanced state of decay and has recently lost a major limb through disintegration of a principal union. See arboricultural report.\r1. Remove south-eastern upright bough UB2 and the decayed bough stub immediately behind it within 13 weeks.\r2. Install a single element of proprietary purpose-made non-invasive bracing (e.g., Cobra(R) bracing) between upright boughs UB1 (north-eastern) & 3 (western). The brace shall be of a rating sufficient to withstand all anticipated loads and according to manufacturer's recommendations. The system should be installed in dynamic (i.e., non-pretensioned) mode using materials rated at 4t or above. Install within 13 weeks.\r3. Reduce the remaining crown regions by 25% by radius; equivalent to removing branch length as follows: N crown 1.3m; E crown 1.6m; W crown 1.75m\rReductions to be carried out by a combination of tip-pruning and / or pruning to growth points as appropriate. To be carried out within 1 year.\r4. Install purpose-made wooden props to support upright boughs UB2 & 3 within 1 year. Props may be made of wood, or similar, supported by metal fittings secured in 1m3 below-ground concrete blocks.",
