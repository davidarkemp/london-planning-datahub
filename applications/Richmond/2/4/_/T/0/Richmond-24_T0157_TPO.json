  "description": "Two large London Plane trees are causing cobbles on paths, roadways and driveways to lift and become potentially dangerous to users.\r\rWe have considered various options but can see no alternative other than to proceed with Option 2 in the report from Arboricultural Solutions dated April 2022.  We therefore propose lifting the affected cobbles around the trees and building up the sub-base with sharp sand over the top of the roots and then re-laying the blocks on top.  This will lift the level of the roadway, paths and driveways.  The levels will be increased to a required height to ensure the cobbles can be fully bedded and re-layed.  The surface will be cambered gently down to prevent a sharp rise in the level in the road.\r\rThe purpose of the proposed work is to prevent the need for the tree roots to be cut, shaved or damaged whilst maintaining the safe use of the roadway, paths and drives.",
