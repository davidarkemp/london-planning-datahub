  "description": "Rear/North Boundary Common Horse Chestnut:\rTree Inspected at ground level starting at buttress root flare and surrounding soils, all seem average for age of tree, no noticeable faults.\rMain fork, has a large split (0.50m) on both side of the trunk, indicating poor structural form.\rLarge limb failure at 6m (S.E facing).\rThe history of bracing would indicate x 2 installations, the first Installation 20+ years ago at 7m, and most recent (last 10 years) at 13m/14m. These are absolutely monumental in supporting tree stability and prevent catastrophic failure.\r\rThe supporting aids (Cobra Bracing) are at there limit, and potentially, will not be able to carry on supporting the tree without some weight, branch reduction work, to help manage prevent future failure of main fork area.\rRecommended Works:\rReduce crown height and spread by 3m to a natural rounded form, ensure branches are cut back to the best and most suitable points.\r- Remove dead branches. \r- Inspect old bracing (do not remove) and carry out climbing Inspection for adverse branch or higher junction faults. \rThe current height of the tree is approx. 23m\rThe current spread of the tree is approx. 25m\rThe proposed height of the tree following pruning is approx. 20m\rThe proposed spread of the tree following pruning is approx. 22m\r",
