This is merely routine pruning to ensure the health of the tree consistent with best practice for maintaining shape and rigour of a mature apple tree that I have maintained for 22 years since moving to the property. The pruning is mainly at the top of the crown where the branches grow vertically, and the tree is currently approximately 12m high.",
