  "description": "T1 - Birch. Approx 4m in height with a 2.5m lateral spread. \r\rProposed Works: Fell and grind due to damage caused by roots to paving slabs. \r\rT2 - Lime Tree. Approx 14m in height with an 8m lateral spread. \r\rProposed works: Reduce height by up to 2m and shape reducing laterals by no more than 1.5m. Thin throughout crown by 10% and any deadwood/crossing branches removed. Leaving a height of 12m a lateral spread of 6.5m. \r\rT3 - Lime tree, approx 10m in height with a 5m lateral spread. \r\rProposed works: Fell and grind. Tree in decline with over 50% of the crown dead and multiple dropped limbs. Suppressed by larger lime (T2) has also resulted in poor form and aesthetics.",
