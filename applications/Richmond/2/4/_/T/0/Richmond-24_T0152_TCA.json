  "description": "Location: w3w supply.task.switch, 515096,169455\rGroup of trees:  in yellow polygon on plan map, 1529. 12 trees (of which 1x 5 stem, 1x 4 stem, 1 x 2 stem) self seeded sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) 10-15 m height\rSpecification: Dismantle and fell\r\rStatement\rThe ongoing renovations of the Woodland Garden have included the installation of a new fence. The new fence line north-west of the Red Bridge is approximately 2m to the west of the old fence line, therefore this group of self-seeded sycamore is now to the east of the new fence.\rThe removal of these trees is appropriate as they are not consistent with the planting of the area (oak), and their removal will be compensated by the planting of more appropriate native species elsewhere.\rThe improvements to the surfaces of the paths through ash walk will follow.\rThe removal of the sycamore will improve sightlines across the bridge.",
