  "description": "This Salix babylonica is showing localised decay at several points, evidence of fungal growth and dieback in upper canopy, with dead wood throughout.  A storm took off a large branch that was overhanging the boundary to 23 Ham Farm Rd, 22nd Jan 2024.  In consultation with the arboricultural consultant, Nick Hayden, Hayden's Arboricultural Consultants Ltd, we are applying for permission to heavily pollard this willow to reduce the risk of further branch loss.  We also request permission to pollard a branch that will overhang proposed deck and pergola near the house, see 'Willow 1 - 25 HFR.png' as this will reduce risk of damage to this area.\rExisting canopy spread of c.14m will be reduced to c.10m with a c.2m reduction to spread in each direction, N to S.  Existing canopy height of c.13- 15m reduced by c. 3 -5m, leaving a canopy height of 8 - 10m.  In addition, the damaged branch that overhangs no.23 Ham Farm Road will be removed. ( see photos attached. ) Paul Maher, LBRuT Arboricultural Officer, having looked at the willow, recommended 2 large branches to be removed and possible reduction of branch overhanging deck + pergola.
