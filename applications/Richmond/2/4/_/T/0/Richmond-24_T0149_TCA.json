  "description": "T1 - Dead Apple: providing notice of intention to remove a dead apple tree (no sign of life for 2 years now). Intend to plant a prunus in a similar location to compensate for the loss of the apple.\rT2 - False Acacia: seeking permission to reduce by 30% the crown of this overgrown tree - tree height approx 9m and perhaps 5m at its widest - although it is quite narrow at certain points; the intention is to reduce the height by about 2.5m on this occasion; obviously this needs to be dealt with in the context of the canopy to keep the tree well proportioned in its confined space. This will probably mean an over all reduction in the width of around 1.5m at its widest point.\r",
