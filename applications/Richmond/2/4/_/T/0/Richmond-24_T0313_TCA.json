  "description": "We wish to trim the overhanging branches from our neighbours trees that over overhanging our fence boundary. They are significantly impacting us by a) blocking sunlight and b) causing the bushes/plants in our garden to start growing outwards instead of vertically (due to the pressure of the branches). There are 3 conifer trees (1, 2, 3) and one red maple - Current height of all trees: 10m; current canopy current spread is 9m - Then work to be done is prune back overhanging side by 3-4 metres for each tree, leaving trees that are still 10m high with a spread of 6m.",
