  "description": "Description of works: \r\rWe would like to prune Olive tree in back garden. The tree is currently approximately 4 metres high and 4 metres wide. The tree is getting old and the crown needs reducing so as it doesn't end up falling over in the wind. We would like to reduce the tree by 1 metre all over which would leave the tree at 3 metres high and 3 metres wide. We also want to thin it out a bit and remove dead wood. The tree is on the right hand side in the back garden. The garden is approx 5 metres long and the tree is positioned half way down by the fence.",
