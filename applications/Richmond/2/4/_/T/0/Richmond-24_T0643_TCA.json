  "description": "SENIORS PLAYGROUND\t\t\rG1 including report tag no.0014\tHolm Oak - Evergreen Oak (Quercus ilex) - 4 x trees - Reduce crowns to the most recent previous reduction points, removing approx. 2-3m of new growth but retaining some furnishing growth. For each tree, approximately: Final height 15-20m and final overall spread 8-12m.\r\rReasoning for tree works are that the trees have not been cut for around 8 years now. The Crowns are becoming dominant and overbearing. The bird mess is causing issues with the school playground equipment. Pruning work is to reduce the impact of the crown size and reduce the likelihood of bird mess.",
