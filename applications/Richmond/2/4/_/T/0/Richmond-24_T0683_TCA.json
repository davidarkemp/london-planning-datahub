  "description": "T1 Indian Bean tree, T2 Bay, T3 Bay.\rWe are seeking to reduce T1 by up to 1m not exceeding most recent pruning points. The reduction will involve removing a meter over the entirety of the crown as it has a ball like growth structure, once this has been completed the crown will be reduced from 6m to 5m.\rWe are also seeking permission to reduce T2 and T3 by up to 1.5m not exceed most recent pruning points. The Bay trees are very similar in growth structure and size, we will be removing 1.5m from the height of the crown and 1m from the sides. The trees will be reduced from 6m in height to 4.5m and 4m in width to 3m. Once again this work will not exceed the most recent growth points.",
