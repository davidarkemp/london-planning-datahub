  "description": "Magnolia tree in front garden of 27 Sandycoombe Road TW1 2LU. \r\rRequest to prune the magnolia tree by crown thinning to the previous pruning points. To reduce the crown by a maximum of 2 metres in height and 2 metres in width, leaving a canopy spread of 4 metres and height of 5.5 metres. This is in order to maintain the health of the tree and prevent storm damage as the upper crown has become leggy. In addition we wish to encourage growth lower in the crown. All works will be carried out with a pruning saw by a professional tree surgeon.",
