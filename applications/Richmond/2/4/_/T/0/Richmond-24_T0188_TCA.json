  "description": "Sketch Plan: LebPkHolly1\rIlex (Holly) tree for removal - tree planted in raised bed by previous house owner. As a result, it fails to get the water it needs during the summer and its leaves drop constantly. Its upper branches are looking bare too and generally not thriving.\rProposal to plant a small garden tree, such as crab apple, in its place at ground level (remove raised bed) to give it better chance of thriving.",
