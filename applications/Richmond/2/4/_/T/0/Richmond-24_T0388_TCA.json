  "description": "5 DAY DANGEROUS TREE NOTICE\rCutting down or pruning a tree which presents an imminent and serious safety risk; Specification: T2 Acacia- Fell to ground level. I climbed the tree today 9th May 2024. To remove ivy engulfing the tree. Removal of ivy revealed severe bark necrosis on the lower trunk, further investigation at the base of the tree showed that the base is suffering from rot possibly caused by phytophthora. Upon climbing the tree to remove the ivy when I was half way up (approximately 4.5 metres) any movement I made caused the entire trunk to move right to the base. We did a stability test with a rope up the tree with one person pulling and one observing, the entire tree was moving as was the soil/ground at the base of the tree with each pull.",
