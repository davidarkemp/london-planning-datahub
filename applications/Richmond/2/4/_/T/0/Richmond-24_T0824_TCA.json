  "description": "T1 Scots Pine - growing over the garden of number 57 Ham street to the north remove the 3X lowest branches back to the main stem. The branches are  situated @ 5m, 6m and 7m in height from ground level. The finished tree height will remain untouched at its current height of 14m. The finished radial canopy spread will be approx. 5.6m.\rT2 Scots Pine - remove 3X lowest branches growing over the garden of number 57 Ham street to the north back to the stem. The branches are situated @ 6m, 7m and 8m in height from ground level. Shorten back 2X branches @ 9m and 10m in length by 1.5m to leave a finished branch length of approx. 4.1m. All reduction pruning points are to be made to suitable secondary growth points and drop crotch style pruning will be used. The finished tree height will remain untouched at its current height of 12.5m. The finished radial canopy spread will be approx. 5.m.\rThe trees are situated over the neighbours BBQ area and garden. Whilst the trees are visible from the roads only the top portions are due to the tree lined boundaries of 57 Ham street. even when the boundary trees are not in leaf the lower part of the canopies of t1 and 2 are obscured by the silhouettes of other trees. The work recommended is of a holistic approach to maintaining a balanced relationship with the owners of the neighbouring property, their enjoyment of their garden and the trees health. By removing the lower branches on the northern side this will give less encroachment into their small garden and give enhanced light to the property. The two branches to be reduced back on t2 will reduce the end weight and lessen the chances of branch end failures. The reduction work will so minimal and will generally go un notices by the untrained eye as the canopy will flow pruning to suitable secondary growth points. I feel this work is of good arboricultural practice.",
