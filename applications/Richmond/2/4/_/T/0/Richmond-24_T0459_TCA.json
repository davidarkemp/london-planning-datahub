  "description": "Rear Garden:\rTo follow up on my site visit, and inspection of the Balsam Poplar.\rThe tree is located on the north boundary adjoining the garden of 53 Park Road.\r\rMeeting with the resident of 53 Park Road, regarding issue's with light and root related problem, mainly lifting of slabs and fence post.\rThe Tree is completely blocking any natural daylight entering the garden.\rTo help resolve these issue's the first requirement, would be to reduce the tree in volume substantially and then follow up with further root investigations to assess and hopefully initiate some root pruning to facilitate relaying of patio slabs.\r\rSuggested Works:  \rReduce height down to a 6m trunk and reduce crown spread to clear all overhang to 53 Park Road and a further 2.5m to balance the crown. \rThe tree's current height is 19m and crown spread is 7m\rAfter the proposed works, the tree's height is 6m and the crown spread is 4.5m",
