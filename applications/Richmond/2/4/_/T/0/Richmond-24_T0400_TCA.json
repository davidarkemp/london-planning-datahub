  "description": "Large Turkey Oak in back garden of 21 The Avenue. We wish to raise the crown in order to have some light in the garden - believe that the tree it 22-23 meters tall and 15 meters approximately in diameter. The lowest branches are approximately 3.5 meters from ground level. We are seeking permission to raise the crown by 3-4 meters which would mean the resulting crown would still be 15-16 meters and 15 meters in diameter and obviously the tree itself would remain the same height - 22-23 meters.",
