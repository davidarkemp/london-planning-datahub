  "description": "Request for permission to fell a Betula Pendula, Silver birch tree because of concerns of its dying condition and the risk of it falling on adjacent properties causing property damage and potentially hurting people passing by or damaging vehicles driving by on the street. The branches dying back during the summer months with the leaves turning brown and the dead stems at the top are the main indications that cause my client and his neighbours concern of the health of the tree and therefore of its questionable stability in the coming months. Concerns have become more prominent since another tree fell on its own during a storm on the adjacent road (St Mary's Grove) a couple of weeks ago.\rWe'd also like to ask for permission to plant a Liquidambar Styraciflua to replace the Betula Pendula that we are requesting to fell.",
