  "description": "Bay(Laurus nobilis)-3x large stems\rHt-16m Spread-7m\rDBH-40cm each stem\rDAB-1m\r-section fell to ground level & grind stump \r\rThe tree overwhelms the garden being too large for the space available to it and for the position it occupies. It has, as a result of being a shrub, three main trunks which spread upwards and outwards hence it is thought there cannot be a reduction programme such that it can be successfully controlled. Its root system is large and wide which root system prevents the growth of anything in a substantial proportion of the garden as a whole. Further, its root system is also problematic with existing underground drains for the house. It casts shade across a substantial part of the garden materially reducing overall amenity. Our neighbours are affected by it and have directly asked on a number of occasions if there are plans for it to be removed. Replacement suitable planting is planned following the removal of the tree.",
