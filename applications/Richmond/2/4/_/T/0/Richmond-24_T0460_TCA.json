  "description": "The tree is a hazel tree. It is located in the front garden of the property next to the front boundary wall and the boundary with the garden of 109 White Hart Lane. This application is seeking permission to reduce and re-shape the crown of the tree by pruning it back to the previous pollarded height (see Planning application number: 21/T0948/TCA-Decided the Council raises no objection 04/01/2022). This is a reduction of around 3-4 metres in height and about 5-6 metres in diameter - Proposed canopy size post-reduction: 2 mtrs wide by 1.5 mtrs high - The tree has grown substantially since it was last pollarded and is causing excessive shade to the property and to the neighbouring property (109). In addition, the branches are now overhanging both the pavement and the public highway. As the branches have increased in length they have started to hang lower and are getting in the way of some pedestrians. On the sketch plan the tree is the large circle that has been labelled 'tree'.",
