  "description": "1. Fell Holly (labelled T1 in attached 'Tree survey and site map) to ground level and remove stump by machine grinding. Rationale: tree is close to property and limits natural light. \r\r2. Whole crown reduction of Apple (labelled T5 in attached Tree survey and site map) by 1.5-1.75m in width and height (ca. 30%), to achieve canopy spread of 3.85-4m and height of 3.5-4m. Rationale: RICS survey advised regular pruning of trees to minimise risk of subsidence. Apple tree has not been significantly pruned since we moved into property in 2021.\r\r3. Crown reduction of Cherry (labelled T6 in attached Tree survey and site map) by 1-2m in width and height to achieve canopy spread of 4m and height of 3.5-4m. Rationale: 1. RICS survey advised regular pruning of trees to minimise risk of subsidence. Cherry tree has not been significantly pruned since we moved into property in 2021. 2. To improve tree aesthetically. \r\rWork will be carried out by a qualified tree surgeon.\r\rWe intend to introduce new trees to garden through landscaping works. These are likely to include: 5 x 3.5m tall beech or evergreen pleached trees screening off rear of garden; b) Four structural trees: Multi stemmed birches or Amelanchier circa 2m tall and Acer palmatum blood garnet circa 1.5m tall.\r",
