  "description": "Rear Garden:\rRobinia 25% Reduction, pruning back branches by 1.5 - 2m. Leaving an even balanced canopy. The Robinia at present is 20m tall / 10m wide. My client would like the regrowth pruned back to the old points, leaving 75cm - 1m lengths of growth from the old points ( the thick bits ) Therefore pruning back the regrowth by 1.5 - 2m. So the overall height of the Robinia will be 18m, with a canopy width of 7.5m\rReasons for works:\rGeneral maintenance,\rLight issues,\rConsideration to neighbours.",
