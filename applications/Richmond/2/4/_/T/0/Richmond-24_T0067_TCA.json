Black Mulberry Ancient tree, 250+ years old, multi-stemmed with major decay with main fork. \r\rSince Darryl's previous visit, it appears that, some movement has occurred, although very slight, with the existing bracing doing its job,\rpreventing full failure. \r\rPreviously 'Cobra' braced, x 2 braces which are now degrading & in poor condition, needing replacement, I would also strongly advise an addition, 'Heavier duty', brace is installed.\r\ra) Reduce three main stems by 2.5m to reduce weight-loading,\rRemove deadwood.
