  "description": "T2 Oak 12m high  - Fell\r\rReasons: Although not yet fully grown, has already reached a considerable size. Its continued growth poses significant concerns due to its location and the impact on the property. I wish to outline the key reasons why removal is not only advisable but necessary:\r\r1. Proximity to the Houses and buildings \rThe tree is situated dangerously close to the house. As it continues to grow, the root system will expand further, potentially leading to structural damage to the foundations of the property. Additionally, the proximity increases the risk of falling branches, which could cause significant harm to the property or its occupants, especially during adverse weather conditions.\r\r2. Previous Pruning and Maintenance\rThe trees continued expansion has proven difficult to control. The regular pruning required to keep the tree at bay is not only unsustainable but also diminishes the tree's aesthetic and structural integrity.\r\r3. Impact on the Property\rThe tree casts substantial shadow over the property, significantly reducing natural light within the home. This not only affects the living conditions but could also contribute to dampness and other issues commonly associated with limited sunlight exposure. The tree's overhanging branches also extend over the roof, posing a continuous risk of damage to the roofing structure.\r\r4. Future Growth Potential\rGiven that the tree is not yet fully grown, it is expected to continue expanding both in height and breadth. This will exacerbate all the aforementioned concerns, further endangering the property and its occupants. The tree's removal now, while it is still manageable, is a prudent measure to prevent future complications that may arise from its unchecked growth.\r\r5. Alternative Mitigation Measures\rWhile pruning and other maintenance...",
