  "description": "T1 - Cedar. Approx 25m in height with a 16m lateral spread. *Please note tree previously lion tailed - Very sparce first few metres on every limb with extremely dense end loading.\rProposed Works: Thin crown to reduce end loading on very dense limbs after multiple limb failures this year. Deadwood to be removed. Cutback one limb which is now 30cm from front of building to create 2m clearance only. (There will be no change to height or shape)\rT2 - Bay Approx 8m in height with a 5m lateral spread. Tree previously trimmed into shape every year, now lapsed and allowed to become overgrown. \rProposed Works: Reduce in height by 2m and laterally by 1m - reduction will leave the tree 6m in height with a 4m lateral spread.",
