  "description": "T1: Portuguese Laurel - Prunus Lusitanica.\rSituated in the far SW corner of the property just within a retaining cornew of wall/closeboard fence and garage peir, where the foot path running alongside the railway line turns the corner onto Crofton Terrace. The canopy is 5m in height and 4m approx spread over the footpath and garage roof/entranceway. The structural scaffold limbs are becoming significant with 20cm diameter and a larger main stem and buttresses.\r\rWorks requested to remove by sectional felling tree to ground level.\r\rThis tree removal proposal is justified by the combined destructive effect the tree is causing to the brick wall corner and concrete and timber fencline alongside the cover seems to it offer for ongoing and disruptive illegeal activities on the corner of the property. It currently presents an ongoing trimming requirement away from the footpath becoming increasingly difficult for the homeowner. As the front and rear gardens are largely overgrown with many varieties of well establishes trees, shrubs, hedging, border and climbing plants, the loss is deemed a justifiable loss to the overall green cover. The species itself Portuguese Laurel is proposed as not of specif aminity value.",
