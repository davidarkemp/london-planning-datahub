  "description": "1. Tree of Heaven.\tA small mature self-sown tree growing against the base of the boundary walling. A very fast-growing species, root expansion growth has caused displacement of the listed boundary wall foundation which has collapsed during the recent high winds. The tree & its root system needs removal before the boundary wall can be rebuilt, the tree is in a Conservation Area the council will require Notification.The remaining section of boundary wall will need to be removed to access the tree's stump.\rWorks Recommended: Fell to ground level & grind out stump to allow boundary wall reconstruction.\r\r2. Walnut.\tThis tree is dead being severely infected with a root rotting fungal infection. It is laying onto the back of the outbuilding, leaning towards the garden area and is a main support for the garden canopy. \r(See Photo 2: Walnut basal fungal growths, Photo 3: Tree from South)\rWorks Recommended: It requires short term removal before its failure but replacement support for the canopy is urgently required.",
