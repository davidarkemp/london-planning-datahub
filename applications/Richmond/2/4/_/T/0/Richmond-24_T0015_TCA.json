On land within the boundary of 60 Rosemont Road expose a tree root, cut through and remove (shown in red on the sketch plan). Reasons for removal of tree root: Root growth has lifted the paving slabs in the existing pathway leading to No 11 Queens Road. The pathway is in my ownership (60 Rosemont Road) and forms a right of way granted to the owners of 11 Queens Road under Land Registry Title SGL166335. Currently the lifted slabs are a trip hazard which is a danger to the users of the pathway. Once the root has been removed the paving slabs will be re-laid flush with the adjoining slabs.",
