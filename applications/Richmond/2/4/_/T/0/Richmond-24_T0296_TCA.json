  "description": "T1. Bay Tree \rThe tree's current height is 7m and crown spread is 4m - After the proposed works, the height of the tree is 4.5m and the crown spread is 3.5m \r\rRear Garden (NE Boundary)\rReduce height by 2.5m and trim lateral spread by 0.50m to shape.\r\rG2. Laurel/Cypress/Photinia\rRear Garden: NW/NE/SE Boundaries:\rThe shrubs and trees surrounding the rear garden provide excellent screening and seclusion but have become slightly overgrown. The pruning required is very selective and will require a good level of thought to achieve management and retention of cover.\rThe general specification is to prune the back overhang to the garden by 1m-2m and height reductions of up to 2m (not in a hedge format) but to allow light into the garden and not to compromise shade where needed.\rThe tree's current average height is 8m and the crown spread is 6m - After the proposed works, the height of the tree is 6m and the crown spread is 4/5m \r\rT3. Goat Willow\rRear Garden:\rReduce height by 4m back to previous points - Reduce crown spread by 4m to previous points to balance.\rThe tree's current height is 9m and crown spread is 7m - After the proposed works, the height of the tree is 5m and the crown spread is 6m",
