  "description": "Front Garden (Front Boundary) \r\rT7: Magnolia tree - Fell to ground level, grind out stump  \rheight 4m & spread 4m. Reduce height to 0m & spread to 0m\r\rT8: Silver birch tree - Fell to ground level, grind out stump \t\rheight 5m & spread 3m. Reduce height to 0m & spread to 0m\r\rReason for works: \rThe residents in the house are both over 85 years old. In the spring. the petals of the white magnolia flowers cover the entire front of the house, they are very slippery and a real hazard to the two 85-year-olds. Autumn and Winter present even greater hazard; the leaves ot the Magnolia cover the entire front of the house and being so slippery present a serious danger to the 85-year-olds. The residents find it impossible to clear Magnolia petals and leaves. The residents have in mind to replace the Magnolia with a less hazardous and more decorative plant. The tall Birch tree is now dead and branches are falling off. In summary, the sooner these two trees are cut down the safer it will be for the residents.",
