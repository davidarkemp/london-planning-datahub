  "description": "We would like to remove a medium sized cherry that has been planted in a sleeper raised bed. The tree is approximately 4-4.5m high, the trunk splits into 2 at 0.8m above ground level. At 0.8m above ground level, the trunk is approximately 15cm in diameter. The tree does not grow well here, perhaps because it sits in heavy shade, with its roots having limited space to grow. The tree is in poor condition overall. Our client would like to remove the tree as part of a new landscaping scheme where 2 x 10-12 M/S size Silver Birch and 2 x multi stem Acers in 50L pots will be introduced.",
