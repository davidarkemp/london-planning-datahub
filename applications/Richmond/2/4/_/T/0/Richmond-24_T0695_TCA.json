  "description": "A cherry tree directly outside the front entrance to 7 Station Road is causing damage to the brick wall surrounding the property. The tree is falling over and resting on the external structure which is causing cracks in the brickwork and a safety risk to those passing the property as the brickwork is becoming unstable. \rThe tree is in a poor state with much of the tree dead. The photo was taken mid-summer and shows little to no growth. \rIt is requested the tree can be removed and replaced with laurel bushes which is in keeping with the current external hedging.",
