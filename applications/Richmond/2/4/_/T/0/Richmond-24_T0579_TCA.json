  "description": "T1 is a large mature Eucalyptus Tree located at the bottom of the garden of 20 St Margarets Drive close to a 3m brick wall. \rThe branches of the tree are overhanging into Clifton Lodge (Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance) which neighbours 20 St Margarets Drive. Branches from the Eucalyptus Tree are causing damage to the guttering of the Sainsbury Studio lower and upper roofs.\rWe have consulted with the owners of the tree (20 St Margarets Drive) and they are happy for it to be pruned to reduce the branches that are currently overhanging onto the roofs. - The current height of the tree is 12m high by 8 meters wide. The crown height and width reduction will be 1.5m from the height and 1m either side for the width (2m in total). \rFollowing the completion of the works we anticipate that the size will be 10.5m high by 6 meters wide.",
