  "description": "T1 - Lime Tree. Approx 18m in Height and 6m lateral spread. \r\rLime tree has been heavily reduce in the past, with current state of tree having a stem of 14m in height and 6m lateral spread with the remaining 4m of height being regrowth. We now propose (due to rejection of re-pollard back to previous pruning points) a reduction of 2m from the height and 0.5-1m from the lateral limbs in order to reduce the end loading of the regrowth in case of failure due to weak attachment points which due to the species is high risk. \r\rSummary: Reduction in height of up to 2 metres and of 0.5 - 1m laterallly.",
