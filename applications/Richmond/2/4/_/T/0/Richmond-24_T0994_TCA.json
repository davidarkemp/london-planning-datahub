  "description": "T1. Malus (Apple Tree)\rProposed Works: Reduce the crown by approximately 2-3m (40%) back to old pruning points. Retain hanging branches for privacy.\rFinished Height: Approximately 3-4m.\rFinished Width: Approximately 4-5m.\rJustification: Routine maintenance\r\rT2. Magnolia\rProposed Works: Remove basal and epicormic growth. Reduce the tree by 1-2m (30%). Trim back to ensure a 1.5m clearance from the streetlight.\rFinished Height: Approximately 4-5m.\rFinished Width: Approximately 4-5m.\rJustification: The works ensure safety by maintaining clearance around the streetlight, improve overall shape and size, and support the tree's health by removing epicormic growth.\r\rT3. Conifer (Rear Garden)\rProposed Works: Reduce all around by 1-2m (30%) and trim to tidy.\rFinished Height: Approximately 4-5m.\rFinished Width: Approximately 3-4m.\rJustification: The reduction will contain the tree's size, prevent encroachment on adjacent properties, and improve aesthetics.\r\rT4. Portuguese Laurel\rProposed Works: Prune back by approximately 2-3m to appropriate pruning points while maintaining the shape.\rFinished Height: Approximately 4m.\rFinished Width: Approximately 3-4m.\rJustification: The works will manage the tree's size, maintain its shape, and prevent encroachment while ensuring the health and stability of the tree.\r\rT5. Cherry Laurel\rProposed Works: Prune back by 2-3m, reduce height by 3-4m, and trim to tidy.\rFinished Height: Approximately 3-4m.\rFinished Width: Approximately 3m.\rJustification: The works address size management, improve light penetration, and maintain the tree's structural health.\r\rT6. Laurel and Conifer\rProposed Works: Reduce height by 1-2m, prune back by 1m, and trim to tidy.\rFinished Height: Approximately 3-4m.\rFinished Width: Approximately 2-3m.\rJustification: Reduction and pruning are necessary to prevent overgrowth, improve appearance, and maintain manageable dimensions.\r\rT7.
