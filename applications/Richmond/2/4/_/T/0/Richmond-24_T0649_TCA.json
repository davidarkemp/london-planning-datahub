  "description": "Tree: Aesculus hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) (Number 7 on plan)\rI wish to have this tree felled and removed.  It was a self-seeded tree here when I moved into the property 33 years ago.  It has now reached a size that is incompatible with the trees either side of it.  On one side are 5 lime trees with TPO's and on the other side a very large Eucalyptus tree.  The Horse Chestnut continued growth will be constrained by these existing trees.  Its lateral growth already extends to the house roof which results in over shading the house and a huge amount of leaf fall in the autumn.  Aesthetically, it interferes with enjoyment of the limes and the eucalyptus.  The property has a second Horse Chestnut on the St Georges Road boundary and there is also a Horse Chestnut planted by the Council on the triangle of grass adjoining the property.  I cannot see that the Horse Chestnut I wish to remove will be missed. \rI have consulted three qualified tree surgeons and am awaiting quotes for the work.",
