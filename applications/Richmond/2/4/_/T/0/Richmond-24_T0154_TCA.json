  "description": "Tree 1 -  Apple tree in the rear garden.  Request to prune the overall canopy. \rCurrent height - 7 meters\rCurrent Width - 5.5 meters\r\rReduction requested -\rOne meter reduction of all branches to reduce the tree to 6 meters in height and reduce the width to 4.5 meters \r\rReasons for pruning -\rThe tree is exceeding the width of garden and growing into neighbor's boundary and out grown the small rear garden which is 9 meters by 5.5 meters. \rWhen the tree is in full leaf, at it's current size it blocks natural light to the rear kitchen and upper rear bedroom. \rThe tree has a hollow trunk and weight of the canopy could put the tree at risk of damage in high winds. \rThe large annual growth of the tree means it require regular pruning to keep the size of the tree under control. \r\rDate for works -\rLate February, early March 2024 depending on the application approval date. Or February 2025 to coincide with the trees dormant period",
