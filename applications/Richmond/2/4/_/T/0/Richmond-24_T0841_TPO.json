  "description": "TR1 - Poplar tree - The healthiest of the four poplar trees. This has a significant lean to the east which is with the common prevailing wind direction of 70% of winter storms \r\rTR2 - Poplar tree - Significant amount of dead wood including large parts of the stem and has a significant lean to the east which is with the common prevailing wind direction of 70% of winter storms \r\rTR3 - Poplar tree  - Significant amount of dead wood with a significant lean to the east which is with the common prevailing wind direction of 70% of winter storms \r\rTR4 - Poplar tree - Significant amount of dead wood with a significant lean to the east which is with the common prevailing wind direction of 70% of winter storms \r\rThese four trees are over a walk way which provides access to 3 occupied building. These are 70ft trees that have the potential to demolish a building if they were to fail. One tree on this line failed at the root ball in August of 2020 which showed that the trees have no more than 18 inches of soil and the roots have not rooted lower than the soil. I have pictures of this tree fallen after it narrowly missed a tenant. The picture of the root ball can show the depth of the soil as the island was built up with gravel from Thames Waters Filter beds We have also had a stem snap off of one of the still standing trees and damage our building. The significant lean can be seen in P05 and P06.\r\rWe would like to dismantle and fell all four of these trees to ensure public safety and mitigate the risk of damaging a building\r\rTR5 - Ash Tree - The tree snapped at the stem in the winds in January of this year leaving a 20ft stem. The stem this year had resprouted with epi growth. The concern is that with a year of no to little leaves and insufficient amount of leaves for the next several years the trees heath will deuterate further. In several years the will be a sail for the wind risking the chance for the tree to fail again and potentially hit a building / injure or ki",
