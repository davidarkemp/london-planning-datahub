  "description": "The pdf copy plan (#01) shows the location of 13 Twickenham Road. \r\rAt the end of the garden were three Acacia trees planted some 20 years ago. They provided privacy for us and the bungalow at the end of the garden (8 St Albans Gardens). Two of the trees flourished but one did not. \r\rAs a result of recent storms the two trees which had established successfully were unfortunately blown over (see photos #04 and 05) causing damage including destruction of a child's playhouse and a garden statue (as can be seen from the photos). Fortunately no-one was hurt but the trees need to be removed (see the urgent Council decision TA0031).\r\rConsent is therefore requested for the removal of the remaining Acacia (shown on the location plan marked X nearest the boundary with 11 Twickenham Road and on photos #02 and 03). This had never properly taken and looks likely to fall over since it is no longer supported by the now fallen trees. It also prevents replanting along this boundary.\r\rThe X on the location plan at the other end of the boundary and nearest to 15 Twickenham Road marks an Elder (see photo #06) which must have self planted itself at least 40 years ago and had never come to much because of other surrounding trees.  This Elder has been damaged by the recent storms and consent is requested for its removal.\r\rProspectively we will want to replace the Acacias with pleached trees such as Photinia similar to those planted at the end of the garden of 9 Twickenham Road.  \r\rSensibly the trees still standing will be removed at the same time as the fallen trees and the ground cleared for replanting so we would encourage the Council to make a similar decision for the two remaining trees as it has taken for the fallen trees rather than allow a 6 weeks delay. \r\rConsent therefore is urgently requested for \r1.  the removal of the Acacia (shown on the location plan marked X nearest the boundary with 11 Twickenham Road and on photos #02 and 03) and\r2.  the removal of...",
