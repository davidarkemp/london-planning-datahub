  "description": "Our client has been dealing with his insurance company and they have suggested that the trees are reduced to a height of no more than the distance from the base of the tree to the boundary of the property to reduce any risk of falling trees hitting property (trees adjacent to the boundary wall of house). \rT1. Holm Oak\r2 meter crown reduction in width and 2 meter height reduction leaving a canopy spread of approximately 2 meters and height of approximately 2.5 meters. The trees are encroaching upon the property and are starting to outgrow their current position. Without the works, the trees may start to cause damage to the wall as well as posing a risk to the property should they fall. \r\rT2. Holm Oak\r2 meter crown reduction in width and 2 meter height reduction leaving a canopy spread of approximately 2 meters and height of approximately 2.5 meters. The trees are encroaching upon the property and are starting to outgrow their current position. Without the works, the trees may start to cause damage to the wall as well as posing a risk to the property should they fall.\r\rG1. Ash trees x 4\r2 meter crown reduction in width and 2 meter height reduction leaving a canopy spread of approximately 3 meters and height of approximately 4 meters. The trees are encroaching on the property, and the overhang into the garden needs to be removed. These works will ensure that the trees maintain a smaller size suitable for the location. Without the suggested works, the trees may start to cause damage to the wall as well as posing a risk to the property should they fall.",
