  "description": "T1. Deodar Cedar\rFront Garden:\rA tree of great significance and Importance to the area. It appears the tree has had some fairly hefty storm damage re: 1987 storm, and had the top blown out, it's recovered very well, but has had no maintenance for some years, as a result has started to drop smaller branches, and has produced a significant amount of dead branches as expected.\rThe x 2 lowest branches which over extend to and face N.E & S.E towards 157b are extending outside the crown line, and causing some anxiety regarding the possibility of potential failure.\rGiven its current condition, it would be beneficial for deadwood removal and weight reduction of the afore mentioned lowest branches to help lessen the risk of failure.\rRecommendation for essential works:\rRemove all dead branches over 2.5 cm in diameter. \rThin branch ends by 10% to reduce length by 2m on the lowest N.E and S.E limbs which extend towards 157b  (Not supporting or crossing) and to lessen weight and increase stability.\rCarry out climbing Inspection and observation of branch junctions to ascertain structural integrity of main frame work. \rThe tree's current height is 23m and crown spread is 19m\rAfter the proposed works, the tree's height is 23m and the crown spread is 17m (x 2 Lowest Limbs only)",
