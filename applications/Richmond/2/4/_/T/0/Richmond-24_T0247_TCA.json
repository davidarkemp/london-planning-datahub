  "description": "Identification of trees and description of works\r\rWe are planning to improve an area of Clifton Lodge grounds in order to create usable garden space for our students to enjoy. The creation of this space will involve the planting of a new native tree which will be more appropriate for this space, new natve planting and a new circular bench to create a tranquil seating area. This area will provide our students and visitors with a much needed comtemplative space to provide rest and reflection time outside of their intensive dance training, whilst also enhancing the historic relevance of Clifton Lodge as a former orangery within the extensive gardens of the former St Margaret's estate. \r\rT1 Tree of Heaven\rT1 Fell - the tree is visibly damaging the pavement of the public right of way on the other side of our boundary. The pavement has been damaged requiring it to be previously repaired and the tree is damaging the brickwork of our boundary fence.\r\rT2 Elder tree \rFell due to overcrowding. It is not a tree of amenity\r\rT3 Ash tree \rFell - this is an unplanted wild tree\r\rT4 Hawthorne tree (Crataegus monogyna) The tree measures 5m high by 2m wide - We are proposing a crown reduction of 0.5m in width and 1.5m in height - Once the crown reduction has been completed the remaining tree would be 3.5m high and 1.5m wide\r\r\r\rOur proposed tree works have been advised by arborculturist J A Sykes",
