To make the proposed phasing of the development more explicit (Phase 1 - the Workshop element inc. the retrospective item referred to in the development description, and Phase 2 - the Residential element).  \r2. To allow CIL payments to be phased accordingly \r3. The existing extensions to the Workshop element are currently the subject of LBRUT Enforcement action and need to be resolved in short order, hence their identification in a discrete Phase 1.",
