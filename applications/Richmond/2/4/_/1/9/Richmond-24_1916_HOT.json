  "description": "1. Demolish and reconstruct garden front wall, increasing pier height to incorporate decorative ironwork comparable to other properties in the street.  As of today, the old wall has been demolished.\r2. Installation of a wooden, secure bicycle store to the right rear of the front garden requiring a hard standing for installation. As of today, preparation of the ground has commenced for creation of the hard standing though the store specified has a 3-month delivery time.\r\rWorks commenced earlier than expected as the contractor started on the neighbouring property and needed to take up a significant part of the pathway at No18 in order to access the water main for No 20. This then made it more efficient to perform works at No 18 concurrently.",
