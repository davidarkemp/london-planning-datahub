    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its siting, depth, height and massing would result in a visually intrusive and overbearing form of development that would create a sense of enclosure, to the detriment of the amenity of neighbouring occupiers, in particular no. 44 Windsor Road. Therefore, the proposal is in conflict with the Local Plan (2018), in particular Policy LP8 as well as policy 46 of the Publication Local Plan and the House Extensions and External Alterations SPD."
