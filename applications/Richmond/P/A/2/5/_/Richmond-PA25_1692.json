All trees are inspected annually and an active replanting scheme is in place.\r\nT7 - London Plane - tip reduce branches on Western side of canopy only to allow 2m clearance from neighbouring property to avoid canopy becoming a nuisance in future, as has been done for many years.\r\nT8 - London Plane - tip reduce branches on Western side of canopy only to allow 2m clearance from neighbouring property to avoid canopy becoming a nuisance in future, as has been done for many years.\r\nT9 - London Plane - tip reduce branches on Western side of canopy only to allow 2m clearance from neighbouring property to avoid canopy becoming a nuisance in future, as has been done for many years.\r\nG16 - Birch in centre of group, nearest to main road (Waldegrave Road) - fell - nearly dead\r\nT21 - Copper Beech - cut back Eastern side of canopy overhanging no. 4 Fieldend by up to 1.5m to reduce overhang over property and reduce nuisance to leave spread of ~10m (no reduction in height)\r\nT24 - Horse Chestnut - Re-pollard back to previous pruning points/knuckles as last done in 2018 (18/T0530/TPO) and many years beforehand to maintain size of canopy due to proximity next to wall and building. \r\nT88 - Group of Birch - cut back southern side of canopy of Birch closest to no. 17 Fieldend by 1.5m to allow 2m clearance from Building as squirrels are using the tree to access the building and causing damage to the roof and guttering. finished height is unchanged and spread is  5m\r\nT137 - Silver Birch - Fell - tree is in decline, large cavity at 2m, dead wood throughout canopy, die back from the top and a snap out of a main leader recently.
