  "description": "Tree 2 - Prunus ssp - Carry out a crown reduction of approximately 40%, equating to a reduction of 3 meters in height and 2 meters in lateral spread. This will reduce the overall height from 8 meters to approximately 5 meters, and result in a final canopy spread of approximately 3 meters. Additionally, remove all dead wood and carry out light shaping to maintain a balanced, natural appearance.\r\n\r\nTree 5 - Malus spp - Fell tree and remove stump. The tree is dead and poses a potential safety risk due to falling limbs due to a crack in the trunk. Replace with either Sargent's Cherry Blossom Tree | Prunus sargentii or Acer rubrum 'Autumn Flame' Tree.",

    "For Tree 2 - The specification is not suitable and therefore needs to be confirmed. The specification needs to be measurable and quantifiable so that we can understand the amount that is to be removed in meters. We need to know the amount to be removed and the remaining crown size. E.g. 2m crown reduction in width and 2m reduction in height, leaving a canopy spread of 3m and height of 5m"
