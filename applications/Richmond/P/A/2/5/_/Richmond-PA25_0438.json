    "The application, by reason of its designation as a Grade II* listed building, its siting within the Sheen Road Richmond Conservation Area, and absence of a proper heritage assessment, or detailed plans showing the extent of fabric loss and new work, has failed to describe the significance of heritage assets affected, or demonstrate that the development will not result in harm to designated heritage asset(s).  The impact on the asset cannot be weighed against any public benefits as required by Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act and paragraphs 212–216 of the NPPF.  The development is thereby contrary to the aims and objectives of the NPPF and, in particular, LP1, LP3 and LP4, Publication Plan Policies 28–30 and the CA31 Sheen Road Richmond Conservation Area Statement."
