  "description": "It is proposed to reduce the three Leyland Cypress (in group G1) by approximately 4-5m in height and by 1-2m in spread. It is also proposed to reduce the crown of Bay T2 by 3-4m. The Leyland Cypress (G1) trees have been cited as causing damage to the neighbouring building. \r\n\r\nThe foundations of the neighbouring building aren't deep enough to be deflecting tree roots; The soil is highly shrinkable clay; Cypress roots were found in the trial pits; and the soil has been desiccated by the tree roots.",
