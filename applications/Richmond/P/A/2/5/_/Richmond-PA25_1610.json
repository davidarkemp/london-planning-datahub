    "Alternative Specification:\r\n\r\nThe tree may be pruned back to its established historical pruning points only. No reduction beyond these points is permitted.\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\nTree Health and Structure: Reducing beyond the historical pruning points can result in large wounds that the tree may struggle to compartmentalise. This increases the risk of decay and structural weakness, which could ultimately lead to the treeâ€™s decline or failure.\r\n\r\nAmenity Value: The tree is protected under a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) due to its significant contribution to local amenity. Excessive reduction would compromise its visual appeal and ecological function, diminishing the value it provides to the surrounding area."
