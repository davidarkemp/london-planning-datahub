    "The proposed development would, by reason of its siting, scale, proportions, appearance and fenestration represent a dominant, overbearing and unsympathetic form of development which will negatively impact on the appearance, form and proportions of the host property and harm the character and appearance of the wider area. As such the proposal would be contrary to policy LP1 of the Local Plan (2018) and policy 28 of the Publication Local Plan (Regulation 19). The proposal also fails to accord with the Council's 'House Extensions and External Alterations' (2015) Supplementary Planning Document."
