    "This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED. This is because it does not meet criteria laid down in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and any subsequent legislative amendments. The proposed scheme fails to comply with criterion A.1(i) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the proposed height of the extension, as annotated on submitted drawing(s), would be 3.85m at the eaves level and would be within 2m of the boundary."
