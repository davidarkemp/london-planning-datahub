    "The proposed outrigger dormer extension, by reason of its siting, scale and design, would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that would adversely impact the character and proportions of the host BTM and disrupt the consistency of the rear elevations within the group. The proposal causes less than substantial harm to the conservation area without any public benefit to outweigh this harm, contrary to Paragraphs 212, 215, and 216 of the NPPF, as well as Policies LP1, LP3, and LP4 of the Local Plan and Policies 28, 29, and 30 of the Publication Local Plan, the Supplementary Planning Document 'House Extensions and External Alterations' (2015), as supported by the CA1 â€“ Barnes Green Conservation Area Statement."
