    "Objections were received from neighbouring occupiers at No.7 Arlington Road. As required by Part A.4 the Local Planning Authority is required to assess the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of any adjoining premises. On assessment, the proposed sextension by reason of its combined depth, height, and siting would result in an unduly overbearing and visually obtrusive from of development resulting in an unacceptable sense of enclosure for, in particular, No.7 Arlington Road. The proposal is thereby contrary to the NPPF, Local Plan, in particular Policy LP8, and the 'House Extensions and External Alterations' SPD."
