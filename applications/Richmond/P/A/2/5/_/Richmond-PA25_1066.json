  "description": "The tree in question is a Magnolia tree which is located in the front garden of 294 St Margarets Rd. It is not a protected tree but is located in a conservation area. The trunk is located 1metre from the front boundary which borders a pedestrian pavement and the highway of St Margarets Rd. The trunk is also 2.3 metres from the boundary with 292 St Margarets Road and 2.7 metres from the boundary with 296 St Margarets Road. (see Location_Sketch.pdf). The crown of the tree has grown to cover most of the front garden of 294 St Margarets Road and is too big for the location. It overhangs the boundary of 296 St Margarets Rd, 292 St Margarets Rd as well as the pedestrian pavement to the front of 294 St Margarets Rd. (see photos P1, P2 and P3). The tree blocks light from 294 St Margarets Rd, 292 St Margarets Rd and 296 St Margarets Rd and therefore acts as a legal nuisance. The tree also overhangs the pedestrian pavement and is in very close proximity to the highway so that it represents a potential hazard to high sided vehicles and passing pedestrians.\r\nThe tree needs to be removed to stop the legal nuisance of blocking the light to 294, 292 and 296 St Margarets Rd and the potential hazard to pedestrians and vehicles at the front of 294 St Margarets Rd as it overhangs the pedestrian pathway and is now overhanging the highway. (see photos P1,P2,P3).\r\nThe tree could possibly be replaced by a smaller tree, more appropriate to the site.",
