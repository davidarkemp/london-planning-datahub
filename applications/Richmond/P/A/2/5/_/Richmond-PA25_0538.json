We would like to remove 3-3.5m all around which will reduce the tree to 13-15m Height and 9-11m wide.\r\n\r\nT2\tHolly\t\r\n- Reduce height down to previous points of reduction, approx. 2.5-3m. Current height about 4.5m. Width from fence about 3m\r\n- Reduce sides by 1.5-2m to create a tidy shape.\r\n\r\nT3\tHawthorn\t\r\n- Crown lift on road side only to provide 4m clearance from ground level and to clear bus stop signage.\r\n\r\nT4\tFig\t\r\n- Fell to ground and treat remaining stump with herbicide to prevent regrowth.",

    "The specification is not suitable and therefore needs to be confirmed. The specification needs to be measurable and quantifiable so that we can understand the amount that is to be removed in meters. We need to know the amount to be removed and the remaining crown size. E.g. 2m crown reduction in width and 2m reduction in height, leaving a canopy spread of 3m and height of 5m."
