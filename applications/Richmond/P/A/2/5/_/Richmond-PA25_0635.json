    "The proposed ground floor, first floor rear extension and roof extensions / dormers would, by reason of their siting, scale, proportions, appearance and fenestration represent a dominant, overbearing and unsympathetic form of overdevelopment which will negatively impact on the appearance, form and proportion of the host property and harm the character and appearance of the wider area. As such the proposal would be contrary to policy LP1 of the Local Plan (2018) and policy 28 of the Publication Local Plan (Regulation 19). The proposal also fails to accord with the Council's 'House Extensions and External Alterations' (2015) Supplementary Planning Document."
