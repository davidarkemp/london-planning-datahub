  "description": "T1.Holm Oak\t\r\nOutside Flats 1-6/Side of 14 River Reach:\r\nFurther to my site visit and ground inspection, I would recommend the following work to ascertain health and current condition, and also address the extension growth from previous pruning, which would lessen the potential for branches on the northeast crown flank to overhang the garden of 14 River Reach, and also branches on the southwest crown flank to clear the elevation of flats.\r\nPreviously, this tree has also had bracing systems installed as a support for the main forks; this appears to be old and needs adjustment and replacement.\r\n\r\nRecommended work;\r\nReduce new regrowth by 2m in the lower northeast-facing section of the crown flank, leaving suitable points for crown development and reducing overhang potential to the garden of 14.\r\nReduce new regrowth by 2.5m in the upper southwest-facing section of the crown flank, leaving suitable points for crown development and clearing the elevation by 5/6m.\r\nCarry out a climbing inspection to ascertain any adversities within the main structure, and remove broken branches and any deadwood over 2.5cm in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe tree's current height is 22m, and its  crown spread is 16m\r\nAfter the proposed works, the tree's height is 22m and the crown spread is 13.5m - 14m  (Not radial)",
