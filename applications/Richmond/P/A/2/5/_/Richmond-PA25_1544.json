    "To sustain and enhance local tree cover and amenity provision, replanting is required following the removal of the protected Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) (T1).\r\n\r\nFor each tree removed, a replacement of the same species must be planted in the same location during the next planting season after removal (November 2025 – March 2026). Each replacement must be a nursery-grown, container-grown tree of a minimum height of 3 metres and a girth of 10 cm at the time of planting. This specification corresponds to a 'standard' size as commonly defined by tree nurseries.\r\n\r\nGiven the ongoing issues affecting Horse Chestnuts, an Indian Horse Chestnut (Aesculus indica) may be used as an alternative replacement species. Please confirm with the council which species, Horse Chestnut or Indian Horse Chestnut, is being selected for replanting, so that records can be updated accordingly.\r\nIf, within a period of five years from the date of planting, the replacement tree (or any subsequent replacement) is removed, uprooted, destroyed, or dies—or is deemed by the local planning authority to be seriously damaged—it must be replaced in the next available planting season, or in accordance with a timetable agreed in writing with the local planning authority. The replacement must meet the original planting specification.\r\n\r\nAll planting must be carried out in accordance with the Code of Practice for General Landscape Operations (BS 4428:1989) and BS 8545:2014 – Trees: From Nursery to Independence in the Landscape.\r\n\r\nTo ensure successful establishment:\r\n\r\nTrees must be watered throughout the growing season (April to October), ideally using rainwater, to field capacity.\r\n\r\nMulching should be applied to reduce competition for water and prevent soil drying.\r\nStaking and tying must be maintained as necessary, with supports checked during each visit."
