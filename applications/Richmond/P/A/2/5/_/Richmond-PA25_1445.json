    "The proposed roof and first floor extensions, by reason of their combined inappropriate scale, bulk, siting, massing, size and design, would constitute unsympathetic and overly dominant additions and would unacceptably detract from and obscure the original roof pattern, form, character and proportions of the parent building, failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the streetscene and surrounding conservation area. The scheme does not accord with the statutory duty of Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and is contrary to Policies LP1 and LP3 of the Local Plan, policies 28 and 29 of the Publication Local Plan, Policy HC1 (C) of the London Plan (2021), paragraphs 212 - 215 of the NPPF (2024), and the House Extensions and External Alterations SPD as supported by the Sheen Common Drive Conservation Area 69 Statement."
