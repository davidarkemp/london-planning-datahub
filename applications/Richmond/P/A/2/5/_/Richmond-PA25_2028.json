  "description": "T1012 (T0361-T1) Deodar cedar: height 14m, DBH 1200mm; Crown spread N11m, E10m, SE14m, S11m, W11m; Medium sized deadwood 25mm to 100mm. Species susceptible to branch failure due to overloading of branches. Long and weighted lateral branch splays, however crown has been previously reduced. Attempts to arrest branch failure with ropes attached to northern and southern primary branches. Previous branch failure wound on western side of northern primary branch at 10m above ground level and 400mm from main stem h300mm x w1m. Southern branch at 5m above ground level has distorted growth, consistent with constriction due to something having been tied to it has weakened the branch and resulting in an abnormal risk of failure. Southern primary branch at 10m above ground level has been subject to previous pruning which is indicated by the presence of branch stubs. \r\nSpecification: Remove southern branch at 5m above ground level with distorted growth consistent with constriction, back to main union (and remove deadwood >25mm diameter).",
