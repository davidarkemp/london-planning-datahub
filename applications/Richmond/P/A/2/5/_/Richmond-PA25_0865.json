  "decision_conditions": [
    "To sustain and enhance local tree cover and amenity provision, replanting is required for removal of the protected horse chestnut, T18. \r\n\r\nIn this respect for each tree removed, you are required to replace it with the same species, or a stipulated species, and replant, in the same or similar positions, during the next planting season after removal (November 2025 - March 2026) with one nursery grown, container grown stock trees for each tree removed. These must be of a minimum size of 3m in height and 10cm girth at the time of planting. This is known commonly as size 'standard' from tree nurseries.\r\n \r\nStipulated species: Aesculus indica. These species are more resilient.\r\n\r\nIf within a period of 5 years from the date of planting that tree or any tree planted in replacement for it, is removed, uprooted, destroyed or dies (or becomes in the opinion of the local planning authority seriously damaged) then the tree shall be replaced to reflect the specification of the approved planting scheme in the next available planting season or in accordance with a timetable agreed in writing with the local planning authority.\r\n\r\nThe tree must be planted in accordance with the Code of Practice for General Landscape Operations BS4428 1989 and BS8545:2014 Trees: from nursery to independence in the landscape recommendations.\r\n \r\nTrees must be watered throughout the growing season (April to October) ideally with rainwater to field capacity to ensure establishment. Trees should be mulched to reduce competition for water and soil drying.  Stake and tie maintenance should be undertaken as required but support checked during each visit."
