    "It was noted during the site visit that there are likely to be containment issues between the canopy and the chimney stacks. The limbs in proximity to the chimney stacks could be reduced by 1 to 1.5 metres, while retaining sufficient photosynthetic material to support the tree’s health.\r\n\r\nThis reduction should be limited strictly to this area and not carried out in any other direction. The purpose of this work is to address an ongoing containment issue."

  "description": "T001 - Cedar of Lebanon - reduction works and replacement of Cobra bracing - It is recommended that the reduction of the specified parts of the crown is carried out by selectively reducing growth generally up to 1.5m. This can be increased to up to 2.5m in places where sufficient photosynthetic material can be retained so the likelihood of branch death is reduced.  In addition to the existing bracing, an additional section of bracing should be installed in the NW section of the canopy to provide some additional support beyond a potentially weakened union.\r\n\r\nAppeal – we have appealed the decision of the previous application for works to this tree. The appeal was submitted on the 24th September 2024 and we had the first response from The Planning Inspectorate on the 30th September 2024. The appeal reference is APP/TPO/L5810/10311. We are still waiting for a date for the site visit. In the meantime, there has been a branch failure (reported to The Planning Inspectorate on the 17th December 2024). a 3m crown reduction in width of crown diameter (1.5m radially) is proposed. This will be increased to 4m diameter reduction where there is sufficient remaining foliage to support increased branch reduction of up to 2.5m. No reduction in height is proposed. This leaves a canopy spread after reduction of generally 8m and in some places 7m and a height of 15m (from 11m diameter and 15m height being the current dimensions, prior to reduction works).",
