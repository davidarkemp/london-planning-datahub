  "description": "I would like to remove the Tree as indicated in the drawing before it becomes too big. This too would enable me to enlarge my utility area after the removal. The trees value to me and the community from a visual perspective is limited as it is not really seen that much from the street or myself. Therefore I am not sure if it is TPO or just conservation (I think it is only conservation) . And if permission is granted I would be happy to plant another tree (that will grow fairly large) by the one of the front gates (ideally to the right of front gate if looking from the street) if that would assist in this request being granted permission.",
