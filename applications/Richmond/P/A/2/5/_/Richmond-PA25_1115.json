Where the applicant considers parts of or the whole policy do not apply, this should be justified in a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES).  Draft guidance on Fire Safety Strategies is available at:\r\nhttps://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/london-plan-guidance/fire-safety-guidance-pre-consultation-information\r\n\r\nWhere the proposal includes a lift, the applicant should address the requirements of London Plan policy D5 within their Fire Safety Statement."
