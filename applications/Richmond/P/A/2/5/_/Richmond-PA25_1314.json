  "description": "T1. Swamp Cypress\t\r\nFront/Side of House:\r\nDue to its location and suppression by the adjacent Oak tree, this tree has required cyclical pruning to manage its volume. \r\nThe tree is approximately 20-25 years old and has already endured pruning work, which has altered its natural form.\r\nUnfortunately, the location of this tree is not ideal for the long term.\r\nSection fell to near ground level, treat stump with 'eco-plug' herbicide & leave for 6-8 weeks, in preparation for stump grinding.\r\nThe tree's current height is 11m, and crown spread is 4m\r\nAfter the proposed works, the tree's height is 0.0m and the crown spread is 0.0m.",
