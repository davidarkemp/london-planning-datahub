    "While a report was submitted in support of the proposed works, it does not constitute a full or conclusive tree assessment, as the proposed works are not sufficiently substantiated to justify intervention. \r\n\r\nAlthough the tree exhibits a lean and canopy bias toward the south-east, no evidence has been provided to demonstrate whether the lean is natural, or if there are any structural defects, decay, or imminent risk of failure. The tree appears to be in good physiological condition.\r\n\r\nThe species in question, a mature cedar, is known to be sensitive to pruning. The proposed 3m tip reduction and 1–2m all-round canopy reduction are considered excessive and likely to negatively impact the tree’s form, health, and amenity value. The works appear to be precautionary rather than necessary for the tree’s health or safety, and no alternative mitigation measures (e.g., selective pruning or bracing) have been explored."
