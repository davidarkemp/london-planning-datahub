    "The proposed rear extension, by reason of its scale, massing, proportions, materiality and fenestration, would result in an unsympathetic and incongruous form of development that fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the surrounding conservation area and host building of townscape merit. The scheme is therefore contrary to, in particular, policies LP1, LP3 & LP4 of the Local Plan (2018), Publication Local Plan (Regulation 19) policies 28, 29 and 30, and Supplementary Planning Document 'House Extensions and External Alterations' (2015) as supported by the Mortlake Conservation Area Statement and Mortlake Conservation Area Study."
