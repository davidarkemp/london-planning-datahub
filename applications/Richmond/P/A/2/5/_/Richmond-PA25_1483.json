    "The proposed two storey side and rear extension by reason of its height, scale, massing and design would represent an overly dominant and incongruous form of development which would fail to be subservient to the host property. This would negatively impact the character and appearance of the host property and streetscape. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the NPPF, and the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Local Plan (2018), in particular policy LP1, the House Extensions and External Alterations SPD and the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Local Plan Publication (Regulation 19) Local Plan (2023) policy 28."
