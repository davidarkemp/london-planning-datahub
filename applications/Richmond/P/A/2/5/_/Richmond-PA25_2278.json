    "In accordance with paragraphs 38-42 of the National Planning Policy Framework, Richmond upon Thames Borough Council takes a positive and proactive approach to the delivery of sustainable development, by:\r\no\tProviding a formal pre-application service\r\no\tProviding written policies and guidance, all of which is available to view on the Council's website\r\no\tWhere appropriate, negotiating amendments to secure a positive decision\r\no\tDetermining applications in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIn this instance:\r\no\tThe applicants did not seek formal pre-application advice, and the scheme was found to be contrary to policy and guidance, and subsequently refused. The Council is ready to enter into discussions, through the Council's formal pre-application service, to advise the applicants of relevant policy and guidance; and where possible assist in the preparation of a new planning permission.  More information on the pre-application service and relevant fees can be found online at www.richmond.gov.uk/pre-application_for_developers."
