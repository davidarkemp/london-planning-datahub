    "The proposed first floor and dormer extensions by reason of their scale and design would result in an overly dominant and incongruous development which relates poorly to both existing structures as well as the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, resulting in less than substantial harm to the Conservation Area and harm to both locally listed Buildings of Townscape Merit. There are no benefits to outweigh this harm. As such, the proposals are contrary to Policies LP 1, 3, or 4 of the Local Plan (2018) as well as LP28, LP29 and LP30 of the Publication Local Plan."
