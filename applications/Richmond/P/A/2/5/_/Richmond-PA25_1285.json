  "description": "Crown reduction / pruning of apple tree to maintain balanced shape, improve tree health and prevent excessive shading of other trees\r\nThis application is related to a single apple tree (malus domestica) in the garden of 3 Dynevor Road. The tree does not have a TPO. The tree is planted adjacent to the wall between the gardens of 3 Dynevor Road and 2 Dynevor Road.\r\nThe application is being made by the residents of 2 Dynevor Road for a crown reduction on the part of the tree overhanging the garden of 2 Dynevor such that the tree has a balanced shape. \r\n2 Dynevor Road was unoccupied for a substantial period of time during which routine pruning on the 2 Dynevor side of the apple tree was not undertaken. This is now required to benefit the treeâ€™s health and shape. \r\nFurthermore, the overhanging branches of the apple tree are providing excessive shading to new prunus and magnolia trees planted in the garden of 2 Dynevor Road. This is shown in the attached sketch.\r\n\r\nThe height of the tree overhanging the garden of 2 Dynevor Road will be reduced to approximately 5 metres which is consistent with the height of the rest of the tree in the garden of 3 Dynevor. The spread of the tree after pruning will be approximately 3 metres. None of the branches pruned will have a diameter greater than 5cm and there will be no cuts to the main stem. \r\n\r\nThe owners of 3 Dynevor Road have verbally consented to the pruning.",
