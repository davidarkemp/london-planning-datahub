  "description": "Reduce lateral growth by up to 2m and crown thin canopy by 20%. The estimated height of the canopy/tree is currently estimated to be over 15 metres. The estimated lateral spread of the canopy running parallel with the road and over both our property and Number 2 Orchard Rise is about 17 metres and the spread of the canopy running perpendicular to the road towards our house on one side and out over the road on the other side is  also about 17 metres and level with the outer wall/windows of the house. To  leave the diameter/spread in both directions at 15 metres. As to height, the application is to crown thin the canopy by 20%. This thinning would we suggest reduce height by up to 1 metre from an estimated 15 metres to 14 metres\r\n\r\nThe aim is to be consistent with the pruning and approval that has been granted on several previous occasions including lastly in 2019.",

    "The following specification was granted in 2019. To maintain consistency with that approval, the Council is permitting the same specification as an alternative to the currently proposed works:\r\n\r\n'T1 – Cedar – Reduce lateral growth by up to 1m (MAXIMUM) and crown thin outer canopy by 10–15% on the roadside of the tree. Reduce lateral spread by up to 2m (MAXIMUM) and crown thin outer canopy by 10–15% from over the owner’s property and neighbouring property to allow space for greater canopy development. No height reduction is permitted with this specification.'\r\n\r\nPlease note: crown thinning involves the selective removal of branches to reduce canopy density and improve light penetration and air flow. It does not include any reduction in the overall height of the tree."
