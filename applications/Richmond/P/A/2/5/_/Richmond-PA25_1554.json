  "description": "One multi-stemmed poplar tree which we require to be removed. One Sycamore tree that we require to be removed. If permission granted the trees will be dismantled, disposed of and the roots removed to allow for piling. \n\nWe are piling around the island to stop the erosion and improve the heath and safety of our tenants and visitors. The property line has been determined with the council and the environment agency. IMG_03 and IMG_04 show the blue line that has been determined as our boundary and therfore requires a steel pile to be installed. This is also where we are required to install wildlife bays to help with the ecology of the river so we would need to remove the small sycamore behind the poplar. IMG_01 and IMG_02 show the two trees while stood back. The piling work cannot be completed with these two trees remaining and would really appreciate approval to remove. \n\nI would propose replanting a poplar and a sycamore. Very happy to plant different species if you would prefer. \n\nThe sketch plan is the western part of Platts Eyot. The red X indicates the location of both trees as they are less that a meter apart. I have attached red and white tikka tape to the tree so they are easily identifiable to the tree officer. \n\nI know I asked for the previous application to be rushed through but i would mighty appreciate if the same could be done with this one. This has been another oversight from the engineer for this job.",
