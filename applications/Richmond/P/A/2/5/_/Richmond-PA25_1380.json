  "description": "It is proposed to reduce the three Leyland Cypress (in group G1) by approximately 4-5m in height and by 1-2m in spread. It is also proposed to reduce the crown of Bay T2 by 3-4m. The Leyland Cypress (G1) trees have been cited as causing damage to the neighbouring building. \r\nThe trees are 16m high, so the crown reduction will result in them being around 11-12m high.\r\nThe hedge will end up being about 12m long and 6m wide.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the neighbouring building aren't deep enough to be deflecting tree roots; The soil is highly shrinkable clay; Cypress roots were found in the trial pits; and the soil has been desiccated by the tree roots.",
