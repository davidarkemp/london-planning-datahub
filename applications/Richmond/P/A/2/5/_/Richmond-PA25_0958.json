  "description": "T2 - Cedar - Carefully fell to near ground level.\r\nT2 - recommendations are based on findings from the drillings and observations made on the day of the inspection, there is extensive decay in the main stem of the tree, please see the resistograph results in the attached documents. There is also an extensive lean of the main stem towards the communal entrance of the school, which would be considered a high target area. Therefore the only acceptable reduction of risk is to remove this tree in its entirety.\r\nThe last application was withdrawn as the Tree officer required more testing to be carried out, that has now been completed and the tomograph report is attached in the documents.",

    "There is a duty under the planning acts to replace any tree removed if the tree was subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) or growing within a Conservation Area and was removed due to being dead or dangerous, or if the tree has been removed under exemption.  \r\n\r\nWe would be grateful if you would advise us of your arrangements for replacing the tree to be removed with details of the tree species, size at planting time and intended time of replacement so that we can assess the suitability and timing of the planting."
