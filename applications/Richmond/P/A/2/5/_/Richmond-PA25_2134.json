  "description": "The tree is an established ash tree at the bottom of our garden, over our garden, number 33 and the river inlet between Broom Water and Broom Water West. In July 2023, a sizeable branch fell and we asked for support from a tree surgeon who pruned and cut back the tree. This took place again in December 2024. Over the last few weeks i have noticed that there are several branches that are without leaves, in patches all over the tree - The tree is unsafe and it is in my own families best interest, as well as the wider Broom Water community for this to come down.",
