  "description": "Holm Oak\r\nT1 is a mature Holm Oak Tree (Quercus ilex) located at the rear of Clifton Lodge (TW1 1QN), home of the Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance in the area between the pilates room, and the rear of the Anya Linden Studio Theatre extension to Clifton Lodge that was completed 2005-7. \r\nThis area includes a small outside gym which is used by the students of the school. The tree is in need of maintenance in order for it to retain its shape, control its size and improve air circulation. This Holm Oak is situated in the middle of a temporary tent covering. The School is currently applying to renew and make permanent a tent covering to protect the outside gym.  We have consulted with our neighbours in Kilmorey Road and they have no objections to these plans.\r\n\r\nOur tree surgeon has advised that the tree should be pollarded back to previous points to maintain the Holm Oak. The Holm Oak is heavier on one side and this will be corrected. \r\n\r\nThe current height of the tree is 10 m high by 10m wide. \r\n\r\nThe crown height and width pollarding will be 2.5m from the crown.\r\n\r\nWe will undertake a crown lift of 1m and and crown thinning. \r\n\r\nThe width of the tree will be reduced by 2.5m in total 1.25 each side of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe size of the tree on completion will be 7m high and 7m wide.",
