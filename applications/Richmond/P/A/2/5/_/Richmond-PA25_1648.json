  "description": "Ash - Tag B0572 - Fell, due to Innonotus hispidus on main stem. Stem located on Barge Walk.\r\n\r\nFalse Acacia  - Tag B0557 - Retrechment prune, selective 2m reduction to reduce height by 2m and crown spread by 2m due to significant dieback. Resulting in stem to be 6m tall with 4m crown spread.\r\n\r\nHorse Chestnut - Tag R0093 - Fell tree due to high target area, located next to zebra crossing and road junction. Poor physiological condition and signs of significant bleeding canker. Previously reduced and poor response. \r\n\r\nIndian Horse Chestnut - Tag G0384 - Young bracket fungus, suspected Rigidiporus ulmaris to northern basal area. Crown becoming overextended in small growing space, encroaching on third party property. Reduce whole crown by 4m from 14m spread to 10m and 21m in height to 16m to contain and reduce wind loading effects on unions. \r\n\r\nBramley apple - Untagged - Crown becoming too large for space and encroaching on building. Reduce whole crown by 3m in height and crown thin all around to previous pruning points. \r\n\r\nBeech - Tag G0825 - Mature beech with Kretzschmaria at base and cavity at 3m to south stem. Decay detection (resistance drilling and PICUS Tomograpgh carried out April 26th 2025) Consultant report received 09/05/2025. Reduce canopy selectively by 4m and drop crotch heavily weighted lateral limbs to manage stem decline, remove any deadwood. Consultant Report attached.",
