  "description": "This is a Japanese cherry plum tree which sits at the rear border of the rear garden of 4 Wick Road. Its stem is ca. 25cm in diameter. In full bloom it has a height of ca. 7m. We are proposing to remove the tree and plant a new cherry tree ca. 50cm to the left of the current tree (when viewing from the rear garden). The reasons are as follows: In October 2023 the garden was re-landscaped by James Larking Landscapes Ltd, Ashford, as part of the wider full refurbishment of the house. James Larkin inspected the condition of the tree and raised concerns regarding its stability, mentioning, there could be a risk of the tree collapsing in a storm. In August 2024 Dexters Property Management informed us that the current tenants of the house had observed a large branch falling off the tree. In April 2025 two tree surgeons inspected the tree: Rosy Gardens remarked that the tree is 'really quite unstable' while Living Stone Plants London remarked that 'there was no imminent safety risk but that tree will need to be removed at a point, and that it could become unstable if there is high wind.' As landlords we are concerned for the safety of our tenants and our neighbours. In our view the tree should be removed and replaced. Seeking your consent.",
