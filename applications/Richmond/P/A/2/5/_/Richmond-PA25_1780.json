Reduce the eastern canopy spread from 4.5m to 4m. Reduce the southern canopy spread from 3m to 2.5m. Reduce the western canopy spread from 2m to 1.5m. Reduce the overall height from 8m t0 7.5m.\r\nCanopy of T3 to be pruned in a manner which creates a neat, tidy crown without spoiling the appearance of the tree.\r\nPrune foliage by a maximum of 0.5m to create a neat, tidy canopy without spoiling the appearance or form of the tree.\r\nT5 (a 10m tall Cherry) - Fell to ground level.\r\n\r\nAll three trees are located in the rear garden of the subject property; none are clearly visible from public vantage points.\r\nThe clients intention is to alleviate nuisance, increase lighting levels and increase useable garden space.",

The specification needs to be measurable and quantifiable so that we can understand the amount that is to be removed in meters. We need to know the amount to be removed and the remaining crown size. E.g. 2m crown reduction in width and 2m reduction in height, leaving a canopy spread of 3m and height of 5m."
