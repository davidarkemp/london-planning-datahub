    "The Council has recently received a Section 211 Notification (Ref: PA25/1284) proposing the removal of two sycamore trees (Acer pseudoplatanus) located in the car park to the rear of 68â€“70 Richmond Hill.\r\n\r\nThese trees form a prominent landscape feature within the locality and are clearly visible from Cardigan Road and parts of Richmond Hill. Their removal would result in a notable detrimental impact on both the local and wider landscape character.\r\n\r\nThe justification provided in support of the proposed removal is considered insufficient to demonstrate that the trees require removal. As such, the Council considers it expedient in the interests of amenity to safeguard the trees by making a Tree Preservation Order."
