  "description": "THE TREE IS A PLANTANUS X HISPANICA - T1 LONDON PLANE\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nTo install decorative lighting by wrapping a rope or similar non-abrasive line around the trunk of a protected tree, without fixing or attaching any hardware or penetrating elements directly into the tree.\r\nMaterials:\r\nSoft, non-abrasive rope or tree-friendly strapping (e.g., polypropylene or jute).\r\nLighting fixtures designed for outdoor use, lightweight and low-heat output (e.g., LED string lights).\r\nRubber or foam padding as required to provide additional protection at contact points.\r\nMethodology:\r\nRope will be loosely wrapped around the trunk at intervals, avoiding excessive tension or pressure.\r\nThe rope will serve solely as a suspension support for the lighting, distributing weight evenly without compressing or constricting any part of the tree.\r\nNo nails, screws, hooks, staples, or any other penetrating fixtures will be used on the trunk, limbs, or branches.\r\nLighting cables will be attached to the rope itself, not the tree, using soft ties or clips that can be removed without leaving residue or damage.\r\n\r\nAll installations will be conducted manually from the ground or using ladders; no mechanical equipment or climbing will be employed\r\nCompliance:\r\nAll works will comply with local Tree Preservation Order (TPO) regulations.\r\nA qualified arborist will be consulted if any doubt arises regarding the impact of the proposed installation.\r\nSketch Plan - REF 001",
