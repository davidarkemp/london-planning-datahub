    "This proposal CONSTITUTES DEVELOPMENT within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application IS REQUIRED. This is because it does not meet criteria laid down in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and any subsequent legislative amendments. The proposed scheme fails to comply with criterion A.1(j) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as the proposed extension would extend beyond the side elevation of the rear bay window and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse."
