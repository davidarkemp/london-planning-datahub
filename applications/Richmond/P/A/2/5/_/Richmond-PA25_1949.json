The Fire Safety Strategy should be presented as a standalone document with a clear structure that addresses the criteria set out in London Plan Policy D12 part A.  The submitted drawings should address the requirements set out at paragraphs 3.12.3 and 3.12.4 of the London Plan. Where the applicant considers parts of or the whole policy do not apply, this should be justified in a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES).  Draft guidance on Fire Safety Strategies is available at:\r\nhttps://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/london-plan-guidance/fire-safety-guidance-pre-consultation-information\r\n\r\nWhere the proposal includes a lift, the applicant should address the requirements of London Plan policy D5 within their Fire Safety Statement."
