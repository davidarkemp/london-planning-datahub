  "description": "T1 Gleditsia triacanthos: Fell \r\n\r\nJustification for Removal\r\n1. Unsuitable Species for Location\r\nGleditsia triacanthos is a large, fast-growing deciduous tree with an eventual height of over 12–15 metres. It is inappropriate for modest residential gardens due to its vigorous growth, broad canopy spread, and strong root system. In this case, the tree’s position in a small urban garden already exceeds the available space, with roots and canopy encroaching into areas they cannot be contained, posing risk to garden surfaces, neighbouring structures, and subsurface infrastructure.\r\n\r\n2. Ongoing Management Burden\r\nThough not yet mature, the tree already needs regular pruning to control spread. Annual or biennial crown reductions are essential to reduce shading, prevent crown overhang into adjacent properties, and minimise root incursion. These repeated works cause ongoing cost and disruption and are not a permanent solution. The tree regenerates quickly after pruning, leading to a cycle of intensive, unsustainable maintenance.\r\n\r\n3. Adverse Impact on Garden Use\r\nThe tree’s scale and placement dominate the garden, limiting recreational use, planting, and design. The canopy casts dense shade, making lawn growth and other planting difficult. The low branch framework and lateral spread hinder use of space underneath. Though slightly offset, the tree occupies the heart of the garden’s usable area, restricting layout and enjoyment of the space.\r\n\r\n4. Limited Public Amenity Value\r\nWhile Gleditsia can be attractive in larger or open settings, this particular tree contributes no significant visual value in its enclosed setting. It is not visible from public roads or footpaths and does not form part of any notable view corridor. Its removal would have no impact on the wider streetscape or public visual amenity.\r\n\r\n5. No Loss of Screening or Habitat\r\nThe garden is already well screened with mature shrubs and boundary trees. Removing this tree will not reduce privacy or green cover. Ecological value is minimal, and felling will be timed outside bird nesting season (March to August) or subject to an ecology check if required.\r\n\r\n6. Replacement Planting (if Required)\r\nIf requested by the Council, a replacement tree of more suitable scale and species can be planted in a more appropriate garden position. Options include Amelanchier, Sorbus, or ornamental fruit trees. These provide seasonal interest and support biodiversity without causing structural or spatial issues.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThis Gleditsia is unsuited to its domestic setting. Its size, growth habit, and high management demands already affect garden use, and these impacts will worsen as it matures. Removal will relieve pressure on the space without affecting public views or habitat value. If needed, replacement planting can ensure continued contribution to garden ecology and aesthetics.",
