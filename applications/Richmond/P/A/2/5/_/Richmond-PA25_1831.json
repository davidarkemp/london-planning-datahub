  "description": "Replacement of existing timber windows with new, on a like-for-like basis, double-glazed. Existing windows already comprise a mix of original box frames and original sashes (first floor), and original box frames with non-original, double-glazed sashes (ground and first floor), which have been previously installed by others. The intention is to improve thermal performance without compromising the original features. Original details will be retained wherever possible. Sash horn details will be replicated, new timber will be white painted, and double-glazing will be slim-profile gas-filled units.",
