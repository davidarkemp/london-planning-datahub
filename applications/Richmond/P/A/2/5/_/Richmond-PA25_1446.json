  "description": "The sycamore tree which boundaries Jerome House, managed by Sneller Property Management has been brought to Historic Royal Palace's attention due to the damage the tree is causing to a metal rail fence. The tree was originally thought to be owned by the council but further investigation shows that HRP own the tree. We would like to fell/dismantle the tree in order to prevent further damage to the third party property.",
