    "This proposal constitutes development within the meaning of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, and a planning application is required for the reasons outlined below:\r\n\r\nThe proposed fenestration as well as the proposed material of the dormers would be of a different visual appearance to the windows and materials used on the rest of the house/roof.  The application does not confirm if the rooflights would protrude less than 150mm beyond the roof slope. The proposed side window on the south east elevation is not confirmed to be obscured glazed or non-opening. This would be contrary to Permitted development rights for householders: Technical Guidance and to Paragraph B.2 (a), (c), C.1 (b) and C.2 (a), (b) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
