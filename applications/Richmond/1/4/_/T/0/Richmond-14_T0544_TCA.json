  "description": "Ash tree, self seeded, has grown into and leans over my boundary on the councils Udney Gardens. This tree has twin trunks one has been pruned by previous owner of No. 23 Langham Road. The tree's base and roots are established in the footings of my boundary fence. One half of the tree is growing totally over the boundary and the upper half of the remainder is predominately hanging over my fence. This requires complete removal of the tree. The side of the house has the main drains running just a few inches from the roots of the tree and will eventually cause disturbance Its mother tree nearby has grown a crown of which the upper branches grow over the boundary line and therefore should be cut back.\rI would like both trees problems addressed. I have been the owner of the house only since 30April 2014. I am seriously considering replacing (with Council's approval) the wooden boundary fence with a more sympathetic and substantial brick wall using old stocks that blends in with the existing front side wall. I would also be happy to plant a replacement tree further from my boundary.",
