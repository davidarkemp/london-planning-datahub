  "description": "Pine tree approx 15-20 metres tall. The application is for 'Crown Reduction' and 'Crown Thinning' about 30%. The tree branches are overladen and very brittle with some dead sections in the tree. Several large branches have already fallen into the garden following the recent storms and some branches are hanging partially attached. There is a need to make the tree safe as children and pets are present in surrounding gardens, under these overhanging branches. The tree also needs thinning to encourage growth of the healthy branches.",
