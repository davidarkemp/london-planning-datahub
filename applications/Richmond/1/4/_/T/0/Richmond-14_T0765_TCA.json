  "description": "Under separate application, the front garden is being modified to provide off street parking space for two vehicles. This requires opening up the front of the property and providing a hard standing.  There are 4 trees that require removal for these works. We will replace and plant 4 x Hornbeam pleached trees further back into the garden.\rThe trees span the front of the garden, T1 a crab apple, T2,3 & 4 are fastigiate yews.  The fifth tree T5 is on the junction of the boundary between no 29,31 Marlborough Road and the public pavement.  The path narrows here too between the roots forcing up the tarmac pavement and the street lamppost.",
