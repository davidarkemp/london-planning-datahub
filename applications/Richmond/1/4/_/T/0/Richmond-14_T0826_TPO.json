  "description": "Cedar Tree. I would like to prune the tree so that it is the same size as its twin tree that sits within the cemetery grounds. The trees are very close to each other. The tree in the cemetery has been pruned over the years and it is now significantly smaller than the tree in my garden. I would like the tree in my garden to be of the same size. I would like the tree reduced because:\r-It takes over the whole of my garden. \r-It is now possible to sit or for children to play in the garden because needles, branches and bits are constantly falling from it. \r-All rooms at the back of my house are very dark. \r-We can see very little sky from the house and garden.\rI previously applied to reduce the tree size but now I am now applying for the tree to be reduced to the same size as its twin tree.",
