  "description": "We have spoken to a tree surgeon who has said if the tree is cut back it will get wider and wider in response. The tree blocks the entire lawn of the ground floor from sun light. It is pushing into the boundary fence. It is too close to the house and is dominating the view from all flats. It was planted by the owner of the ground floor flat Ms Mulvaney and she now wishes to replace it with a Virbunum Bowantense 'Dawn'. It is also spoiling the use of our garden as it blocks light. The garden being shared and split into two. The view from our flat is also dominated by this tree it being only 20 ft from the house but probably 30 - 40 ft in height and amost as wide.",
