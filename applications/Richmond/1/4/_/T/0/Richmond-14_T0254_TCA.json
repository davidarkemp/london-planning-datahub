  "description": "There are two trees in our tiny front garden.\rThe Yew tree is very close to the front elevation of the building.\rIt blocks out light and it has been confirmed by a structural engineer that the roots are causing damage to the foundations. It has been recommended that we remove the tree and underpin the front elevation to avoid subsidence.\rI am about the exchange on the property but nervous that the council will not allow me to remove the tree and therefore the property in time will be subject to subsidence. I would hugely appreciate a speedy response to this due to our exchange - however I understand you also have a huge pile of applications to get through. I would like to keep the magnolia tree if possible. However for the case of this application, I would like to know if I had to remove both, whether it was possible (question) I called up the TPO department and they have confirmed that there are no TPO's in place for our property, but as its in a conservation area I will need planning. I very much look forward to hearing from you.",
