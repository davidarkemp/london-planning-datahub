  "description": "The current brick-built garden wall of the property facing the Locksmeade Road sits at the moment 2.5metres away from the road.\rAs we own the land between the wall and the road, we would like to 'move' the current wall by demolishing it and rebuilding it 50cm from the road, from bricks matching current ones and same 1.8 metres height. This way we would be able to incorporate this area within the private garden, which is quite small for a 4 bedroom house. \rThe wall also has a gate allowing access to the private garden and this would be moved along with the wall. We would need to extend the back wall and also create a side wall, also to be built from bricks matching existing, to allow a full enclosure within the private garden,\rThe 50cm area between new wall and the road will be planted with bushes/hedge.",
