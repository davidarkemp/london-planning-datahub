  "description": "Non-material amendment to conditions 2 (approved plans) and 15 (screening for the southern sides of the three rooftop amenity spaces) to allow:The internal layouts on the ground floor have been modified by incoming tenants but this has not affected the overall area/massing of the development. As the ventilation requirements for the project have been finalised some of the panels above the external doors on the ground floor have been varied between metal panels, louvered or glazed as required. A ventilation louver on the GF north west corner to the substation onto First Way has been removed/designed out. The door to this substation has been modified slightly. The external central double door arrangement in the south-eastern courtyard has been replaced by 2 single off centred doors to suit new internal layout. Previous discrepancy in the landscape setting out has required the introduction of steps and ramp on the north fa‡ade as the levels here are higher than previously design to. The external doors to the 3 seminar rooms on the north fa‡ade next to the substation have been removed due to this and steps have been      added to the emergency escape stairs. A window has been removed from the northern coffee lounge onto the parking area. Minor changes to the curtain walling setting out of the front entrance onto First Way. Revisions to the signage, detail of which form part of separate application. The laminated glazed balustrade on the first floor southern terrace has been replaced with a black balustrade with climbing plants to align with current building regulations part B. Railings to maintenance areas on Level 6 & Level 10 changed from stainless steel to dark grey. The communal lounge in the section of the building above 30 metres has been removed following extensive negotiations with London fire brigade due to fire safety concerns. The shell is retained for storage purposes only. The external amenity area in the two roofs where the communal lounges remain has been extended to comprise the whole of the roofs, with PV repositioned onto the higher roof. The cladding to the roof communal amenity lounges and the two flank walls where the building changes in height has been changed from engineering brick to dark/ light grey render for buildability reasons. 400mm black mesh balustrade added to the top of the roof parapet to meet the 1.8m balustrade requirement from the Unite/ student housing provider for safety reasons. of Full Planning Permission reference 17/3797 dated 21 June, 2018, for Demolition of the existing buildings and erection of a part 7/9/10/11 storey building, comprising educational use (Use Class D1), office use (Use Class B1(a)) and student accommodation (Use Class Sui Generis), with ancillary external landscaping subject to a Deed of Agreement dated 20 June 2018 under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended.",
