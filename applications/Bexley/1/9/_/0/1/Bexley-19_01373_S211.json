  "description": "Works to trees within a conservation area, being to fell one oak tree to ground level and reduction in crown level of one popular in rear garden\r\r\r\rT2. Large Poplar on Rear Boundary with Sidcup Recreational Club\rReduce crown height by approx 30% and bring the laterals in to create a neater shape and improve the structural integrity of the crown, (this translates as approx 4.5-5.5m from the height and 1-2m from the laterals where appropriate).\rThe aim is to create a smaller and less imposing crown to pro-actively manage the growth, debris and shading effects of the tree for future years.\rThe large tree has not been managed for many years. The height reduction will reduce the windsail and weight of the large crown, which is directly over a car park and family garden. Reducing to the natural points of the secondary crown will minimise any changes to the visual impact of the tree. The lateral reduction is limited to smaller diameter branches to minimise wounding. All branches will be cut to suitable growth points.",
